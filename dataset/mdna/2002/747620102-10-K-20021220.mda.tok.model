this acquisition expands the specialized design and manufacturing operations of quanex s engineered products division in the building products segment 
in july  the company sold piper impact europe  an impact extrusion facility based in the netherlands  to the plant s existing management group for a nominal amount 
the transaction was structured as a sale of stock 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a pretax charge of million for the fiscal third quarter ending july  in connection with the sale  the company s range forward foreign currency agreement with a notional amount of million guilders was closed 
this agreement was entered into to protect the company s investment in piper impact europe from foreign currency fluctuations 
the settlement of this agreement resulted in a gain  which was offset against the charge on the sale of piper impact europe 
on november   the company completed the purchase of all of the capital stock of temroc metals  inc temroc  a minnesota corporation for approximately million in cash 
temroc  as a surviving corporation  became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
temroc has production facilities in hamel  minnesota  where it manufactures customized aluminum extrusions and fabricated metal products for recreational vehicles  architectural products  electronics and other markets 
temroc has become part of the company s vehicular products segment and will continue to operate as a manufacturer of aluminum extrusions and fabricated metal products 
on february   quanex completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of ekamar  inc  formerly known as colonial craft  inc  a minnesota corporation  through its wholly owned subsidiary  quanex windows  inc  for approximately million in cash  million of which has been set aside in an escrow fund for environmental and certain other issues that may arise 
the business operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and has been renamed colonial craft  inc colonial craft

colonial craft has become part of the engineered products division within the building products business segment 
colonial craft provides direct synergy with one of the company s two core businesses  sharing a similar customer base with engineered products 
business segments business segments are reported in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
the company completed a strategic review of its business during fiscal  which resulted in a shift of strategy away from primarily a manufacturing process oriented enterprise to a more market focused enterprise 
the chief executive officer believes the focus on customers will provide a more effective corporate strategy to drive growth and shareholder value 
as expected  the review underscored a high concentration of sales in two market segments vehicular products and building products 
the company has made organizational and reporting changes aligned to this new strategy 
the chief executive officer evaluates performance and allocates the company s resources under this segment structure 
the vehicular products segment is comprised of macsteel  piper impact us operations only and temroc 
that segment s main driver is north american light vehicle builds 
macsteel s sales and operating income for fiscal represented approximately and  respectively of the segment s results 
the building products segment is comprised of engineered products and nichols aluminum 
the main drivers of this segment are residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures 
for fiscal  engineered products sales and operating income represented about and of the segment s results 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the company s two business segments years ended october  in thousands vehicular products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    building products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    fiscal results include nichols aluminum golden operations acquired january  and imperial products operations  acquired april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal results include temroc operations  acquired november see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal results include the million asset impairment charge relating to piper impact facilities in new albany  mississippi 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal results include colonial craft operations  acquired february see note to the consolidated financial statements 
within the vehicular products segment  strong north american light vehicle builds continued to drive demand for macsteel s engineered steel bar products 
this year s light vehicle builds  which had been estimated to be about million builds at the beginning of fiscal  will finish the calendar year closer to million  exceeding builds by approximately 
on top of these build rates  macsteel remains the supplier of choice and continues to capture new business 
ongoing lean manufacturing initiatives also contribute to macsteel s success 
the other businesses within the vehicular products segment also earned positive operating income for fiscal year however  piper impact experienced approximately a million loss in the fiscal fourth quarter as aluminum airbag sales continued to decline and new business was slower than expected 
new business prospects look promising  but meaningful sales volumes are slow to materialize 
within the building products segment  strong residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures during fiscal resulted in strong demands and operating results for both engineered products and nichols aluminum 
for engineered products  this strong level of demand  combined with improved productivity through lean manufacturing efforts  resulted in record net sales and operating income even without the results of the colonial craft acquisition 
outlook for  quanex believes it is in a position to outperform the markets it serves 
the company expects its primary drivers to be down slightly for fiscal when compared to levels 
however  it expects to offset nominal market weakness with more value added products at both macsteel and nichols aluminum  price relief at macsteel and new programs at engineered products 
market share gains at several business units should also bolster revenues 
on the cost side  lean manufacturing initiatives are expected to contribute to margin improvement 
quanex will continue to explore both internal and external growth opportunities in fiscal the company has purposely built a tough set of prerequisites for any acquisition candidate recognizing the fact that acquisitions have inherent risks 
generally  acquisition candidates must support one of the two core businesses macsteel or engineered products 
an acquisition candidate should have projections to earn in excess of its cost of capital by at least the third year 
quanex will continue to look for opportunities for internal growth 
currently the company is looking at ways to further increase both base load and value added capabilities of macsteel and ways to add more painted production at nichols aluminum with small investments 
the company s fiscal first quarter november  december and january is historically its least profitable as there are fewer production days due to the holidays  customers manage year end inventories tightly and the winter months reduce building product sales 
because this year s strong inventory replenishment activity during the first quarter is not expected to repeat in fiscal  the diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter may be near the results of this year s first quarter 
assuming a slowly recovering economy  the company would expect to report sequentially better operating results for the other quarters of fiscal compared to compared to net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to consolidated net sales for fiscal both the vehicular and building products segments experienced increased net sales 
net sales from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal were million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the prior year due to increases at macsteel  offset somewhat by lower net sales at both piper and temroc 
macsteel s net sales increase was due largely to a increase in volume  which more than offset lower selling prices compared to the fiscal over half of macsteel s business is based on fixed contracts  so their ability to change pricing was limited on a near term basis 
piper experienced lower net sales as aluminum airbag component sales declined from its prior year levels 
this decline was only partially offset by sales of new products  as meaningful sales volumes of these products have been slower to materialize than expected 
net sales from the company s building products segment for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal engineered products net sales increases were due largely to the acquisition of colonial craft in february 
nichols aluminum s net sales also increased from the prior year due to increased volume resulting from continuing strength in the building construction markets  despite lower selling prices 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to last year 
both the vehicular and building products segments experienced increased operating income 
operating income from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to last year 
this increase was due to higher operating income at macsteel compared to the prior year s results  partially offset by lower operating income at piper and temroc 
the higher net sales volume combined with productivity gains and lower conversion costs at macsteel more than offset the impact of lower spreads between selling prices and scrap prices 
piper and temroc had lower operating income for the periods due largely to lower net sales and volume 
depreciation expense for the vehicular products segment was higher with the completion of macsteel capital projects 
also contributing to the improvement in the vehicular products segment is the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective the beginning of the current fiscal year 
the vehicular products segment had goodwill amortization of approximately thousand in the prior year ended october  operating income from the company s building products segment for fiscal year was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase was a result of record operating income at engineered products  as well as improved results at nichols aluminum 
engineered products benefited from the acquisition of colonial craft in february  however it achieved record operating income levels without colonial craft s contribution due largely to strong demand for its products  productivity improvements and new product development and cost reduction efforts 
nichols aluminum also had increased operating income 
this increase was largely a result of increased volume and cost reduction initiatives  as well as a million business interruption insurance recovery collected during the year see note to the financial statements 
although spreads between selling price and raw material costs improved during the second half of the year  as compared to the same prior year period  for the year ended october   spreads were lower as scrap prices rose more quickly than nichol s ability to raise selling prices 
also contributing to the improvement in the building products segment is the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective the beginning of the current fiscal year 
the building products segment had goodwill amortization of approximately million in the prior year ending october  in addition to the two operating segments mentioned above  corporate level operating expenses for fiscal decreased by approximately million 
included in corporate and other are the consolidated inventory lifo adjustments  corporate office expenses and inter segment eliminations 
see note to the financial statements regarding lifo valuation method of inventory accounting 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  representing an increase of thousand  less than  when compared to last year 
this increase results primarily from the acquisition of colonial in february depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense excluding goodwill amortization increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
most of the increase came from the vehicular products segment due largely to recently completed capital projects at macsteel 
effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized 
goodwill amortization  on a consolidated basis  for the year ended october   was million 
see note to the financial statements for further information 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million last year 
the decrease in interest expense is due largely to the company s outstanding debt balance substantially decreasing year over year as the convertible subordinated debentures were converted to company stock or redeemed in june of and the company paid down its bank revolver and other interest bearing debt and notes 
see note to the financial statements for further information 
another factor affecting interest expense was the discontinuance of hedge accounting under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for the interest swap agreements 
based on future cash flow projections that were prepared during the second fiscal quarter ended april   it was determined there was a high likelihood the company would pay down its variable rate debt under the bank agreement revolver to approximately million by the end of this fiscal year 
based on these projections  a portion of the future projected cash flow being hedged interest payments would not occur 
therefore  during the period ended april   the company discontinued hedge accounting under sfas for million of the interest swap agreement and reclassified the related portion of other comprehensive income  a loss of million  to interest expense 
additionally  during the fourth fiscal quarter ended october   the timing of the finalization of the new bank agreement was determined 
since the swaps were designated as hedges of the bank agreement revolver  which was expected to terminate upon completion of the new bank agreement  the swap no longer qualified as a hedge  as those specific forecasted transactions would not occur future interest payments 
as a result  the company discontinued hedge accounting under sfas no 
on the swaps based on the projected new bank agreement date and reclassified the related portion of other comprehensive income  a loss of million  to interest expense 
the company however has not terminated or closed any of the million swap agreement and therefore the entire swap agreement s fair market value is reflected on the balance sheet 
see note to the financial statements for further explanation 
capitalized interest increased thousand for fiscal compared to the entire amount of capitalized interest is due to the long term capital expansion programs that were underway at macsteel 
these capital projects have been completed and the capitalization of interest ceased after the third fiscal quarter of other  net decreased thousand from fiscal during fiscal  as a result of the redemption of the subordinated debentures  a loss of thousand was recognized due to the early extinguishment of debt 
this loss resulted from the write off of the remaining debt issuance costs associated with the subordinated debentures  as well as the 
premium paid on the million of debentures which were redeemed 
fiscal included a thousand gain on the early extinguishment of debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which was adopted by the company in the period ended july   these early extinguishment of debt items were classified as ordinary instead of extraordinary items  net of tax 
also included in other  net is investment income and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
net income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in addition to the items mentioned above  fiscal included a non taxable million retired executive life insurance benefit 
see note to the financial statements 
compared to net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to fiscal both operating segments experienced decreased net sales 
net sales from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to fiscal macsteel experienced lower volume resulting from weaker markets in the transportation and capital goods industries as well as lower sales prices 
the business continued to experience pricing pressures  however  due to the increased proportion of macplus volume  a value added product  the impact on overall average sales price was lessened 
piper us operations net sales decreased over the same prior year period 
these results were impacted by declining aluminum air bag product sales and competitive pricing pressures 
comparable net sales of piper s operations  excluded piper europe 
also included in the vehicular products was the net sales of temroc which was acquired in november net sales for fiscal from the company s building products segment decreased by million  or  to million when compared to fiscal nichols aluminum s results for fiscal included a full year of nichols aluminum golden  which was acquired january  the decrease in net sales at nichols aluminum was due to lower volume as well as lower sales prices 
volume was affected by more severe winter weather during the first fiscal quarter than was experienced in the prior year  as well as a general economic slowdown 
these factors negatively affected the building and construction and truck trailer markets that nichols aluminum serves 
sales prices were also negatively impacted by the extremely competitive pricing environment  and the fact that other mills were aggressively seeking available business during the economic slowdown 
the lower net sales at nichols aluminum was offset however by increased net sales from engineered products 
the increase was largely due to the acquisition of imperial products in april of engineered products net sales also benefited from the capital expansion project at amsco  which was completed in november  and new product development initiatives 
corporate and other for the period ending october  included net sales from piper impact europe which was sold in july of operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  compared to million in  excluding the million loss on the sale of piper impact europe and the million asset impairment charge 
this represents a decrease of million  or as both the vehicular products and building products segments had lower operating income compared to fiscal operating income from the company s vehicular products segment was million for fiscal  representing a decrease of thousand  or  excluding the million asset impairment charge  when compared to fiscal at macsteel  the decrease was due largely to lower net sales resulting from the sluggish demand in the transportation and capital goods markets as well as competitive pricing pressures 
lower material scrap prices helped offset some of the impact of reduced volume and lower selling price 
the macsteel division experienced increased utility costs as energy prices rose and recognized higher depreciation expense with the completion of capital projects 
comparative operating income for piper impact us  excluding the fiscal million asset impairment charge improved million from the prior year s results  despite a decline in net sales 
this improvement is a result of lower costs realized from cellular manufacturing and cost cutting efforts as well as a million reduction of depreciation expense 
depreciation expense decreased due to the asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal also included in vehicular products were the operational results of temroc which was acquired in november operating income for fiscal from the company s building products segment was million  representing a decrease of million  or  from last year 
nichols aluminum experienced a decrease largely due to significantly lower net sales  lower spreads and higher energy costs 
on the other hand  engineered products experienced a increase in operating income from fiscal the increase at engineered products was due in part to the acquisition of imperial products  acquired in april of additionally  operating income increased at the other facilities as a result of new product development initiatives  higher net sales and improved productivity 
in addition to the two operating segments mentioned above  operating expenses for corporate and other for fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million from the million recorded in fiscal included in corporate and other are the corporate office expenses  impact of inventory accounting using lifo method and inter segment eliminations 
also included in corporate and other are the results of piper europe  which was sold in july for a loss of million dollars 
see note to the financial statements regarding lifo valuation method of inventory accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by thousand  or  in fiscal as compared to last year 
this increase largely resulted from the following items acquisitions of imperial products in april and temroc in november write down of assets held for disposition to estimated realizable value in the corporate and other segment and severance costs 
these increases were partially offset  however  by reduced expenses due to the sale of piper europe in july  and cost cutting initiatives throughout the company 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to last year 
macsteel  nichols aluminum and engineered products all experienced increased depreciation expense compared to last year due to the completion of capital projects as well as recent acquisitions 
piper impact s depreciation and amortization decreased substantially from the prior year due to the sale of piper europe in july of  as well as the reduced asset base  which resulted from the asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances during fiscal resulting largely from the temroc acquisition and the ineffective portion of the loss on certain interest rate swap derivatives recognized during that period 
see note and to the financial statements 
capitalized interest capitalized interest decreased by thousand in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the completion of the phase v capital project at macsteel in december of other  net other  net increased by thousand in fiscal as compared to last year primarily as a result of increased investment income

liquidity and capital resources total capitalization at october  was million  consisting of million of debt and million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio at the end of fiscal was compared with and at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower debt to capitalization ratio in fiscal resulted from the conversion of million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated debentures to million shares of company stock combined with redemption of the remaining balance in fiscal year and paying down approximately million of other debt instruments during fiscal year quanex was able to reduce the debt level as a result of cash provided from operations  cash received from the exercise of stock options and cash received from a retired executive life insurance policy

critical accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information becomes available and as the company s operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from estimates 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of collectibility 
this requires management to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine appropriate amount of allowance needed for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
this allowance is maintained at a level the company considers appropriate based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
these factors include historical trends of write offs  recoveries and credit losses  the careful monitoring of portfolio credit quality  and projected economic and market conditions 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance 
inventory the company records inventory valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the company s forecast of future demand and market conditions 
significant unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
risk management and derivative instruments the company s current risk management strategies include the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks 
the critical strategies include the use of commodity futures and options to fix the price of a portion of anticipated future purchases of certain raw materials and energy to offset the effect of fluctuations in the costs of those commodities  and the use of interest rate swaps to fix the rate of interest on a portion of floating rate debt 
these hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of gains and losses is recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity in accordance with sfas no 
the company evaluates all derivative instruments each quarter to determine if they are highly effective 
any ineffectiveness as defined by sfas no 
is recorded in the statement of income 
if the anticipated future transactions are no longer expected to occur  the unrealized gains and losses on the related hedge are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income 
see note to the financial statements for further explanation 
long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment and further reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired 
the carrying values are compared with the fair value of such assets calculated based on the anticipated future cash flows related to those assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and future market conditions 
significant and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability reflects the company s assumption that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize its deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
this could result in additional income tax expense in a future period in the consolidated statement of income 
retirement and pension plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate  which is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities  is applied against the projected pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset investment performance will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year  which ultimately affects future pension costs

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a bank agreement  interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october  and  the company had fixed rate debt totaling million and million  respectively 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations total million and million at october  and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has million of swap agreements to limit the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates 
these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments are made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate and at october  and  respectively 
at october  and  the fair market value related to the interest rate swap agreements was a loss of million and a loss of million  respectively 
if the floating rates were to change by from october levels  the fair market value of these swaps would change by approximately thousand and thousand as of october  and  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
as mentioned above  million of the floating rate obligations are protected by interest swap agreements 
to the extent these obligations are in excess of or less than million  the company is subject to changes in the underlying interest rates 
for the year ended october   the company s floating rate obligations were million less than the million swap agreement 
increases or decreases in the underlying interest rate of the swap agreement would have a direct impact on interest expense for this differential in balances 
for the year ended october   the company s floating rate obligations exceeded the amount covered by the swap agreements by million 
increases or decreases in the underlying interest rates of the obligations would have a direct impact on interest expense for those uncovered balances 
commodity price risk the company s aluminum mill sheet products segment  nichols aluminum  uses various grades of aluminum scrap as well as prime aluminum ingot as a raw material for its manufacturing process 
the price of this aluminum raw material is subject to fluctuations due to many factors in the aluminum market 
in the normal course of business  nichols aluminum enters into firm price sales commitments with its customers 
in an effort to reduce the risk of fluctuating raw material prices  the company enters into firm price raw material purchase commitments as well as forward contracts on the london metal exchange lme 
the company s risk management policy as it relates to these lme contracts is to enter into contracts to cover the raw material needs of the company s committed sales orders  net of fixed price purchase commitments 
with the use of firm price raw material purchase commitments and lme contracts  the company aims to protect the gross margins from the effects of changing prices of aluminum 
to the extent that the raw material costs factored into the firm price sales commitments are matched with firm price raw material purchase commitments  changes in aluminum prices should have no effect on the company 
where firm price sales commitments are matched with lme contracts  the company is subject to the ineffectiveness of lme contracts to perfectly hedge raw material prices 
at october   the company had no open lme forward contracts and therefore no asset or liability associated with metal exchange derivatives 
during the year ended october   nichols aluminum used firm price raw material purchase commitments instead of lme forward contracts to lock in raw material prices 
at october   the company had open futures contracts for aluminum pounds with a fair value of million 
the contracts had fair value losses of million at october  and covered a notional volume of  pounds of aluminum 
a hypothetical change from the october  average london metal exchange lme ingot price on open contracts of 
per pound would increase or decrease the unrealized pretax gains losses related to these contracts by approximately million 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the cost of purchased aluminum scrap
