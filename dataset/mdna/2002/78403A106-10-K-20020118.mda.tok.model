item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k  and contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
caldera s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we began operations in as caldera  inc in july  through an asset purchase  caldera  inc acquired an additional business unit that was not engaged in developing and marketing linux software 
caldera  inc subsequently made the strategic determination to separate its two business lines into separate entities and  under an asset purchase agreement dated as of september   as amended  sold the assets relating to its business of developing and marketing linux software to caldera systems  inc  a newly formed corporation 
caldera systems subsequently completed an initial public offering in march on may   caldera systems completed its acquisition of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of tarantella inc  formerly known as the santa cruz operation  inc  pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated august   as subsequently amended the tarantella acquisition 
in order to facilitate this acquisition  caldera international  inc was formed and caldera systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of caldera international 
former holders of shares and options to purchase shares of caldera systems received an equal number of shares and options to purchase shares in caldera international 
as used herein  caldera  or the company  refers to caldera international  its subsidiaries  and its two predecessors  caldera systems and the portion of caldera  inc related to the linux software business 
prior to the acquisition of the unix and openserver product lines from tarantella  substantially all of our revenue was derived from sales of linux products and related services 
currently  over percent of our revenue is derived from sales of products acquired from tarantella 
results of operations the tarantella acquisition significantly increased the net revenue and operating expenses of the company 
consequently  fiscal is not directly comparable to fiscal and prior years because of the significant changes in the operations of the company as a result of the acquired operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company implemented cost cutting measures related to personnel and excess facilities in an effort to reduce overall operating expenses 
fiscal will also not be directly comparable to fiscal because the acquired operations will be included in our financial results for the full year 
as a result  we expect that operating expenses relating to sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative will increase for fiscal in absolute dollars  but will decrease as a percentage of revenue 
fiscal years ended october   and revenue revenue was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  approximately percent of our revenue was generated from the sale of products

the significant increase in revenue from fiscal over fiscal as well as the increase in the percentage of product revenue to total revenue  was attributable almost solely to the operations acquired from tarantella

cost of products revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million from fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of million  from fiscal to fiscal cost of products revenue as a percentage of products revenue was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the decrease in the cost of products revenue percentage in fiscal was attributable to the large number of internet and electronic distribution orders for products sold by the operations acquired from tarantella 
the decrease in the cost of products revenue percentage in fiscal from fiscal was due to increased efficiencies in the production and fulfillment process as well as from reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
for fiscal  we expect the cost of products revenue as a percentage of products revenue to remain similar to that experienced in fiscal cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of million from fiscal to fiscal cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the higher cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal and fiscal was attributed to initial infrastructure and other costs of establishing our services offerings 
for fiscal  we expect the cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue to decrease  and anticipate that the costs of services revenue may decrease to approximately the revenue realized from services 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of million from fiscal to fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented percent of total revenue in fiscal  percent of total revenue in fiscal and percent of total revenue in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal over fiscal was attributable to increased personnel and related costs as a result of the acquisition of the operations from tarantella  increased spending related to the branding of caldera international and costs incurred for product launches

the significant increase from fiscal to fiscal is the result of increased salaries and related costs associated with additional employees in finance  administration  legal and human resources consistent with our growth in headcount and overall business 
other increases in general and administration expense were for increased professional services and facilities costs 
write down of goodwill and intangibles 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that various assets related to the operations acquired from tarantella and acrylis were impaired and that the book value as of october  exceeded the current estimates of fair value 
as a result  we recorded a million write down of goodwill and intangible assets 
the asset write down is the result of significant unanticipated decreases in actual and forecasted revenue of the acquired operations  a significant decline in market valuations and general economic conditions  particularly in the information technology sector  a weakening of certain partner relationships  the loss of certain key executives and other factors 
during fiscal and the company did not have any write down of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
the company recorded million in non cash charges in fiscal for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of the assets and operations from tarantella and the whatiflinux technology acquired from acrylis  inc as a result of the asset write down discussed above and the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

engineering efforts are focused on developing the unixware and messaging server products 
unixware is expected to deliver purpose built operating system configurations designed to power departmental databases  application servers  intranet servers  mail and messaging servers and other environments specifically tailored to run telecommunications and other embedded environments 
at the time of the acquisition  tarantella had invested approximately man months of effort or approximately million in the unixware product and anticipated man months of effort or approximately million to complete unixware unixware was estimated to be approximately percent complete at the time of the acquisition 
the messaging server product is an entirely new product  which provides messaging functionality on top of existing unixware products

non cash compensation 
in connection with stock options granted to employees  the company recorded non cash compensation of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant decrease in non cash compensation from fiscal to fiscal is a result of lower compensation amounts related to recent option grants and the amortization of previously recorded deferred compensation on an accelerated basis 
cost sharing arrangement with tarantella  inc 
during august and after entering into the reorganization agreement with tarantella to acquire the server software and professional services groups  the company and tarantella agreed that caldera would reimburse tarantella for certain employee payroll and related costs 
the costs for which the company agreed to reimburse tarantella were related to employees that tarantella had identified for termination in a company wide layoff in september the company viewed these employees as a critical part of the success of the new combined company and tarantella agreed to retain the employees if the company would reimburse tarantella for a portion of their payroll and related costs 
at the time the company committed to reimburse tarantella for these employee costs  the ultimate amount was not determinable and both parties agreed that the amount would be determined prior to the completion of the acquisition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company has maintained many of the foreign offices and operations associated with the assets and operations acquired in may from tarantella 
as a result  a substantial portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
a significant portion of this international revenue is denominated in us dollars 
however  a substantial portion of the operating expenses related to the foreign based sales are denominated in foreign currencies and therefore operating results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the uk pound sterling and the euro  among others 
if the uk dollar weakens compared to the uk pound sterling and the euro  then operating expenses of foreign operations will be higher when translated back into us dollars and additional funds may be required to meet these obligations 
the company s revenue can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or general economic conditions 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the new european economic and monetary union the emu 
one of the changes resulting from this union required emu member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  on january  on that day  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the subsequent two years  business in the emu member states will have been conducted in both the existing national currencies  such as the franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
management has revised its current business practices and products to address europe s conversion to the euro 
however  there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a materially adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
because the emu member states fixed the value of their respective national currencies to the euro  the dispositive exchange rate for determining the effects of foreign currency fluctuation on the results of operations of a us company earning significant revenues from europe is the us dollar euro exchange rate 
the overall trend since the adoption of the euro in january has been a devaluation compared to the us dollar 
historically  the company has not been materially affected by fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rates because the level of activity denominated in euros has not been significant 
interest rate risk the primary objective of the company s cash management strategy is to invest available funds in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and maximizes yield within such constraints 
a portion of the securities in which the company invests may be subject to market risk  which means that a change in prevailing rates or market conditions may adversely affect the principal amount of the investment 
to minimize this risk  the company invests in a broad range of short term fixed income securities with varying maturities 
the company does not borrow money for short term investment purposes 
we anticipate that the amounts we hold in interest rate sensitive instruments will decrease as our cash and cash equivalents and amounts held in available for sale securities are utilized in our business 
investment risk the company has invested in equity instruments of privately held and public companies in the high technology industry for business and strategic purposes 
investments in privately held companies are included under the caption other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for under the cost method if the company s ownership is less than percent and the company is not able to exercise influence over operations 
the company s only investment to date in a public company is in ebiz enterprises  inc the company s investment policy is to regularly review the assumptions and operating performance of these companies and to record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of approximately million for investments that were deemed to have experienced other than temporary declines in market value 
the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by the company or its competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in the company s results of operations caused by changes in customer demand may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s stock 
these conditions could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time
