item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed below  in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report

separation from adaptec we were incorporated in august as a wholly owned subsidiary of adaptec  inc  or adaptec  to conduct substantially all of the business of its software products group 
upon legal separation from adaptec in may  with the exception of approximately million in income taxes payable  adaptec transferred to roxio  inc  or roxio  substantially all of the assets and liabilities that appear on roxio s consolidated balance sheet  as well as million in cash  which included million in cash held by our overseas subsidiaries 
also on the separation date  roxio recorded a receivable of million and a payable of million with adaptec  which were previously included in owner s net investment 
for approximately months following the separation date  adaptec provided transitional services and support in the areas of information technology systems  supply chain  buildings and facilities  marketing and communications  finance and accounting 
specified charges for transition services were generally cost plus and  for products purchased from adaptec  cost plus 
although the fees provided for in the agreements 
table of contents were intended to represent the fair market value of these services  we cannot assure you that these fees necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing these services internally 
however  we believe that purchasing these services from adaptec provided an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
we do not believe that these arrangements with adaptec materially altered our financial position or results of operations during the transition period  substantially all of the agreements for transitional services have been terminated 
during fiscal  we negotiated new or revised agreements with various third parties as a separate  stand alone entity 
as part of adaptec  we benefited from various economies of scale including shared global administrative functions  facilities and product distribution 
in fiscal  our costs increased as a result of our becoming a separate  stand alone entity and our costs may increase further in the future as our transitional agreements with adaptec are terminated 
our business historically  we have derived most of our revenues through sales of our cd recording software products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which consist of pc and cd recordable drive manufacturers and integrators  and to distributors 
generally  oems bundle the standard version of our software together with their products pursuant to licensing agreements with us 
distributors resell stand alone platinum versions of our products to retailers of computer software products 
sales to oems represented of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sales to distributors and direct sales to end users through our website and toll free number collectively represented of our net revenues in fiscal  fiscal and in fiscal however  the number of units sold to our distributors and end users represented less than of the total number of units sold in each of those years 
in the future  we anticipate that cd recording technology revenues from our standard products to oems will continue to decline as a percentage of total net revenues  as a result of strong pricing pressures in the pc industry and the development of new technologies 
we anticipate that licensing fees for new features and technologies as well as increased revenues from sales of our platinum products will continue to represent an increasingly larger percentage of total net revenues in future periods 
international sales  defined as sales from our international subsidiaries  accounted for approximately of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal one customer accounted for of gross revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal a second customer accounted for of gross revenues in fiscal and in fiscal in july  we acquired cequadrat gmbh  or cequadrat  a german based software company providing cd recording software products primarily in germany 
the acquisition provided us with enhanced product development and engineering expertise  as well as a greater european customer base 
in march  we acquired wild file  inc  or wild file  the developer of our goback system recovery software 
in january  we acquired mgi software corp  or mgi software  a canadian company that develops and markets internet imaging products and digital video and photography solutions 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and the acquired company s results of operations are included in our financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets consist primarily of capitalized costs incurred through these acquisitions 
amounts related to other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets related to acquired workforce  which were reclassified to goodwill  on that date 
goodwill will be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
in addition  we periodically review the unamortized balance of other intangible assets to determine if the amounts are realizable and may in the future make adjustments to the carrying balance or amortization period based upon these reviews 

table of contents roxio stock option plan on december   a commitment was made to issue to employees of adaptec  who subsequently became employees of roxio at the date of legal separation  options to purchase million shares of roxio common stock with an exercise price of per share 
between december  and march   options to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share were committed to be issued 
due to the binding nature of the commitment  the date of the commitment to grant the options was assumed to be the date of grant 
the options will vest on the one year anniversary of the later of september  or the applicable employee s hire date and per quarter thereafter 
because the grants of roxio options constituted grants to non employees  the options were valued using the black scholes valuation model with the following assumptions expected life of years  risk free interest rate of  volatility of and dividend yield of 
in addition  because the number of options that would ultimately be granted was unknown at the commitment date  a measurement date for these options was not able to be established 
these options were therefore subject to variable plan accounting treatment  resulting in a re measurement of the compensation expense at march  and at the date of legal separation based on the then current market value of the underlying common stock 
compensation was recognized under the model prescribed in fin no 
amortization of the compensation of approximately million for the year ended march  and approximately  for the year ended march  related to the period before legal separation was recorded and was included in stock based compensation charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
the measurement date was established on the date of legal separation at which time certain employees of adaptec became employees of roxio and options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of roxio common stock were granted to these employees under the roxio stock option plan 
pursuant to fin no 
 at the date of change in status from non employees to employees  the accounting basis for the options changed and the compensation associated with these options was re measured and fixed using the intrinsic value at that date as prescribed by apb opinion no 
the remeasurement resulted in the recording of deferred stock compensation of approximately million  which is being amortized over the vesting periods of the respective options 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we also granted to employees options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock at prices below the current fair market value and recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million related to these options 
this amount will be amortized over the vesting periods of the respective options  which varies based on the individual employee s contribution to roxio 
issuance of common stock and warrant on may   we entered into a strategic relationship with virgin holding inc  or virgin  an indirect subsidiary of emi group plc  to  among other things  develop technology solutions relating to cd recording technology 
as part of the agreement  virgin provided strategic guidance and advice to roxio for a one year period 
simultaneously with the execution of the agreement  virgin purchased  shares of roxio s common stock at a price of per share 
in the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million in deferred stock based compensation was recorded for the common stock issued 
amortization expense of approximately  related to the common stock is included in stock based compensation charges in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal virgin also received a warrant to purchase  shares of roxio s common stock at a price equal to per share 
the warrant becomes exercisable by each quarter following the initial agreement 
the warrant expires on may  stock based compensation charges of approximately million related to the warrant were recorded and are included in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 
table of contents basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on march unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
prior to legal separation on may   we conducted our business as an operating segment of adaptec 
our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to legal separation have been carved out of the consolidated financial statements of adaptec using the historical results of operations of the adaptec software operating segment and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of adaptec that our company comprises 
certain software products directly related to adaptec s hardware products  which were historically reflected in our results of operations in adaptec s segment reporting  were retained by adaptec after legal separation 
as such  the revenues and associated costs of sales and operating expenses related to these products have not been included in our financial statements 
accordingly  the results reported herein do not reflect the software operating segment disclosures previously reported under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  within the adaptec annual reports 
prior to legal separation  the consolidated financial statements also included allocations to us of certain shared expenses  including centralized legal  accounting  finance  manufacturing  real estate  information technology  distribution  customer services  sales  marketing  engineering and other adaptec corporate services and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations have been determined on a basis that adaptec and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit received by us 
the allocations and charges are based on a percentage of total corporate costs for the services provided  based on factors such as headcount  revenue  gross asset value or the specific level of activity directly related to such costs 
the financial information presented in this annual report is not necessarily indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future nor is certain of the financial information presented in this annual report for periods prior to legal separation necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value or assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no  software revenue recognition 
we primarily sell our software products through two channels oems and distributors 
for software product sales to oems  revenues are recognized based on reported product shipments from oems to their customers provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for software product sales to distributors  revenues are recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all 
table of contents fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our distributor arrangements provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  we permit our distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
we establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
these allowances are recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and accounts receivable 
management uses significant judgment and relies heavily on historical experience in establishing these allowances 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  due to reduced demand for our product or other factors beyond our control  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
if at any point in the future we become unable to estimate returns reliably  we could be required to defer recognizing revenues until the distributor notifies us that the product has been sold to an end user 
costs related to post contract customer support pcs are accrued at the date the related revenues are recognized 
pcs obligations relate to telephone support and minor bug fixes downloadable from our web site 
as no separate charge is made for the pcs and the pcs is available for a period of less than one year  we do not ascribe any value to the pcs or defer any portion of revenue for it 
if pcs services become a more significant portion of our costs  we may be required to assign a portion of our revenues to pcs and recognize those revenues over the period of the pcs services 
for direct software product sales to end users  revenues are recognized upon shipment by roxio to the end users 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
generally  our customer payment terms do not exceed days 
in addition  we maintain a separate reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category and an analysis of our historical experience of bad debts 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for any build up to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
at march   one customer  a large distributor  accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable  including changes in general economic conditions  may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant changes in general economic conditions  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business  difficulty or delays in integrating an acquired business or a significant change in the operations of our business 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
estimating these cash flows requires management to make judgments about growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of our long lived assets 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we assess impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which require that a two step test be performed 
because roxio constitutes one reporting unit  as defined by sfas no 
 this 
table of contents test has been performed on a total company basis 
first  the fair value of roxio will be compared to its net book value 
if the fair value exceeds the net book value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of our goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
because our market capitalization from the date of legal separation through march   exceeded our net book value  we have determined that goodwill is not impaired 
product development costs 
costs for the development of new software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional development costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
for all software development projects to date  management has determined that under roxio s current software development process  the product is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions  not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues year ended march  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation charges write off of acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income tax provision for income tax net income comparison of years ended march   and net revenues net revenues include revenues from licensing and sales of our software  reduced by estimated product returns and pricing adjustments 
we recognize licensing revenues from oems based on reported product shipments by oems  provided all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from sales to distributors upon shipment by us or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collection is probable 
we provide for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
our distributor agreements generally provide distributors with stock rotation and price protection rights as well as the right to return discontinued products 
we recognize revenues from direct product sales to end users upon shipment by us 
net revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  
net revenues increased during fiscal as compared to an increase of during fiscal the increase in fiscal was largely driven by higher distributor sales of our easy cd creator  which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the acquisition of mgi software in fiscal also contributed additional net revenues of million in fiscal in both fiscal years  worldwide growth in shipments to oems continued 
however  average per unit license fee reductions partially offset higher unit volume shipments to oems in fiscal and completely offset higher unit volume shipments in fiscal in fiscal  the growth in net revenues also resulted from our release of easy cd creator in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the release of easy cd creator in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents gross margin gross margin is the percentage of profit from net revenues after deducting cost of revenues  which includes costs related to the physical goods shipped  third party licensed intellectual property  freight  warranty  end user technical support  scrap and manufacturing variances 
our gross margin from oem revenues is generally significantly higher than our gross margin from distributor revenues primarily due to product costs and to a lesser extent due to a different level of product support effort associated with oem sales compared to distributor sales 
for sales of our products through oems  the oems are responsible for the first level of product support and we only provide a second level of support to the oem 
we expect gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the relative mix of oem and distributor revenues 
additionally  over time  our overall gross margin may decline somewhat as the relative percentage of net revenues derived from distributor sales increases if we are unable to offset margin reductions through less expensive distribution  packaging and support costs 
gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and of net revenues in fiscal in fiscal  the change in our revenue mix toward a higher percentage of distributor revenues resulted in increased production costs and accounted for a decrease of approximately two percentage points in gross margin 
this was substantially offset by a reduction in technical support costs  primarily in the first half of fiscal technical support costs vary from period to period based on the timing of new releases of products and operating systems 
while gross margins on mgi software products are slightly higher than our other products  this did not have a significant impact on overall gross margins in fiscal because mgi software was included in our consolidated results of operations for only two months of fiscal in the future  we expect that our costs will increase  and gross margins will decrease accordingly  as distributor and direct sales revenues become a larger proportion of our revenues and technical support costs increase to support new product lines and new releases of existing products 
operating expenses we classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions 
to date  all software product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our operating expenses have increased following our separation from adaptec as we developed an infrastructure to support our level of business activity  built a corporate brand identity separate from adaptec and promoted our products  added personnel and created incentive programs with our distribution partners 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses increased during fiscal as compared to an increase of during fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in both fiscal and fiscal  the increase was primarily due to additional personnel and consultants to support increased development efforts for both cd and dvd recordable software products 
research and development headcount increased from at march  to at march  and at march  in fiscal  the increase was also driven by additional spending to develop and maintain the versions of our cd recording software included in our strategic relationship offerings 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to invest in product development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal as compared to an increase of during fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net 
table of contents revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in both fiscal years  approximately two thirds of the increase in absolute dollars resulted from higher advertising and promotion expenses related to building our product brands 
the remainder of the increase related to higher staffing levels as we expanded our sales and marketing team to pursue revenue generating opportunities 
sales and marketing headcount increased from at march  to at march  and at march  
in addition  the integration of mgi software added approximately  to sales and marketing expenses in fiscal we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we intend to invest in marketing and advertising focused on building our corporate identity and to continue our current efforts to build our product brands 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal as compared to an increase of during fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expense for both fiscal years resulted primarily from payroll and other related costs associated with establishing a senior management team and dedicated human resources  information technology and finance support for us to operate as a stand alone entity 
general and administrative headcount increased from at march  to at march  and at march  in fiscal  the integration of mgi software added approximately  to general and administrative expenses 
in addition  in fiscal  we incurred additional costs related to the integration of wild file in minnesota 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we accommodate our growth  add related infrastructure and incur expenses related to being a public company 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal this expense represented of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal and  this expense consisted of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of cequadrat and wild file 
we elected to early adopt sfas no 
effective april   and accordingly  we ceased to amortize goodwill on that date 
the reduction in amortization expense in fiscal is due to the adoption of sfas no 
partially offset by  of amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of mgi software in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effect of the adoption of sfas no stock based compensation charges 
stock based compensation charges relate to the amortization of costs associated with the assumption of restricted stock from the wild file acquisition  stock and warrants issued to virgin  stock options issued to employees  and the commitment of roxio stock options to adaptec employees who became roxio employees 
stock based compensation charges were  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal stock based compensation charges increased in fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  stock based compensation charges increased more than times over fiscal this expense represented less than one percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million related to the issuance of stock option grants to roxio employees at exercise prices below fair market value at the date of grant and the remeasurement of stock options granted to adaptec employees who became roxio employees upon legal separation 
amortization related to these stock options totaled million in fiscal in fiscal  we also recorded  of non cash charges associated with stock option commitments made in the third quarter of fiscal to adaptec employees who were projected to become roxio employees upon legal separation 
in addition  in fiscal  we issued common stock and a warrant to virgin and recorded amortization of stock based compensation of million in connection with this transaction 
in fiscal  we recorded million in non cash charges associated with 
table of contents stock option commitments made in the third quarter of fiscal to adaptec employees who were projected to become roxio employees upon legal separation 
in fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation charges related to the assumption of restricted stock as part of the wild file acquisition in the fourth quarter of the amortization of these non cash charges totaled million in fiscal and  in fiscal write off of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of mgi software in january  we wrote off million related to in process research and development 
in fiscal  in connection with our acquisitions of cequadrat and wild file  we incurred write offs of acquired in process technology of million for cequadrat and  for wild file 
since the net tangible liabilities  excluding cash acquired  related to the fiscal acquisitions were assumed to have been contributed to us by adaptec  the write offs of acquired in process technology are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
other income  net in fiscal  other income  net  consists of primarily of interest income on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
prior to fiscal  we did not have cash equivalents and short term investments as adaptec managed cash on a centralized basis 
accordingly  we did not record any interest income prior to fiscal provision for income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our effective income tax rates were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of in fiscal primarily due to stock based compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes and in fiscal primarily due to non deductible acquisition charges and stock based compensation 
in fiscal and fiscal  our operating results were included in adaptec s consolidated united states federal and state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes in our financial statements for those years has been determined on a separate return basis 
prior to our separation from adaptec  roxio benefited from an advantageous tax rate system in singapore  which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for fiscal we are subject to tax in jurisdictions in which we operate around the world 
our future effective tax rate will be impacted by our organizational structure and the geographic distribution of our worldwide revenue and profitability 
as a result of these factors  our effective tax rate may vary in the future 
liquidity and capital resources prior to legal separation  adaptec managed cash on a centralized basis 
adaptec collected cash receipts associated with our business and provided us funding to cover our disbursements 
accordingly  we have reported no cash or cash equivalents prior to legal separation on may  as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating cash flows in fiscal primarily reflected net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation charges of 
table of contents million  the write off of acquired in process research and development of million  and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million 
operating cash flows in fiscal primarily reflected net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation charges of million  and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
fiscal operation cash flows primarily reflected net income of million  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization and million for the write off of acquired in process research and development  and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  million was used to purchase capital equipment  million was used to purchase short term investments and  was added to capitalized web site development costs 
we also used million in our acquisition of mgi software  net of cash acquired of million 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million and million in capitalized web site development costs 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal consisted of capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and related to returns of capital to adaptec 
any other cash receipts or disbursements from to adaptec related to operating activities and were classified as such in the cash flow statement and the discussion above 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily from the transfer of million in net cash from adaptec to fund our operations as a stand alone entity 
this amount consisted of million transferred to us on the date of legal separation net of million transferred by us to adaptec prior to legal separation 
in addition  we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan totaling million and proceeds from the sale of our common stock to a strategic partner of million 
our major commitments relate to payments for operating leases related to our facilities and capital leases related to equipment 
at march   future commitments under operating leases totaled million  payable through  and future commitments under capital leases totaled million  payable through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  we entered into an agreement with a bank to provide a million revolving line of credit  collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the line of credit bears interest either at a fixed rate of libor plus per annum or at a variable rate of prime plus per annum and expires in january the line of credit contains certain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit at march  on may   the date of legal separation  adaptec contributed million in cash to us  including million in cash held by our overseas subsidiaries 
the contribution was non reciprocal and we will not repay any of this amount 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  including the cash received from this contribution upon legal separation  together with cash flows from future operating results and access to funds under our revolving line of credit will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  any material acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies or material joint venture could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if sufficient funds are not available  we may not be able to introduce new products or compete effectively in any of our markets  either of which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future 
if we are unable to generate positive cash flow from operations  we may be required to obtain additional financing from other sources 

table of contents generally  payment terms from our customers do not exceed days  while our liabilities with vendors are due from zero to days following the invoice date 
generally  payments of receivables by our customers to us are not contingent upon resale and we have not experienced payment delays due to product disputes 
mgi software  which we acquired in january  has experienced significant collection difficulties in the past 
while we are working to resolve these problems  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
we have never held derivative financial instruments  nor had debt outstanding at any time 
accordingly  we have not been exposed to near term adverse changes in interest rates or other market prices 
we may  however  experience such adverse changes if we incur debt or hold derivative financial instruments in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with three high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  all of our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk 
maturing in less than one year more than one year total estimated fair value dollars in thousands short term investments weighted average interest rate we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
while we have available to us a revolving line of credit that may have a variable interest rate  there are no amounts currently outstanding under the line of credit and we do not currently hold any other variable interest rate debt 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
exchange rate risk we develop our software in the united states  canada and europe and sell it in north america  europe  the pacific rim and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period 
exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign entity financial statements are included as a component of other comprehensive income 

table of contents for foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar  certain assets and liabilities are re measured at the period end or historical rates as appropriate 
revenues and expenses are re measured at the average rate during the period 
currency translation gains and losses are recognized in current operations and have not been material to our operating results in the periods presented 
we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers and distributors throughout the world 
prior to legal separation from adaptec  sales to customers and cash and cash equivalents were primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  since legal separation  we have been transitioning the sales of our international subsidiaries to euro and japanese yen 
to date  foreign exchange gains and losses from these sales have not been material to our operations 
cash and cash equivalents are predominantly denominated in us dollars
