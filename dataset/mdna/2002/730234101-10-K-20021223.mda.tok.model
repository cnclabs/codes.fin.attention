general the company s net income is primarily affected by its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities  and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  including fhlb advances 
the company s net income also is affected by its provisions for losses on loans and investments in real estate  as well as the amount of noninterest income including fees and service charges and gains or losses on sales of loans  and noninterest expense  including salaries and employee benefits  premises and equipment expense  data processing expense  and income taxes 
net income of the company also is affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
market risk analysis general 
it is the objective of the company to minimize  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate spread is the difference between the company s yield on its interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is generally understood to be the sensitivity of the company s earnings  net asset values  and stockholders equity to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the company s earnings 
the effect on earnings of changes in interest rates generally depends on how quickly the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities react to the changes in market rates of interest 
if the company s cost of deposit accounts reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the yield on the company s mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings 
on the other hand  if the company s yield on its mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the company s cost of deposit accounts  then an increasing rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings 
net portfolio value 
the value of the company s loan and investment portfolio will change as interest rates change 
rising interest rates will generally decrease the company s net portfolio value npv  while falling interest rates will generally increase the value of that portfolio 
the following table set forth  quantitatively  as of september   the ots estimate of the projected changes in npv in the event of a   and basis point instantaneous and permanent increase and a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current low prevailing interest rate environment  the changes in npv is not estimated for a decrease in interest rates of or basis points 
change in change in npv interest rates as a percentage of in basis points net portfolio value estimated market rate shock amount change change ratio value of assets dollars in thousands computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are calculated by the ots from data provided by the company and are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit runoffs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their effect on the company s npv in the future 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent the company s primary loan product  have features that restrict changes in interest rates during the initial term and over the remaining life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the company s portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market rates decrease 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
