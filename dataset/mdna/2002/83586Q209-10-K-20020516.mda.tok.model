meret optical communications during the periods prior to january   meret was an integral portion of the optical networking business unit which also included sorrento 
as of january   we separated meret from the optical networking business segment 
for periods prior to january   amounts reported for the meret segment of our business may not be indicative of the results of operations that would have resulted had meret been operated as a stand alone entity

engineering  research and development 
meret incurred engineering expenses during fiscal of  no engineering expenses were incurred during the fiscal year ended january  after meret s separation from the optical networking segment  we increased engineering expenditures to update older products and we will continue to increase engineering spending in the future to support existing as well as new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of net sales during fiscal from  or of net sales for the same comparable period last year 
after meret s separation from the optical networking segment  the need for general and administrative operations was minimal 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations through a combination of internal funds  investments and debt and equity financing 
at january   our working capital was million including million of investments in marketable securities and million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  million of series a holder s obligation as a result of their exercised right of redemption has been re classified at year end january   as a current liability as compared to mezzanine in the company s liability and owner s equity 
the series a liability can only be paid through lawfully available funds that would normally be generated from sni profitable operations  which the company does not currently have available or foresee availability in the near future 
the amounts included in our statement of cash flows for fiscal are not comparable to our fiscal amounts due to the inclusion of entrada and netsilicon for less than a full year 
readers should refer to entrada s netsilicon s annual reports on form k for information concerning entrada and netsilicon 
our operations used cash flows of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal wherein the company incurred a cash flow deficit of million from continuing operations 
the decrease in cash flows used by operations in fiscal was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable  combined with the increase in reserves for inventory and accounts receivable  the use of stock for the payment of interest on debentures and the loss on sale of marketable securities 
this favorable impact on cash used for operations was partially offset by the negative cash impact of the company s larger net operating loss and the use of cash to decrease our accounts payable 
in addition to the foregoing there were less significant changes associated with changes in amortization and depreciation and other current liabilities 
the company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations for the past two years 
sorrento networks  inc  the company s principal operating subsidiary has primarily been the operating entity responsible for these high losses and negative cash flows 
the losses have been generated as sni continues to develop its technology  marketing and sales and operations in its effort to become a major supplier of metro and regional optical networks world wide 
the company has funded its operations primarily by the sale of securities and the issuance of debt 
there can be no assurance that similar funding will be available in the future 
further  with the downturn in the economic environment and decreases in capital spending by telecom carriers  the company anticipates that its current and future revenues will be negatively impacted 
as a result  the company will need to either raise additional capital in the future or substantially decrease its operating costs and capital spending in order to fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that our available cash  future funding or reduction in operating costs will be sufficient to fund our operations in the future 
our standard payment terms range from net to net days 
receivables from international customers have frequently taken longer to collect 
for some of the customers of our optical networking products payment is required within days from the date of shipment 
in addition  the downturn in the telecom market has impacted many of the telecom carriers ability to purchase or pay for outstanding commitments within standard payment terms 
there can be no assurance that either current or future receivables will not be impacted negatively by this economic environment 
we do not provide long term financing to customers buying our equipment  however  we did provide long term equipment financing to an optical networking customer during fiscal and the purchase agreement with this customer provides for invoiced installation and other deployment expenses not to exceed of the equipment cost 
the terms of this financing provide that the customer may convert any balances outstanding longer than days into a level payment month term note at per annum interest 
we financed million of receivables  including deployment expenses  during fiscal for this customer 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we exchanged million of the then unpaid balance shares of the customer s convertible preferred stock  an approximately interest on a fully diluted basis 
the remaining balance of the note and accrued interest of  was paid in cash 
during fiscal we made sales of million and reimbursed deployment expenses of  to this customer 
in november  we sold all our shares of our investment in one of sorrento s customers for million and  in accumulated  unpaid dividends 
of the total million due from the purchaser  approximately or  was held in a segregated escrow account for one year 
the gain of million on the sale of the shares is included in investment income in the accompanying income statement in fiscal during fiscals and we made sales of million and million respectively  to this customer under a long term equipment financing agreement 
the purchase agreement with this customer provides for invoiced installation and other deployment expenses not to exceed of the equipment cost 
the terms of the financing agreement provide that the customer may convert any balances outstanding longer than days into a level month term note at per annum interest 
we financed million  including deployment expenses of  during fiscal for this customer which was paid in full including accrued interest during january we financed million of receivables  including deployment expenses of  during fiscal for this customer and million of the then unpaid note was exchanged for our equity interest in the customer 
the remaining balance of the note and accrued interest of  was paid in cash 
our investing activities during fiscal used cash flows of million 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal year included purchases of property and equipment of million and  in purchases of other assets 
this was offset by  of cash received from the sale of marketable securities and other investments 
in fiscal used cash flows in investing activities of million including million in cash balances at entrada as of august  when it ceased to be a subsidiary  following the merger with sync research 
we purchased property and equipment of million  invested million in entrada and million in one of sorrento s customers 
during fiscal  we received million from the sale of  of our nsi shares and  from the purchasers of our discontinued operations 
we received million offset by our investment of million from the investment in one of sorrento s customers and payment of million on a note receivable 
our financing activities during fiscal provided the company million and consisted primarily of financing activities from the sale of common stock in march  of  shares which generated proceeds of million and a convertible debenture financing in august  which raised million 
in addition to the sale of common stock and convertible debentures  the company received million from proceeds of stock option and warrant exercises of 
million and long term debt of 
million 
offsetting these amounts were repayments of short term and long term debt of 
million 
in fiscal the company provided cash flows of million which consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from a private placement by sorrento of its convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from a private placement by entrada of its common stock  million in proceeds from option and warrant exercises  million in proceeds from long term debt offset by repayments of short and long term debt 
the financing activities of continuing operations during fiscal provided cash flows of million which consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from a private placement of our common stock  and million in proceeds from option and warrant exercises offset by preferred stock dividends paid in cash and treasury stock purchases 
we have a line of credit which totals million which was reduced to million subsequent to january  outstanding borrowings against this lines of credit were million at january  our credit line is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
during fiscal we completed one sale of our common stock receiving net proceeds of million and issued  shares of our common stock in conversions of preferred stock issued in prior years 
at january  the liquidation preference of the outstanding preferred stock is million and none of the shares are currently convertible 
see notes i and j to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii herein 
during march  our sorrento subsidiary completed a private placement of  shares of its series a convertible preferred stock to a group of investors receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
each share of our sorrento subsidiary s series a preferred stock is convertible into one share of its common stock at the option of the holder may vote on an as converted basis except for election of directors  and has a liquidation preference of per share 
the shares are automatically converted into sorrento s common stock upon an underwritten public offering by sorrento with an aggregate offering price of at least million 
since sorrento did not complete a million public offering by march   the holders of more than of the then outstanding series a shares may request to be redeemed at the shares then adjusted liquidation preference 
in april  a majority of series a shareholders exercised their right to redeem the series a preferred stock 
such request can only be made out of funds deemed to be lawfully available or for sale pro rata portion as to which a lesser amount of lawfull available funds would exist 
the company at the current time does not have such funds which would normally be generated from operating profits of the subsidiary  sorrento networks  inc on august   we completed a merger of entrada with sync research  inc  a nasdaq listed company in which we received  shares of the merged entity which changed its name to entrada networks  inc and changed its symbol to esan 
we purchased  shares of sync in the open market during june and july  for and on august  purchased an additional  shares directly from entrada for  after these transactions we owned of entrada networks and we have accounted for our interest on our balance sheet at cost as of january  on december   we distributed  of our entrada shares to our shareholders of record as of november  the distribution was made at the rate of one fourth of an entrada share for each of our outstanding shares 
at exercise  options and warrants to acquire our common shares which were granted and unexercised as of november  will receive a similar number of entrada shares 
prior to january  we distributed  of our entrada shares upon the exercise of options and as of january  have reserved  shares for future exercises of options and warrants 
the cost basis of these reserved shares and related liability to the option and warrant holders is included in the investment in former subsidiary and dividends payable in the accompanying balance sheet 
the aggregate distribution of our entrada shares including the shares reserved for option and warrant holders has been accounted for at our original cost of  in addition we have granted options to purchase  of our entrada shares for per share the merger price to several of our then officers and consultants 
we anticipate that our available cash resources  and marketable securities available for sale together with any necessary cost reductions will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital requirements for the next year 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned including the need for additional working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
there can be no assurances that our working capital requirements will not exceed our ability to generate sufficient cash internally to support our requirements and that external financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our valuation of inventory and our allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o inventory is evaluated on a continual basis and reserve adjustments are made based on management s estimate of future sales value  if any  of specific inventory items 
reserve adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value and charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
o accounts receivable balances are evaluated on a continual basis and allowances are provided for potentially uncollectable accounts based on management s estimate of the collectability of customer accounts 
if the financial condition of a customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance may be required 
allowance adjustments are charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
effects of inflation and currency exchange rates we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results or on the prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
the majority of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in us dollars and to date our business has not been significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
however  we conduct business in several different countries and thus fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive in particular countries  leading to a reduction in sales in that country 
in addition  inflation in such countries could increase our expenses 
in the future  we may engage in foreign currency denominated sales or pay material amounts of expenses in foreign currencies and  in such event  may experience gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
restatement of previously issued annual financial statements is not permitted  however  comparative financial information for earlier periods shall reflect required reclassifications in presentation 
sfas requires long lived assets of continuing and discontinued operations be measured at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs 
the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations shall be presented separately in the asset and liability sections of the balance rather than shown as net realizable value 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires the recognition of the fair value of liabilities for asset retirement obligations to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect  if any  on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  upon adoption of sfas  it requires that we reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that we identify reporting units for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test nine months from the date of adoption 
we are also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas other matters see item legal proceedings contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk is the result of our need for periodic additional financing for our large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our operations 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on debt financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt 
additionally  the interest rates charged by our present lenders adjust on the basis of the lenders prime rate 
almost all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
a portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and in the future a larger portion of our sales could also be denominated in non us currencies 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the non us dollar and the currencies in which we do business could cause foreign currency translation gains or losses that we would recognize in the period incurred 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we attempt to minimize our currency exposure risk through working capital management and do not hedge our exposure to translation gains and losses related to foreign currency net asset exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
investments held for other than trading purposes do not impose a material market risk 
we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years and the relatively stable interest rates incurred on short term financing have not had a significant impact on our sales  operating results or prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation or an upward trend in short term interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future should we require debt financing in the future
