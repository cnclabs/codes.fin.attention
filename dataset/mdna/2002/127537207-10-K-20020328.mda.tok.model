item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the consolidated financial statements set forth herein for each of the three years in the period ended december   reflect the results of our operations and the operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries including sun world 
page a summary of the sun world elements which our management believes is essential to an analysis of the results of operations for such periods is presented below 
for purposes of this summary  the term sun world will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to the operations and activities of our sun world subsidiary  and the term cadiz will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to our operations and activities that do not involve sun world 
our net income or loss in future fiscal periods will be largely reflective of a the operations of our water development activities including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program and b the operations of sun world including its international expansion 
sun world conducts its operations through four operating divisions farming  packing  marketing and proprietary product development 
net income from farming operations varies from year to year primarily due to yield and pricing fluctuations which can be significantly influenced by weather conditions  and are  therefore  generally subject to greater annual variation than sun world s other divisions 
however  the geographic distribution of sun world s farming operations within california and the diversity of its crop mix makes it unlikely that adverse weather conditions would affect all of sun world s properties or all of its crops in any single year 
nevertheless  net profit from sun world s packing  marketing and proprietary product development operations tends to be more consistent from year to year than net profit from sun world s farming operations 
packing and marketing revenues from third party growers currently represent less than of our total revenues 
sun world has entered into agreements domestically and internationally to license selected proprietary fruit varieties and continues to pursue additional domestic and international licensing opportunities 
license revenues currently represent less than of our total revenues 
a year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our agricultural operations are impacted by the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 
sun world has historically received the majority of its net income during the months of june to october following the harvest and sale of its table grape and stonefruit crops 
due to this concentrated activity  sun world has  therefore  historically incurred a loss with respect to its agricultural operations in the other months during the year 
page the table below sets forth  for the periods indicated  the results of operations for sun world s four main divisions before elimination of any interdivisional charges  as well as the categories of costs and expenses we incurred which are not included within the divisional results in thousands year ended december  divisional net income loss farming   packing   marketing   proprietary product development   general and administrative   special litigation  removal of underperforming crops  non recurring compensation expense  depreciation and amortization   interest expense  net   income tax expense net loss   farming operations 
net loss from farming operations totaled million for compared to a net profit of million in farming revenues were million and farming expenses were million for for  sun world had farming revenues of million and farming expenses of million 
farming results were negatively impacted by a two week weather related delay in the table grape harvest in coachella and mexico  which created an overlap with the early table grape harvests in the san joaquin valley 
this overlap created downward pressure on fob prices for table grapes that continued through the entire san joaquin valley harvest 
year to date fob prices for table grapes were below farming results 
additionally  sun world experienced lower table grape yields as it sold million boxes during compared to million boxes during results were also negatively impacted in compared to due to decreased prices for wine grapes  peppers and plums 
average fob prices for wine grapes and peppers were down due to oversupply in the industry by and  respectively  compared to profits for plums were down due to lower yields coupled with smaller sized fruit resulting from adverse weather 
sun world sold million boxes of plums in compared to million boxes in fob prices for plums were below prices 
citrus results were million higher than due to an increase in production yields coupled with a increase in fob prices 
the decrease in farming expenses is primarily due to the removal of certain underperforming stonefruit and wine grape acreage at the conclusion of the growing season and the reduction and elimination of certain row crop acreage in for crops that had become unprofitable 
sun world s proprietary table grape and stonefruit products have allowed sun world to continue to command price premiums to the overall market 
packing operations 
sun world s packing and handling facilities contributed million in profit during compared to million in the aggregate packing and handling revenue for these operations of million was offset by million of expenses for revenues totaled million offset by expenses of million for sun page world packed million units during and moved an additional million units through the cold storage facilities for a total of million units processed through the packing operations in compared to million units in this decrease in units is due primarily to lower sun world grown table grape and plum yields as well as fewer units of third party citrus partially offset by increased units of third party table grapes 
the increase in profits is due to increased profits per unit resulting from a price increase in storage and handling revenues for table grapes  stonefruit and peppers that was implemented in to offset increased energy and labor costs 
units packed and handled during consisted primarily of sun world grown table grapes  peppers and seedless watermelons in the coachella valley  table grapes and citrus products packed for third party growers  and sun world grown table grapes  stonefruit  citrus  and peppers from the san joaquin valley 
marketing operations 
during  a total of million units were sold consisting primarily of sun world grown table grapes  peppers and watermelons from the coachella valley  table grapes and citrus from domestic third party growers  and sun world grown table grapes  stonefruit  citrus  and peppers from the san joaquin valley 
these unit sales resulted in marketing revenue of million 
marketing expenses totaled million for resulting in net income from marketing operations of million 
during  million units were sold resulting in revenues of million offset by expenses of million for net income of million 
the decrease in revenues  marketing profits and units sold is primarily due to lower fob prices for table grapes  plums and peppers  decreased units of sun world grown table grapes and plums  and the elimination of certain underperforming stonefruit and row crops from production in proprietary product development 
sun world has a long history of product innovation  and its research and development center maintains a fruit breeding program that has introduced dozens of proprietary fruit varieties 
additionally  sun world continues to expand its licensing program with key strategic partners worldwide to introduce  trial and produce sun world s proprietary varieties  which provides sun world with a long term annual revenue stream based upon a royalty fee for each box of proprietary fruit sold during the life of the tree or vine 
during  net income from proprietary product development was million consisting of revenues of million offset by expenses of million 
for  net income was million consisting of revenues of million offset by expenses of million 
the decrease in proprietary product development net income is primarily due to decreased intercompany royalties due to lighter yields  additional costs associated with the expansion of sun world s licensing distribution structure  and a timing difference for international royalties due to harvest delays in south africa 
revenues include million related to project development and management fees payable in equity of kadco for both and during  sun world expanded its acreage under license with its strategic partners by to over  acres 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for and special litigation 
we were engaged in lawsuits against waste management seeking monetary damages arising from activities adverse to us in connection with a landfill  which until its defeat by the voters of san bernardino county in  was proposed to be located adjacent to our cadiz fenner valley properties 
in march  we executed a settlement agreement with waste management related to these lawsuits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  waste management paid cadiz million in cash and granted to cadiz an exclusive option to receive  at no cost to cadiz  up to approximately  acres of real property in eastern san bernardino county primarily adjacent to the cadiz program property 
in april  we page exercised the option and as a consequence acquired the subject property 
the settlement resulted in net proceeds of million for during  expenses including litigation costs and professional fees related to this matter totaled million 
non recurring compensation 
in march  we issued  deferred stock units to certain senior managers of cadiz and sun world 
these deferred stock units were issued in exchange for the cancellation of  fully vested options to purchase our common stock held by the senior managers 
the number of the deferred stock units issued was calculated based on the average closing price for the business days following the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  on march  we recorded a one time charge of  and no cash was expended in connection with the issuance of the deferred stock units 
removal of underperforming crops 
during  management decided to remove approximately acres of citrus at the cadiz ranch and sun world removed approximately acres of wine grapes  citrus  and stonefruit 
we recorded a charge of million in connection with the removal of these crops 
in december  we recorded a million charge to remove certain underperforming crops  primarily acres of wine grapes and stonefruit 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to certain assets being sold or removed in and other assets becoming fully depreciated

net income from farming operations totaled million for compared to million in farming revenues were million and farming expenses were million for for  we had farming revenues of million and farming expenses of million 
the decrease in farming results in compared to were primarily due to decreased prices on table grapes  wine grapes  stonefruit and citrus due to an oversupply of products in the industry 
average fob prices for were down 
the increase in farming expenses is primarily due to costs to grow and harvest citrus in the san joaquin valley in that were not incurred in due to the december freeze 
sun world s proprietary table grape and stonefruit products have allowed sun world to continue to command a price premium to the overall market that helped offset some of the losses incurred from its commodity products 
packing operations 
sun world s packing and handling facilities contributed million in profit during compared to million in we packed million units and moved an additional million units through the cold storage facilities for a total of million units processed through the packing operations in compared to the same total of million units in packing results were negatively impacted by a significant increase in corrugated box costs and temporary use of third party storage facilities during july due to capacity constraints

financing costs  which include legal fees  loan fees and warrants  are amortized over the life of the debt agreement 
liquidity and capital resources a current financing arrangements cadiz obligations 
as cadiz has not received significant revenues from our water resource activity to date  cadiz has been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  cadiz has addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements with our lenders  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   we were obligated for approximately million under a senior term loan facility and million under a million revolving credit facility with the same lender 
in the first quarter of  we completed an extension of both facilities to a maturity date of january  and increased cadiz revolving credit facility to million 
million of cadiz revolving credit facility is convertible into  shares of our stock any time prior to january at the election of the lender 
currently  the lender holds a senior deed of trust on substantially all of our non sun world assets under the term loan facility and a second lien on our non sun world assets under cadiz revolving credit facility 
we have historically structured our financing arrangement with the lender with a view toward effective implementation of the cadiz program 
while we currently anticipate repayment of these facilities with monies to be received under the cadiz program  we may  if we deem appropriate  replace or renegotiate the terms of these facilities to accommodate other developments such as delays in the timetable for regulatory approvals or litigation related to regulatory approvals of the cadiz program 
we retain the right to maintain million of senior debt secured by the cadiz program area lands pursuant to the definitive economic terms for the cadiz program agreed with metropolitan  as described under outlook below 
in december  we issued million of series d convertible preferred stock 
the stock is convertible into  shares of our common stock any time prior to july at the election of the holder 
we also have the right to convert the preferred stock  but only when the closing price of our common stock has exceeded per share for consecutive trading days 
the preferred stock will be redeemed in july if it is still outstanding 
in october and november  we issued an aggregate of million of series e and e convertible preferred stock in million issuances respectively 
the series e and e preferred stock is convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at any time prior to july at the election of the holder 
we also have the right to convert the series e and e preferred stock  but only when the closing price of our common stock has exceeded per share for consecutive trading days 
the preferred stock will be redeemed in july if still outstanding 
as we continue to actively pursue our business strategy  additional financing specifically in connection with our water programs will be required 
responsibility for funding the design  construction and program implementation costs of the capital facilities for the cadiz program will  under currently developed principles and terms  be shared equally by cadiz and page metropolitan 
we plan to use monies to be received from metropolitan for its initial payment for  acre feet of groundwater storage as well as long term financing arrangements currently under negotiation  to fund cadiz share of the estimated million cost of the program capital facilities 
sun world obligations 
under sun world s historical working capital cycle  working capital is required primarily to finance the costs of growing and harvesting crops  which generally occur from january through september with a peak need in june 
sun world harvests and sells the majority of its crops during the period from june through october  when it receives the majority of its revenues 
in order to bridge the gap between incurrence of expenditures and receipt of revenues  large cash outlays are required each year which are financed through a million revolving credit agreement guaranteed by cadiz 
in november  sun world renewed its revolving credit facility through the growing season with a maturity date of november amounts eligible to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility are based upon a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
maximum availability under the revolving credit facility varies throughout the year with a maximum of million available during the peak borrowing periods of april to july 
the revolving credit facility is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and the proceeds thereof  requires sun world to meet certain financial covenants  and is guaranteed by cadiz 
amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at either prime plus or libor plus at our election 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  in addition  sun world has outstanding million of first mortgage notes which will mature on april  and are publicly traded and registered under the securities act of the sun world notes became redeemable at the option of sun world  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  interest accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually on april th and october th of each year 
the sun world notes are secured by a first lien subject to certain permitted liens on substantially all of the assets of sun world and its subsidiaries  other than growing crops  crop inventories and accounts receivable and proceeds thereof  which secure sun world s revolving credit facility  and certain real property pledged to third parties 
the sun world notes are also secured by the guarantee of cadiz and the pledge by cadiz of all of the stock of sun world 
the sun world notes include covenants that do not allow for the payment of dividends by us or by sun world other than out of cumulative net income 
cash used for operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to cash used for operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to the million of cash received as part of the special litigation recovery in coupled with higher accounts payable balances at december  cash used for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the increase is cash used was primarily due to reduced sales of property  plant and equipment  and the non reoccurrence of a million final partnership distribution in  partially offset by decreased expenditures for developing crops

specifically  in april  cadiz and metropolitan approved definitive economic terms and responsibilities for a year agreement for the cadiz program 
under the cadiz program  metropolitan will  during wet years or periods of excess supply  store surplus water from the colorado river aqueduct in the groundwater basin underlying our property 
during dry years or times of reduced allocations from the colorado river  the previously imported water  together with additional existing groundwater  will be extracted and delivered  via a conveyance pipeline  back to the aqueduct 
the definitive terms will serve as the basis for a final agreement to be executed between metropolitan and cadiz 
execution of this final agreement will be subject to completion of the ongoing environmental review process for the cadiz program 
key provisions of the approved definitive terms for the cadiz program are as follows over the year term of the agreement  metropolitan will store a minimum of  acre feet of colorado river aqueduct water in our groundwater basin and purchase up to a minimum of  acre feet of existing groundwater for transfer during dry years 
the cadiz program will have the capacity to convey  either for storage or transfer  up to approximately  acre feet in any given year 
during storage operations  metropolitan will pay per acre foot for put of colorado river water into storage and per acre foot for return of colorado river water from storage  or a total of per acre foot to cycle water into and out of the basin 
these fees will be adjusted by the consumer price index cpi 
as outlined above  metropolitan s total minimum commitment for storage is  acre feet 
metropolitan will pay for the initial  acre feet of put and take activity upon final contract execution and completion of the environmental review process million before cpi adjustment 
metropolitan will pay for an additional  acre feet of put and take activity at the earlier of actual usage or  acre foot annual increments during years of cadiz program operations  per year before cpi adjustment 
for transfer operations  metropolitan shall purchase  acre feet per year of indigenous groundwater for years at a per acre foot transfer fee  subject to a fair market value adjustment as described below 
in addition  cadiz may elect to either sell up to an additional  acre feet per year of indigenous groundwater to third parties in metropolitan s service area at fair market value  or require metropolitan to purchase that amount of water at a fixed transfer fee of per acre foot 
accordingly  metropolitan s total potential minimum commitment for the life of the cadiz program will be  acre feet of indigenous groundwater 
all transfers of indigenous groundwater  whether to metropolitan or third parties  will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of a groundwater monitoring and management plan 
page the transfer fee will reflect a fair market value adjustment  which shall be determined up to once a year 
the transfer fee will be adjusted by one half of any increase or decrease in the fair market value  above or below the transfer fee currently in place per acre foot initially 
each increase or decrease in the transfer fee paid by metropolitan may not exceed 
for example  if the fair market value at the first redetermination is per acre foot  then the adjusted transfer fee shall be 
the lesser of a per acre foot or b per acre foot 
our right to sell to third parties within metropolitan s service area includes scheduled access to metropolitan s system at the rate charged by metropolitan for conveying water through its aqueduct and pipeline system the wheeling rate charged for as available capacity  plus power costs and any standard water stewardship fee that is uniformly charged to metropolitan member agencies or third parties 
depending on availability of system capacity  metropolitan may elect to exchange other water for delivery to our customers and bank the water we have sold 
if indigenous water supplies are determined to exceed  acre feet  metropolitan shall have the first right of refusal to purchase one half of that excess yield 
cadiz groundwater meets all existing federal and state water quality standards 
metropolitan s colorado river aqueduct water meets all existing federal and state water quality standards 
metropolitan shall be responsible to ensure  at its expense  that colorado river aqueduct water introduced into our groundwater basin shall  at a minimum  meet all existing and potential future federal and state water quality standards applicable to the colorado river aqueduct 
we shall be responsible to ensure  at our expense  that indigenous groundwater introduced into the metropolitan delivery system shall at a minimum  meet all existing and potential future federal and state water quality standards 
if both indigenous groundwater and stored colorado river water exceed any future federal or state water quality standard  then the parties will share compliance with the new standard based pro rata on the contribution to exceeding the standard 
the cadiz program facilities  including spreading basins  extraction wells  conveyance pipeline and a pumping plant are estimated to cost approximately million  and both parties will equally share these costs 
each party will be responsible for financing its portion of the capital costs 
metropolitan will be responsible for operational costs of the cadiz program 
however  we will assume pro rata operational costs associated with the sale of indigenous groundwater to third parties 
we and metropolitan shall share equally the capital costs required for mitigation at the outset of the cadiz program 
we shall assume the ongoing annual costs of operating the groundwater monitoring and management plan and of maintaining the right to withdraw water from the basin underlying the cadiz program area 
metropolitan and the us bureau of land management  in cooperation with the us geological survey and the national park service  issued the final environmental impact report environmental impact statement for the cadiz program in october issuance of page the environmental report is a significant milestone in the environmental review process as it represents the last step prior to final actions from the us bureau of land management and metropolitan 
we anticipate final actions related to the environmental review process to be completed by the end of the second quarter of after which construction of the cadiz program facilities may commence 
in addition to the development of our water resources  we are actively involved in further agricultural development and reinvestment in our landholdings 
such development will be systematic and in furtherance of our business strategy to provide for maximization of the value of our assets 
we also continually evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complimentary to our current portfolio of water and agricultural resources 
in january  we announced an agreement in principle with kadco to combine the businesses of sun world and kadco 
following the proposed combination  kadco s shareholders will have a interest in the combined business  and cadiz will retain an ownership interest of 
prior to the proposed combination  kadco expects to have cash resources in excess of million 
we intend to use the cash resources of the combined business both to recapitalize sun world and to provide for future business expansion 
the agreement in principle contemplates that  in the future  kadco shareholders will have an opportunity to make an additional equity investment in the combined business 
should kadco shareholders make this additional investment  we may choose to maintain a majority percentage ownership in the combined business through a proportionate matching investment 
we believe that additional investment will help position the combined business for its planned future transformation into a publicly traded company 
the proposed combination is subject to the negotiations of definitive agreements and a number of other important conditions 
see certain trends and uncertainties proposed combination of sun world with kadco below 
historically  sun world has serviced its indebtedness and met its seasonal working capital needs using available internal cash  its revolving credit facility and through an intercompany revolver with cadiz 
cadiz has met its ordinary working capital needs through a combination of available internal cash  quarterly management fee payments from sun world  payments from sun world under an agricultural lease whereby sun world now operates cadiz  acres of developed agricultural property at cadiz  california  cadiz revolving credit facility  the exercise of outstanding stock options  and equity placements 
except for the foregoing  additional intercompany cash payments between sun world and cadiz are subject to certain restrictions under their current lending arrangements 
we may require additional cash beyond the amounts described in this section although we are not looking to raise additional working capital at this time 
we may meet any such future requirements through a variety of means to be determined at the appropriate time 
such means may include equity or debt placements  or the sale or other disposition of assets 
equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders 
c certain trends and uncertainties in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
page we wish to caution readers that these factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any projected  estimated or forward looking statements relating to us 
the following factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by us or our representatives  including any forward looking discussion  as well as comments contained in press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  or other communications by us 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results  and are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes to discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  certain of these matters may have affected our past results and may affect future results 
risks inherent in agricultural operations 
we are subject to risks associated with our agricultural operations 
numerous factors can affect the price  yield and marketability of the crops grown on our properties 
crop prices may vary greatly from year to year as a result of the relationship between production and market demand 
for example  the production of a particular crop in excess of demand in any particular year will depress market prices  and inflationary factors and other unforeseeable economic changes may also  at the same time  increase operating costs with respect to such crops 
in addition  the agricultural industry in the united states is highly competitive  and domestic growers and produce marketers are facing increased competition from abroad  particularly from mexico 
there are also a number of factors outside of our control that could  alone or in combination  materially adversely affect our agricultural operations  such as adverse weather conditions  insects  blight or other diseases  labor problems such as boycotts or strikes and shortages of competent laborers 
our operations may also be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies including food safety and environmental regulations  social and economic conditions  and industry production levels 
proposed combination of sun world with kadco 
the proposed combination of sun world with kadco may not occur in the second quarter of  or at all  if various conditions are not met 
these conditions include final negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and a number of other conditions such as obtaining consents of governmental authorities and third parties with whom we have contracts  including lenders  completing a due diligence review of the other s operations  and kadco obtaining additional equity financing in order to complete the transaction 
risks of water development projects 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses from our non sun world operations until such time as we are able to receive significant revenues from the development of our water development projects  including the cadiz program 
in addition to the risks associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits with respect to our water development projects  including litigation by environmental or other groups which may delay or even prevent implementation of the cadiz program  we may also encounter unforeseen technical difficulties  which could result in construction delays  and cost increases or determination that a project is not feasible 
we are continuing to negotiate the terms and conditions of water storage and supply programs with various california water agencies including metropolitan with respect to preparing the final agreement for the cadiz program 
however  the outcome of these negotiations cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties  including hydrologic risks of variable water supplies  risks presented by allocations of water under existing and prospective priorities  and risks of adverse changes to or page interpretations of us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
risks of not being able to pay dividends 
we are restricted by contract from paying dividends and we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  any return on investment on our common stock will depend primarily upon appreciation in the price of the common stock 
to date  we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
the ability to receive distributions from sun world s cash flow and to pay dividends in turn to stockholders is restricted by a series of covenants in the indenture governing the sun world notes 
these covenants do not allow for the payment of dividends by us or by sun world other than out of cumulative net income 
similar restrictions are contained in the loan documents governing sun world s secured million revolving credit facility  sun world s million unsecured term loan and cadiz million revolving credit facility 
as we have a history of operating losses  we have been unable to date to pay dividends 
other important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by or on our behalf are discussed elsewhere within this form k in the sections entitled outlook  seasonality  regulation  competition and liquidity and capital resources 
d critical accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of cadiz  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
to date we have not had significant revenue earned from our water development programs 
as such  virtually all of our revenue has come from sun world s agricultural operations 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
sun world s revenues consist primarily of sales of fresh fruits and vegetables to large domestic national and regional supermarket chain stores and produce brokers  sales of juice to wineries and juice cooperatives  sales of raisins to processors  packing and marketing for third party growers  international licensing  project development and management services  and other miscellaneous receivables 
revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
packing revenues and marketing commissions from third party growers are recognized when the related services are provided 
for licensing  revenue is recognized when the licensee s product has been sold 
project development and management fees are recorded when earned under the terms of the related agreement 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for costs associated with any estimated returns or allowances which occur in the produce industry given the perishable nature of sun world s products 
we have page concluded that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
management estimates what market conditions will be for produce based on the age  size  quality and overall market for fresh product held in inventory at the end of each reporting period 
when future market conditions indicate that the cost of the inventory plus any additional selling expenses exceed the expected net revenues to be received  we provide a reserve for the amount of estimated costs in excess of estimated net revenues 
management also regularly conducts a review of non product inventory that consists primarily of corrugated boxes  chemicals and seed 
appropriate allowances are made based on management s review for all excess and obsolete inventory compared to estimated future usage and sales 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
at sun world  management regularly reviews crop portfolios in an attempt to identify crops that are underperforming generally at the conclusion of each growing season 
as a result of these reviews  management determines which crops will be removed immediately or at the conclusion of the next growing season 
as such  appropriate writedowns and accruals for estimated removal costs are made and where appropriate  remaining useful lives are shortened to correspond to the estimated period that the assets will are expected to generate future revenues 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
to date  we have had a history of net operating losses as we have not generated significant revenue from our water development programs and sun world has experienced losses from its agricultural operations 
as such  we have generated significant deferred tax assets  including large net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income taxes for which we have a full valuation allowance 
management is currently working on initiatives at cadiz and sun world that are designed to generate future taxable income  although there can be no guarantee that this will occur 
as taxable income is generated  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years
