item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the primary factors affecting premier financial bancorp  inc s the company or premier performance and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts and per share data have been restated to give the effect of acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all dollar amounts except per share data are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
overview in  premier continued efforts to make stronger its network of independently managed community banks by way of a more centralized corporate structure 
in doing so  premier suspended its acquisition strategy in order to focus on improving operations  strengthening capital and management oversight and improving profitability at the banks previously acquired 
as part of this change in strategy premier elected to dispose of two of its subsidiary banks  the bank of mt 
vernon and the sabina bank 
while premier remains committed to its core strategy of rural banking with community oriented and named institutions  the company may dispose of additional corporate assets that no longer meet premier s geographic or operational performance goals

net interest income premier s primary source of revenue is its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on its earning assets and the interest paid on the funds acquired to support those assets 
loans made to businesses and individuals are the primary interest earning assets  followed by investment securities and federal funds sold in the inter bank market 
deposits are the primary interest bearing liabilities used to support the interest earning assets 
the level of net interest income is affected by both the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the changes in their corresponding yields and costs  by the volume of interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing deposits  and the level of capital 
premier s long term objective is to manage this income to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate  credit and liquidity risks 
nontaxable income from loans and investment securities is presented on a tax equivalent basis whereby income exempt from tax has been adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the prevailing federal income taxes that would have been paid if the income had been fully taxable 
the discussion of factors influencing net interest income that follows is based on taxable equivalent data 
in each of the three years  this adjustment is based on an assumed federal income tax rate of

in  tax equivalent net income was  which reflected a decrease of  from  in the larger portion of the decrease related to  in lower average earning assets and  in lower interest bearing liabilities 
the primary drivers of these lower volumes were of course the sale of the banking operations that occurred during the lower volumes resulted in  of lower net interest income 
the yield on earning assets in of was basis points lower than the earned in  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in consequently  premier s net interest spread decreased from in to in and the net interest margin decreased from in to in while a portion of the decrease in net interest spread was the result of changes in the portfolio makeup from the sales of two subsidiary banking operations  a lower overall interest rate environment in lead to shrinkage in the pricing of interest earning assets that were added or repriced during while similar changes occurred on the liability side  the impact was smaller and the net result was the margin shrinkage discussed above 
in terms of dollars the decrease in margin relating to lower rates in versus was in  tax equivalent net interest income was  an amount essentially unchanged from the  in the net interest income is the result of an increase of  or in average earning assets and an increase of  or in average interest bearing liabilities

the reduction in yield on loans can be attributed to the liquidations of the higher yielding subprime real estate portfolio  the increase in the average balance of nonaccrual loans  and the increased level of competition experienced with the growth in the volume of loans

provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains its allowance for loan losses allowance at a level that is considered sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for probable loan losses as well as recoveries of previously charged off loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
the provision is the necessary charge to expense to provide for current loan losses and to maintain the allowance at an adequate level commensurate with management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
various factors are taken into consideration when the company determines the amount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance 
some of the factors include past due and nonperforming assets  specific internal analyses of loans requiring special attention  the current level of regulatory classified and criticized assets and the associated risk factors with each  examinations and reviews by the company s independent accountants  external and internal loan review personnel  and examinations of the loan portfolio by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the data collected from these sources is evaluated with regard to current national and local economic trends  prior loss history  underlying collateral values  credit concentrations  and industry risks 
an estimate of potential future loss on specific loans is developed in conjunction with an overall risk evaluation of the total loan portfolio

provision for loan losses 



allowance as a percentage of year end net loans allowance as a multiple of net charge offs the provision for loan losses for was  compared to  in  an increase of  this increase can be mainly attributed to additional charge offs and an increase in nonperforming assets 
in  net charge offs were  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in net charge offs is primarily attributed to the deterioration in the loan portfolios in certain markets served by the subsidiary banks 
at december   premier s allowance for loan losses was of period end loans compared to at december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year compared to 
for the year at december   premier s allowance for loan losses totaled  representing an increase of  over the amount for december  the allowance for loan losses was of nonperforming loans on december   compared to at december  at year end  nonperforming loans represented of total outstanding loans  up from on december  the following table sets forth an allocation for the allowance for loan losses by category of loan and a percentage of loans in that category 
in making the allocation  consideration was given primarily to management s best estimates as to the current losses in the portfolio 
the components considered in arriving at these amounts included identified specific risks in the portfolio  along with current trends in losses and non performing in the specific loan categories 
an allocation for the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance that will be used to cover future charge offs in each major loan category  but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan being used to absorb losses of another loan type 
the loan loss reserve represents managements best estimate of the actual losses anticipated in the portfolio that are reasonably likely and probable to occur 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses and percent of loans to total loans dollars in thousands at december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial      real estate mortgage     consumer   unallocated  total      any reallocation to the allowance is primarily indicative of changes in loan portfolio mix  not changes in loan concentrations or terms 
the company does consider quality in regards to specific loans when determining an adequate allowance allocation 
the level of increase in nonperforming loans  which is more specifically addressed in the nonperforming loan section  is largely attributable to deterioration in loan quality as well as the company s efforts at improving risk identification and monitoring 
noninterest income and expenses noninterest income is a significant component of the company s total income 
the company continues to develop and enhance existing products and to create new products in order to augment fee income as trends in the financial services industry and the economic environment continue to put pressure on the company s ability to increase its net interest income 
noninterest income includes deposit service charges  fees from data processing and trust services  fees and commissions from many other corporate and retail products and gains and losses from the sale of investment securities 
total fees and other income in decreased or to  from  in service charges on deposit accounts decreased or to  from  in insurance commissions decreased and other income increased 
the service charge and insurance commission decreases were in large part due to the result of the sales of the subsidiary banking operations during total fees and other income increased or in to  from  in service charges on deposit accounts increased and all other income increased 
gains on the sale of investment securities in were  an increase of from the losses of in investment securities in investment securities losses in were versus gains of in  a decrease of premier recognized gains of  in from the sale of two of its subsidiary banking operations

this gain was substantially offset by losses on securities of  which was also recognized in the second quarter of noninterest expenses decreased  or in  from  in to  in  and increased  or in from  in the primary factor resulting in the decrease in expenses was the sale during the year of two subsidiary banking operations 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  decreased in and increased in the changes include salary increases and reflect changes in the number of full time equivalent employees from at december  to at december  and at december  the decrease for reflects the sales of two subsidiary banking operations during the year 
the increase can be primarily attributed to the addition of three banking locations  the expensing of severance costs and annual salary increases 
occupancy and equipment expense for of  was or lower than the  for the increase in was  or  more than the  expensed in the decrease was the result of the sale of two subsidiary banking operations during the year 
the increase in is primarily attributable to the expansion in the number of banking locations 
other noninterest expense  which is the second largest category  decreased or in and increased  or in the decrease was the result of the sale of two subsidiary banking operations during the year 
the increases are primarily attributed to write downs of other real estate owned of approximately and increased costs associated with heightened levels of risk identification and controls 
amortization of intangibles decreased or to  for from the amount of  the amortization was a decrease of from the amount of  the significant decrease was the result of the reduction in intangibles related to the sale of the two subsidiary banking operations during the company continually seeks to develop fees and other income for services provided while holding operating expenses to the minimum amount required to provide quality service

an analysis of the difference between the effective tax rates and the statutory us federal income tax rate is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition lending activities loans are the company s primary use of financial resources and represent the largest component of earning assets 
the company s loans are made predominantly within the banks market areas and the portfolio is diversified 
credit risk is inherent in each financial institution s loan and investment portfolio 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  the company utilizes a credit administration network  including specific lending authorities for each loan officer  a system of loan committees to review and approve loans  and a loan review and credit quality rating system 
this network assists in the evaluation of the quality of new loans and in the identification of problem or potential problem credits and provides information to aid management and the board of directors in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
during  the company continued its efforts to strengthen its procedures and policies relating to credit risk identification and monitoring 
those efforts should enhance the scope  breadth  and depth of the company s credit risk identification processes 
total loans  net of unearned income  averaged  in compared with  in at year end  loans net of unearned income totaled  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in loan balances was primarily the result of the sales of two of the affiliate banking operations in the following table presents a summary of the company s loan portfolio by category for each of the last five years 
other than the categories noted  there is no concentration of loans in any industry greater than in the portfolio 
the company has no foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions in its loan portfolio

collateral for real estate mortgage loans include residential properties and the loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan based on recent independent appraisals 
the company s real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
a number of the banks do participate in the origination of loans into the secondary market and recognize the referral fees into other income 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in a bank s defined market area who are known to the bank s staff 
consumer loans are made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

all loans considered impaired under sfas are included in nonperforming loans 
the company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans when management believes after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
a loan remains in a nonaccrual status until doubts concerning the collectibility no longer exist 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the loan under the original terms 
other real estate is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell

the increase in total nonperforming loans and other real estate owned of  is largely attributable to the deterioration in loan quality as well as a result of the company s efforts at improving risk identification and monitoring 
reserves allocated in connection with these assets are believed to be adequate 
the company continues to follow its long standing policy of not engaging in international lending and not concentrating lending activity in any one industry 
although loans may be classified as nonperforming  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contractual rates

deposit activities managing the mix and repricing of deposit liabilities is an important aspect of the company s ability to maximize its net interest margin 
the strategies used to manage interest bearing deposit liabilities are designed to adjust as the interest rate environment changes 
in this regard  management of the company regularly assesses its funding needs  deposit pricing  and interest rate outlooks 
total deposits averaged  in  an decrease from total deposits averaged  in  an increase of  or over noninterest bearing deposits averaged of total deposits in  compared to in and in at december   deposits totaled  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or

stockholders equity increased  or in from million at december  to million for the primary reason for the increase in stockholders equity was the decrease in unrealized loss on securities of  from  on december   to on december  the decrease was partially offset by the retention of net earnings of in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity detail the changes in equity for the last three years 
the fair value adjustment of the company s available for sale securities portfolio  which is recorded as a component of stockholders equity  may change significantly as market conditions change 
the adjustment resulted in an increase of stockholders equity of at december  versus a reduction of at december  further volatility in stockholders equity may occur in the future as market conditions change 
the company s principal source of funds for dividend payments to stockholders is dividends received from the subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the banks could  without prior approval  declare dividends to the company of approximately million plus any net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration 
the various regulatory agencies having supervisory authority over financial institutions have adopted risk based capital guidelines  which define the adequacy of the capital levels of regulated institutions 
these risk based capital guidelines require minimum levels of capital based upon the risk rating of assets and certain off balance sheet items 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned regulatory risk weights ranging from to depending on their level of credit risk 
the guidelines classify capital in two tiers  tier i and tier  the sum of which is total capital 
tier i capital is essentially common equity  less intangible assets

liquidity liquidity for a financial institution can be expressed in terms of maintaining sufficient cash flows to meet both existing and unplanned obligations in a cost effective manner 
adequate liquidity allows the company to meet the demands of both the borrower and the depositor on a timely basis  as well as pursuing other business opportunities as they arise 
thus  liquidity management embodies both an asset and liability aspect 
liquidity is maintained through the company s ability to convert assets into cash  manage the maturities of liabilities and generate funds through the attraction of local deposits 
as part of its liquidity management  the company maintains funding relationships with the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions 
the company prefers to manage its liquidity requirements generally through the matching of maturities of assets and liabilities 
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented in the financial statements provide an indication of the company s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
liquidity risk is the possibility that the company may not be able to meet its cash requirements 
management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and meets the needs of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
liquidity must be maintained at a level  which is adequate but not excessive 
excess liquidity has a negative impact on earnings resulting from the lower yields on short term assets 
the company s principal source of funds to meet the cash requirements of the holding company is dividends received from its subsidiaries and the cash flows provided by intercompany tax payments 
additional funds have been provided in prior years from the borrowings on the company s credit facilities 
the company expects the cash flows from its subsidiaries to be sufficient to meet its cash requirements  however the company has identified certain assets that could be sold to generate additional funds as needed 
cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold  and the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity to the subsidiary banks 
the total of securities maturing within one year along with cash  due from banks  interest earning balances with banks maturing within one year  and federal funds sold totaled million as of december  additionally  securities available for sale with maturities greater than one year  equity securities  and interest earning balances  with banks with maturities greater than one year  totaled million at december  these securities represent a secondary source available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
to maintain a desired level of liquidity  the banks have several sources of funds available 
one is the cash flow generated daily from the banks various loan portfolios in the form of principal and interest payments 
another source is its deposit base 
the company maintains a relatively stable base of customer deposits  which has historically exhibited steady growth 
this growth  when combined with other sources  is expected to be adequate to meet its demand for funds 
due to the nature of the markets served by the company s subsidiary banks  management believes that the majority of certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
certificates of deposits and other time deposits of  or more represented approximately and of total deposits at december  and a number of techniques are used to measure the liquidity position  including the utilization of ratios that are presented below 
these ratios are calculated based on annual averages for each year 
liquidity ratios total loans total deposits total loans total deposits less float this analysis shows that the company s loan to deposit ratio has increased in both and the increases are primarily the result of funds moving from lower yielding assets into higher yielding loans  principally in the west virginia markets 
the change for was the result of the changes in loan and deposit mix as a result of the disposal of two affiliate banks during information regarding short term borrowings for the past three years is presented below

interest rate sensitivity the interest spread and liability funding discussed above are directly related to changes in asset and liability mixes  volumes  maturities and repricing opportunities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those  which are subject to being repriced in the near term  including either floating or adjustable rate instruments and instruments approaching maturity 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest sensitive assets and total interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rates on the company s various asset and liability categories do not respond uniformly to changing market conditions 
interest rate risk is the degree to which interest rate fluctuations in the marketplace can affect net interest income 
the need for interest sensitivity gap management is most critical in times of a significant change in overall interest rates 
management generally seeks to limit the exposure of the company to interest rate fluctuations by maintaining a relatively balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a one year time horizon 
this mix is altered periodically depending upon management s assessment of current business conditions and the interest rate outlook 
one tool  which is used to monitor interest rate risk  is the interest sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below 
this analysis reflects the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the gap indicates the level of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing over a given time period 
as shown by the interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   the cumulative amount of the company s interest earning assets repricing during the first year is lower than the total amount of its interest bearing liabilities repricing during this period 
this position  which is normally termed a negative interest sensitivity gap  generally allows for enhanced net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
this negative gap is within the company s internal policy guidelines and is not expected to impact significantly the company s net interest income during a period of rising interest rates

premier s market risk is composed almost exclusively with interest rate risk 
this exposure is managed primarily through the strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since premier s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms  which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s board of directors is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of an earnings simulation model prepared by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would decrease by approximately of stable rate net interest income if rates rise by basis points over the next year 
it projects a decrease of if the rates fall by basis points 
management believes this reflects a slight asset sensitive rate risk position for the less than day time frame 
for the one year horizon the rate risk position evolves into one with a slight liability sensitivity 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in rates  the model forecasts that net interest income would drop below that earned in a stable rate environment by in a rising rate scenario and decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point forecast  the percentage changes in net interest income are within alco guidelines 
this simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time 
loan prepayments are developed from industry median estimates for prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit pricing and sensitivity are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the economic value at risk evr of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in evr is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at december   a basis point increase in rates is estimated to increase evr by 
additionally  evr is projected to decrease by if rates fall by basis points 
although the decrease is outside the stated alco guidelines of the board has approved this deviation and management believes this deviation to be temporary 
the calculations of present value have certain shortcomings 
the discount rates utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in this calculation  and therefore  would likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates utilized for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which are not necessarily indicative of the present value of deposits and fhlb advances since such deposits and advances are unique to  and have certain price and customer relationship advantages for  depository institutions 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier designed to further mitigate the effect on the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s net assets from any change in interest rates

base rate interest rate risk management premier s strategy of investing primarily in loans and securities is intended to limit its exposure to interest rate and credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
managing this exposure involves significant assumptions about the relationship of various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments 
prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates making fixed rate loans more desirable 
other investment securities  other than those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal  while term federal home loan bank advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage prepayment prior to maturity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant interest rate increase 
the previous table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on premier s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities are subject to competitive and other pressures beyond our control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
management expects interest rates to be biased toward flat to increasing during and believes that the current modest level of liability sensitivity is appropriate when taken in conjunction with the unlikely event of a significant rate decrease 
premier s interest sensitivity profile changed from to as a result primarily of asset liability mix changes as a result of the sales of two affiliate banking operations as well as normal maturities and repricing 
trade risk management premier does not maintain a trading account  which would primarily provide investment products and risk management services to its customers as well as to take propriety risk positions 
derivative instruments a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
premier currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps or options 
however  the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit  which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized on the balance sheets 
commitments to make loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any contract condition 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral if deemed necessary 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by premier to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specific terms and conditions 
commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the company until the instrument is exercised
