forward looking statements the following discussions contain forward looking statements that are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations of the bank and the company 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company and its subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality and composition of the loan and investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  and changes in relevant accounting principles 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
business strategy the company believes that pursuing a strategy to broaden the range of products and services offered should offset the declining margins in the competitive market for one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the strategy includes increasing the percentage of higher yielding and more interest sensitive assets  increasing the percentage of commercial and consumer loans and commercial deposit accounts  utilizing alternative sources of funding at reasonable rates  increasing sources of non interest income  utilizing its computer network for enhanced sales  service and security features  and utilizing alternative delivery systems  including its internet banking product  and investigating an enhanced customer care center strategy 
highlights of the business strategy are as follows community oriented institution 
based on total assets  the bank is the largest independent financial institution headquartered in polk county  florida 
the bank is committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which it operates 
management believes that the bank is large enough to provide a full range of personal and business financial services  and yet is small enough to provide such services in a personalized and efficient manner 
it is the bank s current plan to deliver the products and services that meet the needs of its customers 
commercial banking 
the bank continues to expand its lending programs for commercial business and commercial real estate loans in an effort to satisfy a perceived need within its market area and increase its loan portfolio 
the bank continues to realize a positive impact on its net interest margin since commercial customers provide fair yields on loans  loans that generally provide for shorter maturities or repricing periods than the traditional residential mortgage loan  and provide a source of lower cost funds 
the risks of commercial lending relate to the source of repayment of the loan which is weighted toward the ability to repay versus being primarily collateral dependent 
in recent years  the bank has assembled an experienced commercial lending team to support its increased activities in this area and to increase its penetration into the smaller businesses operating in its market areas 
branch acquisition 
on february   the company finalized the purchase of seven florida retail sales offices branch acquisition from suntrust bank coincident with suntrust bank s acquisition of such offices from huntington national bank huntington 
the transaction resulted in the company receiving approximately million in cash  and included approximately million in deposits and approximately million in loans related to those seven offices 
the company paid a premium of approximately 
this premium  along with additional acquisition costs  resulted in a core deposit intangible asset of million being recorded which is subject to periodic amortization over a period of twelve years 
the cash received from the purchase was primarily used to reduce million in short term fixed rate and adjustable rate fhlb advances and fund the purchase of approximately million in securities 
the securities were primarily mortgage backed securities with average lives less than five years that provide cash flow from the time of purchase 
this strategy allows the company to immediately earn a fair rate of return on the invested funds and utilize the cash flow from the securities to fund new loan originations 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  assets 
total assets increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total assets resulted primarily from the assets acquired in the branch acquisition total assets added were million  less the funds that were utilized to immediately reduce our borrowing position by million 
overall securities increased million  or  through deployment of the funds in the branch acquisition and additional purchases of securities that fit the company s strategic plan to increase profitability and leverage its capital 
the loan portfolio remained basically flat during the year  except for the million in commercial and consumer loans acquired in the branch acquisition 
management continues to concentrate its efforts to grow the commercial and consumer loan portfolio to gradually leverage its capital 
the capital leveraging strategy also includes the purchase of securities to complement its loan origination efforts 
cash and cash equivalents increased million due to excess funds resulting from million in a u 
s 
treasury borrowing program that placed funds in the bank just prior to year end 
premises and equipment increased million primarily due to the construction of a new office  offices acquired in the branch acquisition  equipment for two offices  renovations at several offices and capital expenditures to implement certain phases of the strategic technology plan 
cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance increased million primarily due the purchase of million of additional policies  together with an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in total liabilities resulted mainly due to a net deposit increase of million 
the increase in deposits resulted primarily from the million of deposits acquired in the branch acquisition 
in addition  checking and money market accounts experienced continued strong growth through expansion of the customer base 
management continues to evaluate the available funding sources 
the attributes of the alternative funding sources that management considers in its analysis include the interest and other costs of such funding  the maturity considerations and the nature and characteristics of assets being funded 
stockholder s equity 
the million increase in the stockholders equity includes million in net income  repurchase of  shares of the company s stock at a cost of million  purchase of  shares of the company s stock for the restricted stock plan at a cost of million  less shares issued at a cost of approximately million  net distribution of million from the restricted stock plan for vesting of certain awards  increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  repayment of  on the employee stock ownership plan esop loan  and dividends paid totaling million 
the increased value in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from the fluctuation in market value of the company s securities available for sale 
because of continued interest rate volatility  accumulated other comprehensive income and stockholders equity could materially fluctuate for each interim and year end period 
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity of a savings institution reflects its ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to take advantage of market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match the maturities of short term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
an institution s liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature and mix of the institution s sources and uses of funds 
assets providing liquidity are generated through loan repayments  loan sale and the management of maturity distributions for loans and securities 
an important aspect of liquidity management lies in maintaining sufficient levels of loans and mortgage backed securities that generate monthly cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended september  significant cash flows or uses amounts shown in parentheses were as follows in millions cash provided by operations cash received upon purchase of deposits federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings increase in net deposits  exclusive of branch acquisition sales  maturities of and repayments on securities net purchases of securities and fhlb stock net purchases of premises and equipment  exclusive of branch acquisition net decrease in loans  exclusive of branch acquisition purchase of bank owned life insurance payments to acquire treasury stock and restricted stock plan shares dividends paid other  net net increase in cash and cash equivalents the company is subject to federal regulations that impose certain minimum capital requirements 
for a discussion on such capital levels  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital or operations nor is management aware of any current recommendation by regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loans and securities interest earning assets and interest paid on its deposits and any borrowed funds interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  and the aggregate amounts of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the periods indicated 
the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
similar information is provided as of september  average balances are derived from daily average balances 
year ended september  at september  actual average average average actual yield average yield average yield average yield balance cost balance interest cost balance interest cost balance interest cost interest earning assets residential        consumer        commercial        total loans        securities and other        total interest earning assets        noninterest earning assets     total assets     interest bearing liabilities checking accounts     savings accounts     money market accounts        certificate accounts        total deposits        fhlb advances and other borrowings        total interest bearing liabilities        noninterest bearing liabilities     total liabilities      stockholders equity     total liabilities and stockholders equity     net interest income    interest rate spread net margin on interest earning assets average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities average balances include nonaccrual loans 
securities and other includes securities available for sale and held to maturity  interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock 
includes noninterest bearing checking accounts 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net margin on interest earning assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
interest income and net interest income do not agree to the consolidated statement of earnings because the tax equivalent income based on effective tax rate of on municipal bonds is included in this schedule 
interest in includes interest expense on million of funds received from the public stock offering 
rate volume analysis 
the relationship between the volume and rates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affects the company s net interest income 
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the company s interest income and interest expense to changes in volume and in prevailing interest rates during the periods indicated 
each category reflects the changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by old rate  changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by old volume  and net change 
the net change attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to the absolute dollar amounts of change in each

net income for the year ended september  increased  or to million  compared to million for the year ended september net interest income increased million  or  for the year ended september  compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from interest income increasing million  together with a decrease in interest expense of  noninterest income increased by million from to due mainly to o increased fees and service charges mainly related to the branch acquisition  o earnings related to bank owned life insurance policies  o gains on sale of mortgage loans  o net gains on sale of securities 
noninterest expenses increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   due to increases in several expense categories  as discussed below 
interest income 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest income during the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
detailed changes are contained in the average balance sheet table 
while residential loan balances decreased as a result of loan sales and accelerated repayments  consumer and commercial loan balances increased primarily due to the addition of the loans acquired in the branch acquisition 
the company continues to emphasize commercial and consumer loan growth in an effort to restructure its loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans decreased  as the sharp decrease in shorter term interest rates throughout calendar had a major impact on consumer and commercial loan yields 
the decrease in the commercial loan yield can also be attributed to a change in the mix of the portfolio and the intense competition for these loans 
increased refinance activity  due to the overall lower interest rate environment  brought about a decrease in residential loan yields 
the average balances in the securities portfolio grew as the company invested funds received from the branch acquisition  while it continued to pursue the strategy of leveraging the capital raised in april and december the lower yield in the securities portfolio resulted from a shift to shorter duration and adjustable rate securities in fiscal to manage the interest rate risk profile of the company  as well as the previously mentioned federal reserve policy to reduce short term interest rates 
interest expense 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest expense during the year ended september  when compared to the prior year 
detailed changes are contained in the average balance sheet table 
deposit growth of was primarily attributable to the branch acquisition 
however  our increased sales effort to attract new and retain current deposits  as well as customer concerns about equity investments  provided additional deposit growth 
average fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased due to the repayment of short term fixed rate and adjustable rate advances with funds provided by the branch acquisition 
the growth in average balances in interest checking and money market accounts helped to reduce the overall cost of deposits  which is reflective of the significant decrease in interest rates over the past year 
the reduction in cost of funds related to the fhlb advances and other borrowings reflects the company s decision to replace short term fixed rate advances with short term daily rate credit advances and advances utilizing the treasury investment program 
actions by the federal reserve to decrease short term interest rates has provided a reduction in the cost of adjustable rate credit advances  however  greater declines in the overall cost of advances were not achieved due to higher rate convertible advances taken out in when the consensus of opinion at that time was that rates would continue to increase 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management s best estimates of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date  based on historical experience  volume and type of lending conducted by the company  industry standards  the level and status of past due and nonperforming loans  the general economic conditions in the company s lending area and other factors affecting the collectability of the loans in its portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimates of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
however  there can be no assurance that the allowance for losses will be adequate to cover losses  which may be realized in the future  and that additional provisions for losses will not be required 
the provision for loan losses was  for the year ended september  compared to  for fiscal the provision for loan losses increased for the current year primarily as a result of increased consumer loan growth from the seven new retail sales offices 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million at september  from million at september  an additional million was added to the allowance for loan losses related to loans acquired in the branch acquisition due to the loans being underwritten on a different basis than the company s guidelines 
a higher charge off percentage is anticipated on the loans acquired 
the current allowance represents 
of loans outstanding at september  the company had net charge offs of  approximately of which related to loans acquired in the branch acquisition  for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of  for fiscal in addition  our classified assets increased million as further discussed at page the company intends to maintain its allowance for loan losses commensurate with its loan portfolio and classified assets  especially its commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million to million for the year ended september  the major components of the increase was due to the following gains of  recognized on the sale of million in long term fixed rate mortgage loans  an increase of  from fiscal  an increase in net gain on sale of securities available for sale of  including  in net gains on the sales of million securities available for sale 
the current year gains include the recovery of  on a corporate bond previously written down due to a decline that was deemed to be other than temporary  an increase of  in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of an additional million in insurance contracts in and and the recognition of  in equity securities received in the demutualization of an insurance company where the company was a policy holder  an increase of  in account fees and service charges  primarily due to the overall increase in deposit accounts  the majority of which relate to the branch acquisition 
an increase of  in other noninterest income  primarily due to recognition a  deferred gain related to the sale of a former bank property previously deferred due to possible environmental cleanup concerns 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the major components of the increase was due to the following compensation and employee benefits increased million due primarily to o increase of  due to the addition of the seven retail sales offices staff members related to the branch acquisition  and  in additional costs for the full year operation of two branches opened in the past two years  o average salary increases due to merit and cost of living adjustments  o increase in mortgage loan commissions of  due to a change in commission structure  and a million increase in loan origination volume over the prior year  o a  increase for health insurance costs due to the growth in the employee base  including the branch acquisition  as well as increased claims experience  o increased costs of  related to the restricted stock plan  o increase of  related to the cost of the esop due to the increase in the company s stock price 
occupancy and equipment costs increased  due primarily to o full year utilization of new customer delivery software  including an internet banking package  o the opening of two new retail sales offices  o operation of seven new retail sales offices acquired in the branch acquisition  and o extensive remodeling at several retail sales offices 
postage and office supplies expense increased  primarily attributable to the branch acquisition and the conversion to proof of deposit pod 
amortization of million of the core deposit intangible that was established in the branch acquisition transaction 
other expenses increased by million primarily due to the following o increase of  for the restricted stock plan for directors  o increase of  in correspondent bank charges primarily relating to the higher costs relating to the pod conversion and the branch acquisition creating an increased volume of items processed  o increase of  in other operating expense primarily due to the write down of a winter haven property that was originally scheduled to be a retail sales office  but is now being actively marketed for sale 
o increase of  in security guard expenses related to a series of robberies that occurred during the year  o increase of  in debit card expenses related to increased volume from additional card holders acquired in the branch acquisition  o  in acquisition related costs that could not be capitalized  o  in additional telephone and data communication costs due to the expanded branch network and upgrade of communication channels 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and september  net income 
net income for the year ended september  increased million  or to million  compared to million for the year ended september  net income for the year ended september  benefited from the deployment of million in new capital received from stock issued in december net interest income increased million  or  for the year ended september  compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from interest income increasing million  offset by an increase in interest expense of million  noninterest income increased by  from to due mainly to increase in cash surrender value on the bank owned life insurance product and gains on sale of mortgage loans  and noninterest expenses increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   due to a net increase in the expense categories  as discussed below 
interest income 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest income during the year ended september  when compared to the prior year 
detailed changes are contained in the average balance sheet table 
loan growth reflected strong commercial loan demand over the past year 
while the company s major emphasis was on commercial and consumer loan origination efforts  mortgage originations remained strong throughout the yield on loans increased due to the emphasis placed on commercial and consumer loans in our market areas 
new mortgage loan rates decreased throughout the latter half of although new mortgage loan rates decreased throughout most of the year  about of the company s new originations were construction loans that were not fully disbursed during the year 
the result of the timing on the construction loan disbursements kept the yields on mortgage loans from decreasing in relation to the overall decrease in mortgage loan pricing 
the average balances in the securities portfolio grew primarily due to the company s strategy to leverage capital that was raised in the stock offering 
the yield in the securities portfolio decreased as a result of a steady decrease in market interest rates throughout fiscal in addition  securities growth followed a strategy of purchasing securities that had slightly shorter average lives 
interest expense 
the following discussion highlights the major factors that impacted the changes in interest expense during the year ended september  when compared to the prior year 
detailed changes are contained in the average balance sheet table 
deposits grew because the company pursued a slightly aggressive pricing strategy as interest rates fell and the equity markets experienced significant volatility 
fhlb advances grew because the company considers the advances to be a cost effective funding alternative 
although the costs of the advances exceed the cost of certificate accounts  funding asset growth through certificate accounts was deemed to be more expensive than wholesale funding 
in addition  fhlb advances provide a funding vehicle to assist the company in extending the duration of its liabilities 
the reduction in cost of funds related to the fhlb advances is reflective of the drop in interest rates over the past year 
the reduction in the cost of the advances was not as significant as the overall drop in interest rates because of certain higher rate convertible advances taken in fiscal that have extended liability duration as rates have dropped 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is charged to operations to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management s best estimates of the losses inherent in the portfolio  based on historical experience  volume and type of lending conducted by the company  industry standards  the level and status of past due and nonperforming loans  the general economic conditions in the company s lending area and other factors affecting the collectibility of the loans in its portfolio 
for the year ended september   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for fiscal the allowance for loan losses at september  increased  from september  non performing loans increased  for the period  classified assets increased million and commercial and consumer loans increased in the aggregate of approximately million from september  such increases in classified loans and commercial and consumer loans precipitated the increase in the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimates of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
however  there can be no assurance that the allowance for losses will be adequate to cover losses which may be realized in the future and that additional provisions for losses will not be required 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by  to million for the year ended september  the major components of the increase was due to the following gains of  recognized on the sale of million in long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
increase of  in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
increase of  in checking and savings account service fees 
increase of  in income from increased debit card and atm usage 
loss of  due to the impairment of a security classified as available for sale 
the security had been downgraded below investment grade and during the fourth quarter  the issuer filed for bankruptcy 
the fair value of this security could decline further and the company could recognize further losses 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the major components of the increase was due to the following compensation and employee benefits increased million due primarily to o an approximate increase in staffing  o annual salary adjustments  o increased health insurance claims during the year  o increased expenses related to the esop due to the increase in the company s stock price 
occupancy and equipment costs of  due primarily to o new customer delivery software  including an internet banking package  o the opening of two new branch office locations  o remodeling costs at the main office 
other expenses increased by  primarily due to the following o increased telephone expense due to enhanced data and voice communications  o increase in atm and debit card usage  o increased check clearing charges due to increased volume of items processed  offsetting the increase in noninterest expenses was a  decrease in marketing expense due to o a bidding process instituted for vendors in order to better control costs  o emphasis on community support programs versus media advertising  providing greater exposure within the communities we serve 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit gathering activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company does not engage in trading or hedging activities and does not invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while adjusting the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
qualitative analysis 
because the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  its most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  or changes in interest rates 
the company is vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
its lending activities have historically emphasized the origination of long term  fixed rate loans secured by single family residences 
the primary source of funds has been deposits with substantially shorter maturities 
while having interest bearing liabilities that reprice more frequently than interest earning assets is generally beneficial to net interest income during a period of declining interest rates  such an asset liability mismatch is generally detrimental during periods of rising interest rates 
in addition  the customers optionality to repay a loan or renegotiate the interest rate on the loan when interest rates move in their favor creates an additional variable in managing the asset liability structure of the bank 
the board of directors has established an asset liability committee that consists of the company s president and senior banking officers 
the committee meets on a monthly basis to review loan and deposit pricing and production volumes  interest rate risk analysis  liquidity and borrowing needs  and a variety of other asset and liability management issues 
to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income  the company has adopted various strategies to improve the matching of interest earning asset maturities to interest bearing liability maturities 
the principal elements of these strategies include the origination of commercial and consumer loans with adjustable rate features or fixed rate loans with shorter term maturities  lengthening the maturities of liabilities when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit and utilization of federal home loan bank advances  attracting low cost checking and transaction accounts which tend to be less sensitive to rising rates  and when market conditions permit  to originate and hold in its portfolio adjustable rate mortgage loans which have periodic interest rate adjustments 
the company also maintains a securities portfolio that provides a stable cash flow  thereby providing investable funds in varying interest rate cycles 
the company has also made a significant effort to maintain its level of lower cost deposits as a method of enhancing profitability 
at september   the company had of its deposits in savings  checking and money market accounts 
these deposits have traditionally remained relatively stable and are expected to be only moderately affected in a period of rising interest rates 
this stability has enabled the company to offset the impact of rising rates in other deposit accounts 
quantitative analysis 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by management 
the company s objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
the company uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the npv model measures interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in the npv of cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the npv model shows the degree to which balance sheet line items and npv are potentially affected by a to basis point change 
one basis point equals th of a percentage point 
reports generated by the npv model are reviewed by the asset liability management committee and reported to the board of directors quarterly 
the npv model uses an option based pricing approach to value one to four family mortgages  mortgages serviced by or for others  and firm commitments to buy  sell  or originate mortgages 
this approach makes use of an interest rate simulation program to generate numerous random interest rate paths that  in conjunction with a prepayment model  are used to estimate mortgage cash flows 
prepayment options and interest rate caps and floors contained in mortgages and mortgage related securities introduce significant uncertainty in estimating the timing of cash flows for these instruments that warrants the use of this sophisticated methodology 
all other financial instruments are valued using a static discounted cash flow method 
under this approach  the present value is determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to generate by the yields currently available to investors from an instrument of comparable risk and duration 
future interest rates and their effects on npv and net interest income are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  prepayments  and deposit run offs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in such computations 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
after a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result if our borrowers are unable to meet their repayment obligations as interest rates increase 
the following table presents the npv as of september  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon the above model assumptions and financial information provided by the company 
as illustrated in the table  the calculations show that the company would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and would benefit slightly by decreases in interest rates dollars in thousands 
npv as of net portfolio value npv present value of assets change basis point in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp   bp   bp  bp  
the ots defines the sensitivity measure as the change in npv ratio with a basis point shock 
our sensitivity measure reflects an basis point decline in npv ratio as of september  compared to a sensitivity measure of basis points as of september  the improvement in our sensitivity measure at september  primarily reflects the decrease in short term interest rates from september  and the lengthening in the maturities of certain liabilities
