item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations three years ended september  business environment the us economy remained generally sluggish throughout fiscal the equity market was already well into a slower period following declines in the technology and dot com equities when the events of september  shook the country s and the world s sense of well being 
these events  followed by the announcements by the likes of enron and worldcom  eroded investor confidence  particularly that of individual investors 
further discoveries of less than desirable accounting treatments and unethical management  ongoing investigations  continued market uncertainty and loan defaults have continued to plague the marketplace and resulted in not only a volatile and declining equity market but also in weaker credit markets 
the us federal reserve lowered the overnight interest rate three times during the fiscal year following eight rate reductions in the first three quarters of calendar  in an attempt to stimulate some economic recovery 
while this may have helped the housing market and  combined with auto manufacturer incentives  spurred auto sales  it had not stimulated a resurgence of the equity markets by fiscal year end 
this is evidenced by the fact the dow jones industrial average had its worst september performance in years and its worst quarterly showing since results of operations although revenues were the third highest in the company s history  they also marked the second consecutive year of decline as poor equity markets continued 
revenues of  were down from the prior year  with the decline in interest revenue accounting for more than all of this difference 
net income declined  but only when the prior year is adjusted to remove the positive million impact of the reversal of the excess reserve for the corporex litigation 
fiscal s revenues were down from fiscal and net income declined excluding the effects of the corporex litigation reserve 
the correlation of the decrease in revenues with the decrease in earnings in the current year reflects a combination of variable expenses and the company s adjustments to the poor market environment through improved cost control efforts

the number of retail fas increased between september and september  including the addition of retail fas through the acquisition of rj ltd

the decline in customer margin borrowing has been the primary reason for the decline in interest revenues 
interest income from margin loans has declined million from its peak in fiscal and million from fiscal the spread earned by the company through short term investment of customer interest bearing cash balances is much smaller than that earned through lending such funds as margin loans  and is negatively impacted by a declining rate scenario

the increase in non commission compensation expense between fiscal and is almost entirely attributable to including a full twelve months of rj ltd 
vs 
nine months in fiscal coupled with increased incentive compensation earned by capital markets professionals  both in the equity and fixed income departments 
these increases were somewhat offset by cost control efforts in the rja operations departments where headcount has declined from its high of  in march to  in september  and in retail where branch support personnel count was reduced in branches that have been unable to maintain historic production levels 
the increase in non commission compensation expense between fiscal and was a combination of the purchase of rj ltd  adding million  and increases in rja as capital markets  retail and operations reached their peak in the number of personnel during before beginning to scale back due to market conditions 
beginning in fiscal the company will expense stock options in accordance with sfas accounting for stock based compensation  which is expected to negatively impact earnings 
the financial accounting standards board has a proposal outstanding which will provide additional transition alternatives to companies adopting sfas the company has evaluated the alternatives proposed and if the proposal is enacted in its current form  the company will elect the alternative to apply the fair value method to all awards granted after the beginning of fiscal and to the unvested portion of all outstanding previous awards 
had this policy been in effect in fiscal the impact would have resulted in a reduction of net income of approximately million 
throughout this period there continued to be significant efforts to improve and support our information processing and to further automate processes 
the effect of these efforts is reflected in the increased communications and information processing expenses 
in addition  communications and information processing expense includes write downs of our investment in css our software joint venture in colorado as we converted to the equity method of accounting this year due to the increase in the company s ownership percentage 
these efforts affect all segments of the company s business  but retail in particular  as it has the largest transaction volume and is therefore allocated the largest percentage of processing expenses 
due to the current market conditions there has been a renewed emphasis on cost control  particularly with respect to travel costs  advertising and other business development expenses 
year to year comparisons of other expense are distorted by the large addition to reserves for the corporex judgment in fiscal  of which million was subsequently reversed in fiscal when the case was settled 
fiscal other expense is up million  excluding the prior year reversal  substantially all related to additional legal costs and reserves related to the retail segment  including the adverse resolution of certain recruiting claims 
the number and magnitude of client claims has increased dramatically in the current negative equity market environment  including three significant matters described in part under legal matters 
certain critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us see summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  these include cash  cash equivalents  and securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with fasb  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in addition  even where the value of a secur ity is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of roney co 
and goepel mcdermid  inc now called rj ltd 
this goodwill  totaling million  was allocated to the reporting units within the retail and capital markets segments pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
the company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired on at least an annual basis 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  the company uses valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues  earnings  book value and discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
if the value of the goodwill is impaired  the difference between the value of the goodwill reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
see further discussion in effects of recently issued accounting standards 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in other payables 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client and financial advisor receivables 
client loans are collateralized by securities  real estate or other property 
reserves at rjbank are established and reviewed in accordance with banking regulations 
client loans at the broker dealers are collateralized by securities  however  if there is a decline in the value of the collateral and the company cannot obtain more collateral or collect on the loan  a reserve is established 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected

sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually  as well as under certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite

sfas is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after december   however the company elected to early adopt the standard as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  the company ceased all goodwill amortization and therefore did not recognize million of goodwill amortization expense that would have been recognized ratably during under the previous accounting standard

management of these risks is critical to the company s fiscal soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  credit  operational  regulatory and legal 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by the company is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments and  accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include financial instruments deemed sensitive to market risk 
financial instruments with market risk in s september  september  fair value government obligations corporate obligations municipal obligations mortgage backed securities total debt securities equity other securities total the tables above primarily represent trading inventories associated with the company s customer facilitation  market making activities and rjbank investments  and include net long and short fair values  which is consistent with the way risk exposure is managed 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the related gross long and short fair values of financial instruments owned and investments 
the company trades tax exempt and taxable debt obligations including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations 
the company is also an active market maker in over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company maintains inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions 
the company also invests for its own proprietary equity investment account and takes interest rate swap and eurodollar futures positions 
changes in value of the company s trading and investment inventories may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings  equity prices and the correlation among these factors  along with the level of volatility 
the company manages its trading inventories by product type and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product type 
the trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions  considering the risk and profitability of each inventory 
the company s primary method of controlling risk in its trading and investment inventories is through the use of limits 
as of september   the absolute fixed income inventory limits were  and absolute equity limits were  the average absolute fixed income inventory balance was  and the average absolute equity inventory balance was  during the year ended september  position limits in trading inventory accounts are established and monitored on a daily basis 
consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management 
limit violations are carefully monitored 
management monitors inventory levels and results of the trading groups  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
mark to market prices are obtained from an external vendor and are compared to internal valuations 
summarized results are reviewed and a valuation adjustment is determined by management to record the instrument at estimated fair value 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets including client loans  stock borrow activities  investments  and inventories and its funding sources including client cash balances  stock lending activities  and bank borrowings  which finance these assets 
the collateral underlying client margin loans  interest rate swaps and stock borrow loan activities at the broker dealer is repriced daily  thus there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending activities produce a positive spread to the company  with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel 
however  in times of rapid changes in interest rates the spreads may be impacted 
the company manages its inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  economically hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
while a significant portion of the company s securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over several times per year 
the company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to economically hedge a significant portion of its debt inventory 
these interest rate swap contracts and debt inventory are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
in addition  interest rate swap contracts are used at rjbank to hedge against the effect of fluctuating interest rates on the variable cash flow paid on the deposit base which serves as the funding source for loans 
rjbank assesses interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
rjbank maintains risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both rjbank s outstanding debt obligations as well as rjbank s offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on rjbank s future cash flows 
rjbank accounts for its swap activity as cash flow hedges under sfas and monitors this activity by reviewing effectiveness of the hedges in accordance with criteria of sfas the effective portion of the gain or loss is accumulated in other comprehensive income and the gain or loss on the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
the company also conducts an interest rate swap business with its institutional clients and takes trading positions to facilitate this business 
the interest rate swap activities  aside from the rjbank activity  have limits which are established and monitored through daily reports to the accounting department and weekly reports circulated to senior management of rja and rjf 
these reports reflect total market exposure of all open positions and the market value of outstanding positions with respect to each counter party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
for interest rate swap contracts the company uses notional contract amounts  daily mark to markets  as well as limited value at risk analysis and stress testing to measure and assess risks associated with this derivative and related cash activity 
notional amounts are not included on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition as these contract amounts are not actually paid or received 
notional amounts allow the company to calculate the cash flows to be exchanged and are not necessarily indicative of overall market risk 
the value at risk approach is used to derive a quantitative measure specifically for market risks under normal market conditions 
for a given portfolio  value at risk measures the possible future loss in terms of market value which  under normal market conditions  will not be exceeded within a defined probability in a certain period 
stress testing supplements other analyses of market risk as it helps to determine the possible effects of potential ly extreme market movements on the market value of the company s assets 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities 
the company s activities as a dealer are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits 
the company s equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
credit risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks and other financial institutions 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the credit worthiness of the counterparty and or the issuer of the instrument 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
the company s client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with the company s retail client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
when clients execute a purchase on margin the company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade 
if this occurs the company may have to liquidate the position at a loss 
however  for over three quarters of the retail purchase transactions clients have cash in the account before the trade is executed 
the company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities 
the company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
in addition  rjbank offers a variety of loan products including mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans which are collateralized and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored 
rjbank s policy is to require customers to provide collateral prior to the disbursement of approved loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by rjbank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  real estate  and income producing commercial properties 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  rjbank exposes itself to credit risk 
rjbank minimizes the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade 
the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreement to resell represent approximately of the company s total assets at september  and consist entirely of securities issued by the us government 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
the company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the company  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding 
the company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines continental and delta 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines ability to fulfill its lease obligations 
in the unlikely event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the company is unable to re lease or sell the plane with adequate terms the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
as of september   it is management s opinion that the value of this investment is not impaired 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
in order to mitigate an d control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the company s various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the company 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout the company 
the company has established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to review execution of customer orders by the otc  option and listed trading departments 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the retail firms  correspondent services  compliance and legal and is under the direction of a senior officer of rjf 
this committee reviews reports from otc  option and listed trading departments and recommends action for improvement when necessary 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of large numbers of retail customer claims  a potentially sizable adverse legal judgement and of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
the company has designated an anti money laundering compliance officer who has instituted procedures to assure compliance with regulations adopted under the usa patriot act 
the company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
the company acts as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  the company has legal exposure 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review s proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
the compliance departments are responsible for monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements at the respective branch offices of each broker dealer 
in addition  there are compliance officers concentrating on fixed income  equity capital markets and asset management who focus on the regulations specific to those businesses 
the company has experienced an increase in the number of retail claims as a result of the downturn in the equity markets
