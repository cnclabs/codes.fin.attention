critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue from primarily two sources i sale of sound processing and telecommunications peripheral equipment and ii services and support revenue for telecommunications equipment and unified messaging products 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of equipment upon shipment 
services and support revenue are recognized upon customer acceptance where a product deliverable or repair is called for  or ratably over the contract term in the case of support or maintenance contracts 
in the case of services subject to customer acceptance  recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances amounted to  in similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company then assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  the company includes an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily domestic and foreign net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the net current deferred tax asset as of december  was  the net long term deferred tax asset as december  was  net of a valuation allowance of  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to  as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company will cease to amortize goodwill 
the company has recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company expects to complete the initial review during the first half of the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation the company has several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  of assets and of total liabilities as of december  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses that  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if a subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the company disposes of a subsidiary  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into the statement of operations 
based on the assessment of the factors discussed above  the company considers the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of its international subsidiaries 
accordingly the company had cumulative translation losses of approximately  and  which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss within its balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during  and  translation adjustments of   and  respectively  were included under accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which it transacts business against the united states dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if determined that a change in the functional currency of one of its subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time the company would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations

in addition  sfas includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill  and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas  the company will cease to amortize approximately  of net goodwill 
in addition  the company will be required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we expect to complete this review during the first half of we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge may not be recorded
