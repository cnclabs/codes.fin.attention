critical accounting assumptions estimated net realizable value of property and equipment 
the company has been engaged in the development of manufacturing equipment to demonstrate the commercial viability of its manufacturing processes 
to this end the company has developed commercial manufacturing lines in owings mills  maryland and for goettingen  germany 
the operating equipment and machinery and related manufacturing assets are carried on the company s books at the lower of cost net of depreciation  or fair value 
the company s business plans for call for the transfer of operational and financial control of its manufacturing lines to its operating partners at such time as the machinery is demonstrated to perform at a level acceptable to the operating partner 
at the time of the transfer  the company expects to negotiate a fair market value for the equipment  not to exceed the then current replacement value of the equipment 
however  until the transfers and sales are complete  the company cannot be certain that such value will be realized 
failure of the equipment to perform at a level satisfactory to the licensee  failure to negotiate mutually agreeable terms of transfer  or any other failure to conclude the transfer of one or more of the operating lines to the respective licensees may require the company to consider alternative approaches to utilize the equipment such as finding an alternate licensee to take over  relocating the equipment  or dismantling the line 
any one of these alternatives could have a negative economic impact on the carrying value of the equipment 
for the purposes of these financial statements  the company has estimated the net realizable value of the manufacturing line equipment by obtaining third party assessment from one of its operating partners of the value it would be willing to pay for the equipment  if offered the opportunity to buy it 
this amount does not assign any value to the cost of leasehold improvements or installation costs that have already been expended to place the equipment in service 
going concern 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  during the period from november  inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of  and has a working capital deficit of  at december  these factors among others may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required  and ultimately to attain successful operations 
management is continuing its efforts to obtain additional funds so that the company can meet its obligations and sustain operations from sources that are described in the notes to the financial statements
