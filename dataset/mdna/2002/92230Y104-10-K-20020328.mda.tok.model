the company does not assume any obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth elsewhere in this form k and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
background our predecessor company  vasco corp  entered into the data security business in through the acquisition of a controlling interest in thumbscan  inc  which we renamed vasco data security  inc 
in in  we began an expansion of our computer security business by acquiring lintel security nv sa  a belgian corporation  including assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks 
in addition  in  we acquired the stock of digipass nv sa  a belgian corporation  which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies and whose name we changed to vasco data security nv sa in all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
on march   we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of vasco corp 
in the exchange offer  holders of the common stock and warrants  options and other rights to acquire common stock of our predecessor company exchanged their securities for the same number and kind of securities of our present company  and released any potential claims that such holders might have had against our predecessor in connection with the issuances of its securities and other corporate actions which occurred mostly during the s 
in the exchange offer  almost of our predecessor s securities were tendered and accepted for exchange 
in october  we completed the merger of our predecessor with and into the current company and thereby eliminated all remaining outstanding securities of our predecessor and our predecessor thereby ceased to exist 
since the exchange offer  we have engaged in four acquisitions 
in may  we acquired the assets of secureware sa  a french company for a combination of approximately million in our stock and cash 
in october  we acquired intellisoft corp 
for a combination of approximately million in our stock and cash distributed to dissenting shareholders 
this acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  therefore  all of our financial information has been restated to include the results of intellisoft 
in august  we acquired invincible data systems ids in a transaction which was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
a total of  shares were issued in the transaction 
our historical financial information was not restated for this transaction  which was deemed immaterial 
our latest acquisition was on march  when we acquired identikey ltd 
identikey  a privately held international security software company headquartered in brisbane  australia 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  more than percent of the outstanding capital stock of identikey was exchanged for  shares of company common stock  with potential additional earn out payments made in the form of additional shares which are based on defined performance incentives as specified in the purchase agreement 
this purchase was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the acquired assets have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets related to this transaction were  and are being amortized over a period of years 
overview we design  develop  market and support security products and services which manage and protect against unauthorized access to computer systems of corporate and governmental clients 
revenue and earnings 
we sell the majority of our products in european countries with significant sales in the united states  although we intend to actively pursue additional markets outside of europe  particularly south america  asia pacific  australia and the middle east 
revenues from sales from our digipass family  specifically the digipass and tokens  continue to represent the majority of our total revenues 
during and  digipass products accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
for  in excess of of the company s sales were comprised of security token devices 
although we believe it is likely that sales of the digipass family of tokens  which can be used on various platforms  will continue to account for a majority of our total revenues for the next few years  we also believe that revenues from sales of our other hardware and software data security products  including the vacman product line  will increase in the future 
research and development 
we are devoting substantial capital and other resources to enhancing our existing security products and developing new products to provide enterprise wide hardware and software security solutions 
costs of research and development  principally the design and development of hardware and software prior to the determination of technological feasibility  are expensed as incurred on a project by project basis 
our software capitalization policy currently defines technological feasibility as a functioning beta test prototype with confirmed manufacturability a working model  within a reasonably predictable range of costs 
additional criteria include receptive customers  or potential customers  as evidenced by interest expressed in a beta test prototype  at some suggested selling price 
variations in operating results 
our quarterly operating results have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly 
factors affecting operating results include the level of competition  the size  timing  cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  new product announcements or introductions by our competitors  adoption of new technologies and standards  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  component costs and availability  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  technological changes in the market for data security products  foreign currency exchange rates  and general economic trends and other factors 
in addition  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  long sales cycles due to the size of our contracts and the timing of when our customers take delivery of our products 
we also experience seasonality in our business 
these seasonal trends have included higher revenue in the last quarter of the calendar year and lower revenue in the next succeeding quarter 
we believe that revenue has tended to be higher in the last quarter due to the tendency of certain customers to implement or complete changes in computer or network security prior to the end of the calendar year 
in addition  revenue has tended to be lower in the summer months  particularly in europe  when many businesses defer purchase decisions 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
currency fluctuations 
the majority of our supply and sales transactions are denominated in us dollars  however  a significant portion of those transactions are denominated in various foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we attempt to match the timing of delivery  amount of product and the currency denomination of purchase orders received from vendors with sales orders to customers 
the financial position and results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates are included as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange transaction gains losses aggregating   and  are included in other non operating income expense for   and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of prepaid license fees  goodwill and other intangible assets  and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company assesses the recoverability of its software development costs against estimated future revenue for the individual products over the estimated remaining economic life of the software 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
given the highly competitive environment and technological changes  it is reasonably possible that estimates of anticipated future revenue  the remaining economic life of the company s software products  or both may be reduced significantly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk approximately of our business is conducted outside the united states  in europe and asia pacific 
a significant portion of our business operations are transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we are affected by both foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments 
translation adjustments result from the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets and income statements to us dollars at year end exchange rates and weighted average exchange rates  respectively 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded directly into stockholders equity 
transaction adjustments result from currency exchange movements when a foreign subsidiary transacts business in a currency that differs from its local currency 
these transactions are recorded as gains or losses in our statement of operations 
our foreign subsidiaries business transactions are spread across approximately different countries and currencies 
this geographic diversity reduces the risk to our operating results 
we have minimal interest rate risk 
our million long term debt has a fixed rate of  which is not subject to market fluctuations 
this note matures in september
