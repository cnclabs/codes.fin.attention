item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risk related to our business in item all forward looking statements included here are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed and offer non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that dramatically affects more than million men worldwide by causing adverse changes in urinary voiding patterns 
we market our products under the targis and prostatron names 
both systems utilize cooled thermotherapy  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and  as a result  can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph that is superior to medication without the complications and side effects inherent in clinically surgical procedures 
third party reimbursement is essential to acceptance of the cooled thermotherapy procedure 
we estimate that to of patients who receive treatment in the united states are eligible for medicare coverage  making medicare reimbursement critical for widespread market acceptance in the united states 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
the rate of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
through july   medicare had reimbursed hospitals on a reasonable cost basis for each cooled thermotherapy procedure performed 
under the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement  medicare reimbursed all reasonable costs the hospital incurred in conducting the procedures 
beginning august   the center for medicare and medicaid services cms  which administers medicare  replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this new method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each procedure performed in its facility 
medicare began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in a physician s office on a fixed rate basis on january  the change was a significant milestone  as it marked the first time patients were covered directly by medicare for in office cooled thermotherapy procedures 
we believe that this change in reimbursement allows cooled thermotherapy treatments to be performed in the environment the technology was designed to serve and will lead to increased demand for our products 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is to i increase market awareness of cooled thermotherapy  ii create access to cooled thermotherapy through both the sale and rental of cooled thermotherapy systems and iii increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses as we expand our marketing and sales activities  continue clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  and continue to invest in our effort to protect our intellectual property 
our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving market acceptance of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers and physicians offices and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies in accordance with recent securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment  net of estimated returns  which also are established at the time of shipment 
deferred revenue for warranty service contracts is recognized over the contract period 
revenue from equipment rental through our per procedure fee program is recognized at the time of treatment 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory reserves we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical experience and forecasted demand 
our reserve requirements could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million of trademarks 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical  due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
other intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer base and trademarks 
purchased technology and customer base are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
the trademark asset is considered to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  and it will not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
we review these definite and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal increased million or to million  compared to sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
the growth in revenue was fueled primarily by a increase in sales of single use treatment catheters 
revenue in fiscal was also positively affected by a full year of revenue from the prostatron product line  compared to nine months in fiscal we expect revenue in fiscal to increase as the sale of single use treatment catheters continues to grow and more physicians begin to use cooled thermotherapy 
sales increases in the domestic market will be partially offset by decreased international sales as reimbursement declines in japan adversely affect sales in that marketplace 
cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold resulted from an increase in the volume of cooled thermotherapy systems and single use treatment catheters sold in  partially offset by a reduction in the per unit production costs of our products  due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower product cost 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to continued manufacturing process improvements  increased production volumes  decreased raw material costs  price reductions from key suppliers  and a continued mix shift to the sale of our higher margin single use treatment catheters from cooled thermotherapy system sales 
research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in research and development expenses resulted from increased investments in new product development and clinical study activity 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue clinical trial activity on our next generation of cooled thermotherapy treatment catheters 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses resulted from the continued expansion of our direct sales force  training and promotion  and expenses related to a patent infringement suit that we filed to protect our intellectual property 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we expand our direct sales force  intensify our efforts to generate awareness and acceptance of cooled thermotherapy  and protect our intellectual property 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulted from the adoption of financial accounting standard board fasb statement  business combinations  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  these statements eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and the systematic amortization of goodwill 
we expect future annual amortization expense to be consistent with fiscal levels 
net interest income decreased to  during fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was attributable to lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances and lower average investment yields 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal increased million or to million  compared to sales of million in fiscal the growth in sales was the direct result of a favorable reimbursement change that allowed physicians to perform cooled thermotherapy procedures in their office  and approximately million increase in sales generated by the acquisition of the prostatron cooled thermotherapy product line from edap tms s 
a edap in october cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to higher sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to manufacturing process improvements  increased production volumes  decreased raw material costs and the elimination of royalties previously paid to edap 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased expenses were primarily attributable to the expansion of our direct sales force  investments in customer training  advertising and expenditures related to the integration of acquired prostatron products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the slight decrease in research and development expenses resulted from reduced clinical study activity offset by increased staffing 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million for fiscal the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of the purchase of the prostatron product line from edap in october net interest income decreased to  during fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances as well as higher interest expenses resulting from debt assumed in the edap product line acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy systems and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million and working capital of million 
during fiscal  we used cash of million in operating activities  primarily as a result of our net loss of million 
additionally  depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  were offset by increases in net accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other assets of  and inventories of  our investing activities generated million of cash in primarily resulting from the net sale of investment securities of million  offset by purchases of equipment of approximately million 
our financing activities generated proceeds of  during fiscal  reflecting million received through the issuance of common stock  offset by  in payments on capital lease obligations 
on october   we paid million in cash to edap in connection with the acquisition of edap s cooled thermotherapy product line  related patents and technologies 
this acquisition was funded through existing cash balances and the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
as part of the acquisition  we agreed to assume approximately million dollars in lease obligations related to control units located at customer sites within the united states and also issued a promissory note to pay edap  plus accrued interest on december  future contractual commitments that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands total fy fy acquired lease obligation  promissory note building lease total   we have no contractual commitments beyond fiscal year as of june   we did not have any significant purchase commitments 
we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the near future and will use our working capital as we incur expenses related to our sales  marketing  and research and development activities 
in addition  we plan to continue offering customers a per procedure rental program 
as of june  our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units under per procedure or rental agreements 
depending on the growth of this program  we may use substantial capital to finance the units rented by customers 
although we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of our financial investment portfolio at june   approximated carrying value 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward contracts and  therefore  do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
