item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 
because of the foregoing factors  you should not rely on past financial results as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and expect that our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at july   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million from july  we had working capital of million at july  compared to million at july  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended july  was approximately million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended july  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was due to the net change in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior year primarily inventory  accounts receivable and prepaid taxes 
net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately 
million from fiscal  primarily as a result of an decrease in capital expenditures and patent costs deferred 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million from fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net accounts receivable of million and million represented days and days of operating revenues at july  and  respectively 
the change in net accounts receivable is due to a decrease in accounts receivable at the clinical reference laboratory of approximately million and an increase of research products accounts receivable of approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in revenue from the clinical laboratory and the effect of the health maintenance organization contract that were cancelled in fiscal the company has entered into various real estate operating leases with both related and unrelated parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the total future payments under these contractual obligations as of july  is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     we believe that our current cash position is sufficient for our foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs  although there can be no assurance those future events will not alter such view 
management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual allowance  allowance for uncollectible accounts  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note the of consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than other accounting policies revenue recognition revenues from services from the clinical reference laboratory are recognized when services are provided 
the company s revenue is based on amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of contractual adjustments and other arrangements made with third party payors to provide services at less than established billing rates 
revenues from research product sales are recognized when the products are shipped 
contractual allowances the percentage of the company s revenues derived from medicare  third party payers  commercial insurers and managed care patients continue to increase 
the medicare regulations and various managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our clinical laboratory 
we estimate the allowance for contractual allowances on a payer specific basis given our interpretation of the applicable regulations and historical calculations 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for which primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since invoice date 
the company continually monitors its accounts receivable balances and utilizes cash collections data to support the basis for its estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payer mix or regulations could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not the benefits may not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the requirement to recognize impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
company management believes that no impairment to its long lived assets has occurred
