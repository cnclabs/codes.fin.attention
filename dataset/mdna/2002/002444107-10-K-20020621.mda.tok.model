item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during the fourth quarter of fiscal  customers began to experience a slow down in the rate of growth in demand for their products and determined that they had accumulated excess passive component inventory 
the utilization of the accumulated inventory and the decline in the worldwide economy  in particular  the impact on the telecommunication and data processing markets  have led to a significant decline in the demand for our products throughout fiscal during this period  the imbalance of the industry s production capacity and market demand has led to a decline in average selling prices for certain commodity related products 
reduced selling prices and low production levels have led to lower operating margins 
in reaction to the slow down in demand  the company has significantly reduced its labor force and operating costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded million of restructuring and special charges as part of its cost reduction initiative 
the company continu es to evaluate its cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with expected demand 
the company continues to invest in new products and improvements to the production processes and is committed to investing in research  development and engineering in order to provide our customers with new generations of passive component and connector product solutions 
we believe this philosophy will enable us to capitalize on improved market conditions and provide shareholder value 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationships to net sales of certain income statement items for the periods presented 
years ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss before income taxes net income loss outlook near term although the information available to us regarding our numerous customers inventory levels is limited  we believe the passive component inventories at electronic distributors  cems and oems was dramatically reduced during fiscal the near term results for the company will depend on the growth in the economy and the resulting expansion of the telecommunication  information technology hardware  automobile and other electronic markets 
our expectation is that  as these markets resume growth  our unit volumes will increase  but the continued imbalance in demand and capacity in the near term may lead to lower average selling prices for certain commodity related products 
higher sales volume and the resulting through put in the factories will reduce average production costs  but lower sales prices may mitigate a portion of the benefit 
page the majority of our commodity related ceramic capacitors are currently manufactured using nickel 
the company continues to use palladium metal in the manufacture of certain ceramic capacitors 
the palladium market has experienced dramatic price volatility over the past several years 
the company continues to offset the cost of palladium through conversion to the use of base metals 
we believe that our programs will continue to reduce  but not entirely eliminate  our use of palladium in the future 
due to the sudden and significant decrease in product demand and our ongoing conversion to nickel  palladium inventory levels have exceeded our forecasted quantity requirements 
accordingly  a portion of our palladium inventory was written down to net realizable value during fiscal future declines in palladium market prices will have an adverse effect on the carrying value of the remaining excess palladium inventory 
tantalum powder is a principal material used in the manufacture of solid tantalum capacitors 
the market for tantalum powder  which has historically been stable  experienced supply shortages and price volatility during fiscal during fiscal  in order to reduce the risk of interruption of supply  the company entered into a long term fixed contract for the supply of a portion of our anticipated annual material requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
prices under the contract exceed current market prices for tantalum powder 
if the forecasted tantalum capacitor demand does not develop or if average capacitor selling prices decline  the tantalum powder purchase commitment could lead to write offs of excess materials and adjustments to net realizable values 
long term we continue to be optimistic for opportunities of long term growth and profitability beginning in the second half of fiscal due to a the continued increase as a long term trend in worldwide demand for electronic components  b cost reductions and improvements in our production processes and c opportunities for growth in our advanced product line due to advances in component design 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  decreased to  million from  million for the year ended march  passive components sales during the year decreased to  million  while connector sales declined to million 
the decrease in revenue for both segments was attributable to the softening in demand across all markets  particularly the telecommunications and information technology hardware industries 
in addition  sales during the current period were also depressed as certain customers utilized their existing inventories in order to reduce quantities on hand 
the majority of our customers experienced a significant slow down in the demand for their products in early which resulted in excess passive component inventory in the industry wide supply chain 
the decline in sales was also a result of lower selling prices for certain commodity related products and the continuation of the trend toward smaller part sizes  which tradit ionally have lower average selling prices 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales in all regions had significant declines 
the decrease in demand had a greater effect on domestic sales as customers continue to shift production capability to asia 
accordingly  sales in north america decreased from of total sales for fiscal to of total sales for fiscal page gross profit for the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  despite a reduction in operating expenses  reduced sales  reduced selling prices and lower manufacturing volumes resulting in reduced cost absorption negatively impacted gross profit in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales 
in addition  higher costs for raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  contributed to the higher cost of sales 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by special charges totaling million  primarily relating to inventory write downs for precious metals  obsolete raw materials and finished goods 
the inventory charges are a result of excess quantities on hand due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and reductions in the net realizable value of such inventory 
we currently do not anticipate the inventory subject to the charges will be used at a later date based up on foreseeable demand 
the company continues to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and shifting production to low labor cost areas such as eastern europe and the far east 
as part of the company s cost reduction programs  we have shifted the majority of our production of commodity related multi layer ceramic capacitors from palladium to base metals  such as nickel 
during the year ended march   the company recorded million of restructuring expense as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce operating costs and reorganize its operations in light of the economic downturn 
the restructuring costs included million for employee severance and benefit costs and million for passive component manufacturing and warehousing facility consolidations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the year ended march  the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses  in absolute terms  is primarily due to lower sales commissions to independent manufacturers representatives million  the reduction in administrative staff headcount and operating expenses million  and lower research and development costs million 
the expenses for the year ended march  include a million special charge for doubtful customers receivables 
the economic environment led to the receivables due from a few smaller customers to be significantly past due and determined to be uncollectable 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these costs are reflected in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses on the income statement 
the costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations for the year ended march  was million compared to a profit of million for the year ended march  for the reasons set forth above  higher income tax expenses due to the nondeductability of losses for certain european operations offset in part by higher interest income on invested cash  the net loss for the year ended march  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended march  page year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  increased to  million from  million for the year ended march  passive components sales during the year increased to  million 
increased average selling prices due to demand outpacing supply  coupled with additional units sold and a richer product mix  contributed to the sales growth 
although sales of all product groups increased  ceramic and tantalum surface mount products and advanced products contributed heavily to the growth 
connector sales during the year increased to million 
gross profit for the year ended march  increased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  the improvement in gross profit in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales can be attributed to the favorable pricing environment 
gross profit was also positively impacted by sales of a richer mix of product that traditionally have higher selling prices and margin 
gross profit continued to be negatively impacted by the cost of palladium  currently a raw material used in the manufacture of certain multi layer ceramic capacitors 
the price we paid for palladium purchased during the year ended march  exceeded the price we paid for an equivalent amount purchased during the prior year by approximately million 
the company continued to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and shifting production to low labor cost areas such as eastern europe and the far east 
as part of the company s c ost reduction programs  we have shifted the majority of our production of commodity related multi layer ceramic capacitors from palladium to base metals  such as nickel 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the year ended march  the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  was a result of higher sales 
the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to higher sales commissions million increase 
other contributing factors included increases in research and development costs  charitable contributions  goodwill amortization and various selling and administrative costs 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these costs are presented in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses on the income statement 
the costs were incurred as we continued to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  profit from operations for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  the results for the year ended march  include in other income a benefit of million as a result of a settlement for defective materials from a supplier and a million gain from the sale of a non operating asset 
for the reasons set forth above and higher interest income on invested cash  net income for the year ended march  increased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  page financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds 
as of march   we had a current ratio of to  million of cash  cash equivalents and long term investments   million of stockholders equity and an insignificant amount of debt 
net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended march   million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures related to expanding the production capabilities of the passive component and connector product lines  as well as the implementation of lower cost manufacturing processes 
the carrying value for our equipment reflects the fact that depreciation expense for machinery and equipment is generally computed using the accelerated double declining balance method 
we continue to add additional capacity for advanced and specialty products and expect to incur capital expenditures at or near fiscal levels during fiscal during fiscal  we purchased a interest in the research and development company  electro chemical research ltd 
ecr 
we made a further investment of million in may for an additional interest in ecr 
we currently own of ecr s outstanding shares 
ecr has developed and patented a technology for high capacity electrical storage devices 
although the majority of our funding is internally generated  certain of our european subsidiaries have from time to time borrowed german deutsche marks  french francs and euros under various bank agreements 
at march   outstanding balances under such agreements totaled million 
these borrowings have been used for regional working capital requirements and to repay other outstanding obligations 
in fiscal  and dividends of million  million and million  respectively  were paid to stockholders 
pursuant to a previously authorized stock repurchase program  we were authorized to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
we purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal and purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal on april   the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market 
under this program we purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes 
we have established reserves for our projected share of costs associated with the remediation of  and compliance with  environmental matters at various sites 
adjustments to such provisions and related expenditures have not been material in any of the years ended march   or based on our financial condition as of march   we believe that cash on hand and expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  environmental clean up costs  research  development and engineering expenses  any dividends and any stock repurchases during the next year

the company does not anticipate any significant changes in its ability to generate or meet its liquidity needs in the long term 
page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  goodwill  restructuring costs  income taxes and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumst ances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition all of our products are built to specification and tested by avx for adherence to such specification before shipment to customers 
the company ships products to customers based upon firm orders 
revenue is recognized upon transfer of title of the products and assessment of collectability 
certain sales to distributors are under terms that allow the company to grant price protection to such distributors for actual sales at prices below anticipated sales prices 
a portion of sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing limited rights of return within a six month period 
the company provides an allowance for distributor adjustments based on historical experience and managements estimates of the potential impact of the economic climate 
the company s revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accounts receivable we report provisions for distributors adjustments as a reduction in revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expenses 
we review specific accounts for collectability based upon circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based upon historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based upon historical discounts  concessions  bad debts  customer concentrations  changes in customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
during fiscal  the company recognized a million special charge for doubtful customers receivables  as the economic environment caused the receivables due from a few smaller customers to be significantly past due and determined to be uncollectable 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the valuation of inventory requires the company to estimate net realizable value 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or the lesser of cost or market value 
during the year ended march   the company recorded a million charge for the write down of palladium 
palladium  a precious metal currently used in the manufacture of a small portion of our multi layer ceramic capacitors  is purchased in the form of palladium sponge or ingot 
due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and the ongoing conversion to base metal production  palladium inventory levels exceeded our foreseeable demand 
future declines in palladium prices will have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our remaining excess raw material inventory 
page tantalum powder is a principal material used in the manufacture of solid tantalum capacitors 
a portion of our annual material requirement is purchased under long term fixed contracts at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment 
if forecasted demand does not develop or average capacitor selling prices decline  the purchase commitments could lead to write offs of excess materials and adjustments to net realizable values 
property and equipment and other assets property and equipment are recorded at cost 
machinery and equipment are generally depreciated on the double declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and goodwill  are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the discounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
restructuring during fiscal  we recorded charges in connection with restructuring and facility consolidations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at the date we approve a restructuring plan and satisfy other required criteria  we establish a liability for the estimated costs associated with that restructuring plan 
until the plan activities are completed  the actual cost may differ from our estimate 
we use judgments and information available to us at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate our initial estimate of the plan costs 
if circumstances change and our previous estimates are no longer accurate  we adjust the reserve with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
with any establishment of a valuation allowance  or increases to the allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
page the company has recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
contingencies we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the united states and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate 
based on our periodic review of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities  we believe that our operations currently comply  in all material respects  with all of these laws and regulations 
regarding sites identified by the epa at which remediation is required  the company s ultimate liability in connection with environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of non environmentally safe waste  the total cost of remediation and the financial viability of other companies having liability 
once it becomes probable that the company will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated  the company establishes or adjusts its reserves for its projected share of these costs 
these reserves do no t reflect any possible future insurance recoveries  which are not expected to be significant  but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites 
based upon information known to the company concerning the size of these sites  their years of operation and the number of past users  management believes that it has adequate reserves with respect to these matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency our european sales  which accounted for approximately of fiscal sales  generally are denominated in local currencies  while those in north america and asia generally are denominated in us dollars 
also  certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in europe  asia  mexico and central and south america 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and cash flow 
in order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates  we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange gains and losses have been immaterial during the periods presented 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in all european currencies against the us dollar  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  the resulting net loss would have an estimated million impact on income before income taxes 
materials we are at risk to fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture our products  primarily palladium and tantalum 
palladium  a precious metal currently used in the manufacture of a small portion of our multi layer ceramic capacitors  is primarily purchased from various companies in the form of palladium sponge and ingot 
the main areas of mining of palladium are in russia and south africa 
palladium is considered a commodity and is subject to price volatility and has fluctuated in a range of approximately to  per troy ounce during the past three years 
the market price was per troy ounce at march  we have addressed our use of palladium by i adjusting the manufacturing process for the parts made with palladium to reduce the amount of the precious metal used in each part  and ii substituting base metals  such as nickel  in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors 
the majority of our produced commodity related ceramic capacitors are currently manufactured using nickel 
the company accumulated palladium inventories during the prior fiscal year based upon customer forecasted demand 
due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and the ongoing conversion to nickel  palladium inventory levels exceeded our forecasted quantity requirements 
as a result  the company recorded a write down of excess raw material to net realizable value during fiscal future declines in palladium prices will have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our remaining excess palladium inventory 
tantalum powder is a principal material used in the manufacture of solid tantalum capacitors 
this product is purchased under contracts through suppliers from various parts of the world at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment 
a portion of our annual material requirement is purchased under long term fixed contracts at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment 
tantalum ore prices have fluctuated in a range of to per pound during the last three years 
the market price was approximately per pound at march  if forecasted demand does not develop or if average capacitor selling prices decline  the purchase commitments could lead to write offs of excess materials and adjustments to net realizable values
