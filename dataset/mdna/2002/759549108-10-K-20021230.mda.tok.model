the percentage of gross profit paid to the licensee is generally based on the level of hours billed during the contract year 
as of september   there were independently managed franchise offices operating as traditional franchises and operating as licensed franchise offices 
in general  franchise offices opened from to are operated as traditional franchises  and independently managed offices opened since are operated as licensed franchise offices 
the company moved from the traditional to the licensed franchise format to exercise more control over the collection and tracking of the receivables generated by the independently managed offices and to allow the company to grow without being limited by the financial resources of traditional franchisees 
accordingly  the number of traditional franchise offices is not anticipated to increase  except in certain circumstances when a licensed franchise office may convert to the traditional franchise format 
additionally  existing traditional franchisees have the option under their contract to open new franchise offices within their territory 
the number of licensed franchise offices is expected to increase because new independently managed offices will be opened in licensed franchise format and offices currently operated as traditional franchises may  depending upon various factors  convert to the licensed franchise format 
if the number of traditional franchise offices is reduced  royalty revenues will decrease

the company is self insured for its deductible liability  per individual claim incurred from april  to march  and  for all subsequent claims 
however  should any single occurrence exceed the applicable deductible amount per occurrence  all incremental losses and expenses would be paid by the applicable insurance carrier

critical accounting policies the discussions and analyses of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations were based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company s management reviews and evaluates these estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and a variety of other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of remedy s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company accounts for the revenues and the related direct costs in accordance emerging issues task force reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company is required to assess whether it acts as a principal in its transactions or as an agent acting on the behalf of others 
where the company is the principal in a transaction and has the risks and rewards of ownership  the transaction is recorded gross in the income statement  and where the company acts merely as an agent  only the net fees earned are recorded in the income statement 
under the company s traditional franchised agreement  the franchisee has the direct contractual relationship with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  the company does not include the revenues and direct expenses from these transactions in its income statement and only records the royalty fee earned 
alternatively  under the company s licensed franchise agreements the company has the direct contractual relationship with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
as the company retains the risks and rewards of ownership such as the liability for the cost of temporary personnel and the risk of loss for collection  the revenues and direct expenses of its licensed franchise operations are included in the company s results of operations 
the company remits to each licensed franchisee a portion of the gross margin generated by its office s 
accounts receivable remedy provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based upon management s analysis of historical write off levels  current economic trends  routine assessment of its customers financial strength and any other known factors impacting collectibility 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
remedy s estimates are influenced by the following considerations the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of its net sales and its continuing credit evaluation of its customers financial conditions 
workers compensation costs the company maintains reserves for its workers compensation obligations using actuarial methods to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of all claims  including those incurred but not reported 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
the calculated ultimate liability is then reduced by cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserve 
management evaluates the reserve  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets management assesses potential impairment of the company s goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
when the sum of the expected  undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset  an impairment loss will be recognized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets see note to consolidated financial statements  the company will no longer amortize goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets effective the beginning of fiscal instead  these assets will be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
amortization expense was million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
may have on its consolidated financial position and it is expected that the company will record a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  as necessary 
impairment  under sfas no 
 is based on the valuation of individual reporting units 
the valuation methods used include estimated net present value of projected future cash flows of these reporting units 
if actual results are substantially lower  or if market discount rates increase  this could adversely affect the valuations and may result in additional future impairment charges 
income taxes in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management estimates the company s income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
this includes estimating the company s actual current tax expense together with any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management is required to assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be provided 
based upon its current estimates of future taxable income  management believes its recorded deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been provided 
contingencies and litigation there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against the company incident to its operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  the company must record the amount of the estimated liability 
based on current available information  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  management will continue assessing any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise its estimates 
new accounting standards see note to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its clients businesses 
the first fiscal quarter has historically been strong as a result of manufacturing and retail emphasis on holiday sales 
historically  the second fiscal quarter shows a slight decline in comparable revenues from the first fiscal quarter 
revenue growth has historically accelerated in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters as manufacturers  retailers and service businesses increase their level of business activity 
inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of its investments 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve  assuming all other factors remain constant  would not materially affect the fair value of the company s interest sensitive financial instruments at september  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income
