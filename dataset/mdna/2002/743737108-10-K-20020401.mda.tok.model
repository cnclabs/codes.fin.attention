item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications signals  and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation and amortization  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management were to take specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international  national and regional economic conditions 
third  the volume of capitalized track or recollectable projects performed by the company s maintenance of way and communications signals departments can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses 
the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses  and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year 
one of the company s customers  tilcon connecticut  inc  which ships construction aggregate from three separate quarries on the company s system to asphalt production plants in connecticut and new york  accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in   and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to substantially offset the decrease in operating revenues

the company is party to an arbitration proceeding with the national railroad passenger corporation amtrak concerning amtrak s claim for rate increases with respect to the company s freight operations over a portion of amtrak s northeast corridor in the states of rhode island and connecticut 
on july  amtrak filed its brief in the arbitration in which amtrak claims that it is entitled to approximately million under its contract with the company  of which million relates to the period from july through june the company believes that  pursuant to its contract with amtrak  amtrak s claim for the period ended june is without merit 
as to amtrak s claim for the period from july to date  totaling  the company believes that amtrak s allocated expenses are overstated and that amtrak s entitlement  if any  to increased mileage charges would be significantly less than the amount claimed

the company filed its brief on november  discovery has ended  and a hearing before the arbitrator is scheduled for march   with a decision to follow sometime thereafter 
given the extent of the differences in the positions of the parties  the company cannot predict the amount  if any  of any liability to amtrak which may result from this arbitration 
on january   the company received a notice of potential liability from the united states environmental protection agency epa regarding an existing superfund site that includes the jm mills landfill in cumberland  rhode island 
epa sends these notice letters to potentially responsible parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
epa identified the company as a prp based on its status as an owner and or operator because its railroad property traverses the superfund site 
via these notice letters  epa makes a demand for payment of past costs identified in the letter as  and future costs associated with the response actions taken to address the contamination at the site  and requests prps to indicate their willingness to participate and resolve their potential liability at the site 
the company has responded to epa by stating that it does not believe it has any liability for this site  but that it is interested in cooperating with epa to address issues concerning liability at the site 
at this point  two other parties have already committed via a consent order with epa to pay for the remedial investigation feasibility study phase of the clean up at the site  which will take approximately two or more years to complete 
after that  epa will likely seek to negotiate the cost of the remedial design and implementation of the remedy at the site with the prps it has identified via these notice letters which presently includes over fifty parties  and is likely to increase after epa completes its investigation of the identity of prps 
the company believes that none of its activities caused contamination at the site  and will contest this claim by epa 
land held for development pursuant to permits issued by the united states department of the army corp of engineers ace and the rhode island coastal resources management council crmc  the company created acres of waterfront land in east providence  rhode island south quay originally designed to capitalize on the growth of intermodal transportation utilizing rail  water and highway connections 
the property has good highway access mile from i and direct rail access and is adjacent to a acre site also owned by the company 
the permits for the property allow for construction of a dock along the west face of the south quay

the company has been cooperating with the city of east providence in these efforts 
in connection with the preparation by the ace of the final environmental impact statement feis for the dredging of the providence river  the company was approached about its willingness to accept up to  cubic yards of dredged materials for de watering on the south quay property  with the understanding that  following the de watering  the company would be free to use the material for its own purposes 
the feis  dated august  identified the south quay as one of two potential temporary sites for dewatering and storage or reuse of high quality sand and gravel that would be excavated and went on to note that the identified sites would be able to take only a portion of the dredged material 
the company is pursuing this course in the belief that additional clean  buildable fill  if available  could further enhance the value of the site 
in addition  the company is considering a proposal to develop the site to provide freight service for the transport of automobiles along the company s main line to and from east providence  pending the development of the quonset point davisville industrial park
