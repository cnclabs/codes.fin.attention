item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview simple technology  inc  incorporated in and renamed simpletech  inc 
in may  is a technology solutions provider offering products based on dram  sram and flash memory technologies 
headquartered in santa ana  california  the company is a leader in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of memory solutions 
in addition  we offer a line of high density memory products using our three dimensional ic tower stacking technology that allows multiple memory chips to be stacked together to increase the capabilities of memory modules without increasing the product footprint 
our products are used in high performance computing  networking and communications  consumer electronics and industrial applications 
as a result of increased demand for consumer electronics and high density memory products used in internet infrastructure and embedded applications  the percentage of our revenues derived from the sale of flash memory and ic tower stacking products increased from in to in and in however  due to the softening macro economic conditions and excess inventory levels at our industrial division customers in  the percentage of our revenue derived from the sale of flash memory and ic tower stacking products decreased to in in  our highest profit margin products were our ic tower stacking products 
we sell our products through our industrial and commercial divisions 
our industrial division was created in late to enhance the marketing of our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
our commercial division sells our products through the following five channels value added reseller  or var  mail order  commercial and industrial distribution  and retail 
for further details on our major customers  see business customers 
after experiencing year over year total revenue growth of from to and from to  both our industrial and commercial division revenues were negatively impacted in due to softening macro economic conditions and severe declines in the price of dram and flash components  which resulted in significantly lower average selling prices 
in addition  our industrial division revenues were further impacted by a build up of inventory by our communications and networking customers in we do not expect industrial division customer inventory levels to return to normal levels until at least the second half of in  our industrial division revenues declined and our commercial division revenues declined 
our total revenues and earnings bottomed in the third quarter of with total revenues growing sequentially in the fourth quarter of in  our commercial division significantly expanded our retail presence through the addition of new customers  including sam s club and circuit city 
commercial division units shipped increased from to in and  our highest profit margin division was our industrial division 
although we began tracking revenues and gross margins on a divisional basis in  we have not tracked  and do not intend to track  operating expenses on a divisional basis 
dram prices have more than quadrupled from november to march and appear to have temporarily stabilized 
constraint measures enacted by suppliers during the second half of  including the closing of fab lines and consolidation among major dram manufacturers  have contributed to rising dram prices and signs of recovery 
we believe these events will translate into increased average selling prices  revenues and gross profit dollars 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in  and of our total revenues in our ten largest industrial division customers accounted for an aggregate of of our industrial division revenues or of our total revenues in  of our industrial division revenues or of our total revenues in  and of our industrial revenues or of our total revenues in in  unisys accounted for of our industrial division revenues or of our total revenues 
in  cisco systems accounted for of our industrial division revenues or of our total revenues 
our ten largest commercial division customers accounted for an aggregate of of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in  of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in  and of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in our largest commercial division customer between and  cdw computer centers accounted for of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in  of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in and of our commercial division revenues or of our total revenues in other than unisys and cdw computer centers in  cisco systems and cdw computer centers in and cdw computer centers in  no customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in  or the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our customers products changes and we expect this variability will continue in the future 
we expect that sales of our products to a small number of customers will continue to contribute materially to our revenues in the foreseeable future and believe that our financial results will depend in significant part upon the success of our customers products 
international sales of our products constituted of our revenues in  of our revenues in and of our revenues in no single foreign country accounted for more than of our revenues in  or we focus our international sales efforts on industrial and commercial division customers  with sales to vars constituting substantially all of our international commercial sales 
in  and  over of our international sales were denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive  which could result in a reduction of sales in a particular country 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of the ic devices used in our products from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
although our purchases of ic devices are currently denominated in us dollars  devaluation of the us dollar relative to the currency of a foreign supplier would likely result in an increase in our cost of ic devices 
our international sales also could be adversely affected by risks including regulatory risks  tariffs and other trade barriers 
in the past we have been impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns resulting in higher sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
our ability to adjust our short term operating expenses in response to fluctuations in revenues is limited 
as a result  if revenues are lower than expected in any given period  our results of operations could be harmed 
revenues are recognized at the time of shipment 
a majority of our sales through commercial channels include limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers 
product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues 
we have had to write down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence  excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs 
these inventory write downs were approximately  in  million in and million in increased inventory write downs in were primarily attributable to sharp declines in component prices during the fourth quarter 
we also have price protection agreements with a number of our commercial division customers in which we retain limited liability for price declines related to unsold inventory 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive credits from us 
we incurred price protection charges of approximately million in   in and  in price protection charges increased in due to increased component price volatility 
from our formation in march through september   we elected for federal and state income tax purposes to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of and comparable state tax laws and filed our federal and state income tax returns during that period on that basis 
subsequent to our s corporation termination on september   we have paid federal and state corporate level income taxes as a c corporation 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data reflected as a percentage of revenues

net income 

pro forma in and comparison of the years ended december   and net revenues 
our revenues were million in  million in and million in sales of memory products accounted for of our revenues in  of our revenues in and of our revenues in revenues decreased from to primarily due to a decrease in our average sales price from in to in  offset partially by a increase in units shipped from million units in to million units in the decrease in our average sales price resulted from significant declines in dram and flash component prices from october through november the increase in unit volume resulted from increases of for standard memory products and for flash products  partially offset by unit volume decreases of for ic tower stacking products and for non dram  non flash products such as sram  hard drive upgrade kits and connectivity products 
increases in flash and standard memory units shipped resulted primarily from market share gains achieved during in the retail channel  including shipments to new retail customers such as circuit city and sam s club 
decreases in ic tower stacking units shipped resulted from excess industrial division customer inventory levels throughout the mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future  affecting our overall average sales prices and gross margins 
revenues increased from to due to a increase in our average sales price from in to in and a increase in unit volume from million units in to million units in the increase in our average sales price resulted from a shift in product mix to higher capacity dram  flash and ic tower stacking products 
the increase in unit volume resulted from unit volume increases of for ic tower stacking products and for flash products  partially offset by unit volume decreases of for standard memory products and for non dram  non flash products such as products manufactured on a consignment basis  sram  hard drive upgrade kits and connectivity products 
the decrease in unit volume for non dram  non flash products resulted from a substantial decline in the unit volume of products manufactured on a consignment basis from to our industrial division revenues were million in  million in and million in  compared to our commercial division revenues of million in  million in and million in both our industrial and commercial division revenues were negatively impacted in due to softening macro economic conditions and severe declines in the price of dram and flash components  which resulted in significantly lower average selling prices 
our industrial division revenues were further impacted by a build up of inventory by our communications and networking customers in we do not expect industrial division customer inventory levels to return to normal levels until at least the second half of our combined backlog was million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  our industrial division backlog was million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december   compared to our commercial division backlog of  as of december   million as of december  and  as of december  from to  the decrease in industrial division backlog resulted from a build up of inventory by our industrial division customers  which led to a significant reduction of orders 
from to  the increase in industrial division backlog was primarily due to increasing industrial division orders and the lengthening of time between our receipt of an industrial division order and the required ship date of the order 
commercial division backlog is typically nominal since substantially all commercial orders are filled on a same day or next day basis 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million in  million in and million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat from to gross profit as a percentage of revenues expanded from to primarily due to a shift in product mix to a greater concentration of higher margin  higher capacity flash memory and ic tower stacking products 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our industrial division was in  in and in  compared to our commercial division gross profit as a percentage of revenues of in  in and in gross margins for our industrial division were greater than for our commercial division primarily due to the fact that our industrial division sold a larger percentage of higher margin  higher capacity dram  flash memory and ic tower stacking products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of personnel costs and travel expenses for our domestic and international sales and marketing employees  commissions paid to internal salespersons and independent manufacturers representatives  shipping costs and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in sales and marketing expenses decreased from to primarily due to reduced commissions and channel marketing expenses related to lower revenues 
sales and marketing expenses increased from to primarily due to increases in personnel costs related to the addition of internal salespersons and increased commissions and channel marketing expenses related to higher revenues 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from to primarily due to reduced revenues and were relatively flat in and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of personnel costs for our executive and administrative employees  professional fees and facilities overhead 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were relatively flat between and general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily due to increased staffing and million in additional legal costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily due to reduced revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to primarily due to increased revenues  partially offset by increased legal costs and expanded staffing 
research and development 
research and development expenses are comprised primarily of personnel costs for our engineering and design staff and the cost of prototype supplies 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in research and development expenses increased year over year from to primarily due to a significant expansion of our research and development staff to serve our growing industrial division customer base and to develop new product lines 
in january  we completed a million acquisition of the assets  including intellectual property  of irvine networks  llc  and hired their engineering staff 
irvine networks has been developing innovative content processing technology for web based server platforms 
as a result of our acquisition of irvine networks  we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in to approximately to million 
non recurring expenses 
we did not have non recurring expenses in and in non recurring expenses were million in and were comprised of expenses related to a litigation settlement with interactive flight technologies  inc the settlement payment was made in january interest and other expense income  net 
interest and other expense income  net is comprised of interest expense related to our line of credit and equipment financing  interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and other expenses or income resulting from non operating transactions 
interest and other expense income  net was million in  million in and million in interest expense was  in  million in and million in in october  we paid down our line of credit balance to zero 
interest income was million in   in and  in interest income increased in and due to a higher average cash balance resulting primarily from initial public offering proceeds received in october and positive cash flow from operations in each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of in  we contributed land with a cost basis of  to charity resulting in other expense 
net income 
net income was million in assuming the termination of our s corporation status  pro forma net income would have been million in and million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents  as of december  we had no outstanding principal balance under our million line of credit with comerica bank at december  and there is no unused line fee under our line of credit agreement with comerica bank 
following our initial public offering  comerica bank has the option to reduce our availability under the line of credit to an amount between million and million as determined by their sole and absolute discretion 
to date  availability under our line of credit has remained at million 
current assets were times current liabilities at the end of  compared to times current liabilities at the end of net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of million  a decrease in net accounts receivable of million and a decrease in net inventory of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
inventory and accounts payable decreased primarily due to the implementation of consignment inventory programs with our three largest component suppliers during and a sharp decline in dram and flash pricing during the year 
accounts receivable decreased due to the decline in overall revenues 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of million  increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of million  and depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by increases in net inventory of million  net accounts receivable of million and deferred income taxes of million 
inventory increased to support increased industrial division customer orders and lengthened time between our receipt of such orders and their required ship date 
accounts receivable increased due to increased overall revenues 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in  attributable primarily to purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
although we had no material capital expense commitments as of december   we expect to spend approximately to million during the next months  primarily for manufacturing  testing and engineering equipment 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  in net cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the repayment of borrowings from a bank and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million related to our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
in  we also repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program at an average price of approximately per share  resulting in a total cash payment of approximately  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the receipt of million in connection with our initial public offering in september  partially offset by distributions of million to s corporation shareholders and line of credit repayments of million 
in prior years  we entered into several capital leases and loans to finance manufacturing and testing equipment 
our obligations under capital leases were  on december  and million on december   with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
our equipment financing loan balances were million on december  and million on december   with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
one of the equipment note payable agreements contains various nonfinancial covenants that  among other things  limit distributions and dividends to our shareholders without the prior written consent of the lender  and requires the equipment to remain unencumbered by other liens 
as of december  we were in compliance with all covenants under the equipment note payable agreements 
we have made cash distributions of a portion of our s corporation earnings to our shareholders of record as of september   for reasons including payment of their overall personal income taxes 
on september   we distributed to our shareholders of record as of september   in proportion to their ownership of our shares  notes in an aggregate principal amount of million  equal to our undistributed earnings from the date of our formation through september  we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to payoff the principal amount of these undistributed earnings notes on october  and november we believe the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our existing assets  availability under our line of credit and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional sources of funds to continue to support our business 
such funds  if needed  may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the past three fiscal years ended december   and subsequent events in january  we completed a million acquisition of the assets  including intellectual property  of irvine networks  llc  and hired their engineering staff 
the on going operation has become our xiran division 
for the past two and a half years  irvine networks has been developing innovative content processing technology for web based server platforms 
the effort is in the final stages of developing a working prototype 
the completed products  incorporating our patented memory stacking technology  will be inserted into web based servers to enable the faster transmission of files 
recently issued accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  requires that long lived assets to be disposed by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell and expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that a can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and b will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  and is therefore effective for us beginning with our fiscal quarter ending march  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for inventory excess  obsolescence and lower of market values over costs we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy and customer demand  and the somewhat unpredictable fluctuations in market values for such materials  however  can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
allowances for doubtful accounts and price protection we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additionally  we maintain allowances for limited price protection rights for inventories of our products held by our customers as a result of recent sales transactions to them 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive a credit from us 
we estimate the impact of such pricing changes on a regular basis and adjust our allowances accordingly 
product returns we offer a majority of our customers that purchase product through our commercial channels limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relationships with our customers 
we provide for estimated future returns of inventory at the time of sale based on historical experience and actual results have been within our expectations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense maybe recorded 
litigation and other contingencies management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  our management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements regarding recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our existing variable rate debt 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million and our variable rate debt  consisting of term loan borrowing  was million 
we have not utilized our floating rate debt under the revolving credit facility since october at december   our cash and cash equivalents included million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts and million invested in marketable securities  which represents investments in united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
at december   our investment in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent united states treasury notes and treasury bonds with a maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
maturities on held to maturity marketable debt securities range from three months to two years 
if interest rates were to decrease  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  conversely  if interest rates were to increase  the result would be an annual increase in our interest expense related to our variable rate debt of approximately  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
more than of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of our ic devices from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
fluctuations in the currencies of japan  korea or taiwan could have an adverse impact on the cost of our raw materials 
to date  we have not entered any derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rates
