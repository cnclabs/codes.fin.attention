item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes to those state ments included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we design  manufacture  market and service switching and networking prod ucts for storage and data networks 
our products provide fast and reliable connections among networks of computers and related devices  allowing custom ers to manage and expand large  complex storage networks efficiently  without geographic limitations 
we serve fortune businesses and other large en terprises that operate large scale systems where reliability and continuous availability are critical 
inrange s core to edge to anywhere solutions solve the growing data storage challenges facing it organizations  while pro viding investment protection and a proven foundation for future growth 
our flagship product  the fc  is the most scalable storage networking director class switch available for storage area networks sans 
with an ability for customers to upgrade and scale to ports without disrupting ex isting systems  the fc provides a platform from which enterprises can build storage networks that can be used in systems where reliability and con tinuous availability are critical 
our products are designed to be compatible with various vendors products and multiple communication standards and proto cols 
we distribute and support our products through a combination of our di rect sales and service operations and indirect channels 
following our acquisition by spx and beginning in the fourth quarter of  we implemented several initiatives to rationalize revenue  streamline operations and improve profitability 
as part of this process  we discontinued sales of non strategic  low volume product lines and products that were at the end of their life cycles 
we also closed two manufacturing facilities and con solidated all of our operations into one manufacturing location  consolidated duplicative selling and administration functions into one location  and re duced headcount in non strategic areas 
these actions were substantially com pleted by july in connection with these initiatives  we recorded special charges of million in and million in in june  we acquired two european distribution businesses  tcs and sti 
these acquisitions expanded our direct sales and customer service pres ence in france  switzerland  belgium and luxembourg 
on august   we ac quired selected assets of varcom corporation  a provider of advanced local area network and wide area network monitoring and management tools 
as a re sult of the varcom acquisition  we recorded a write off of in process technol ogy of million 
on august   we acquired substantially all of the assets of computerm corporation 
computerm is a provider of storage area net work channel extension products 
the aggregate purchase price for these three acquisitions was million  subject to purchase price adjustments 
the purchase price adjustments relating to the computerm and varcom acquisitions were finalized in of this amount  million was paid at the closing of the acquisitions and up to million is payable at specified dates if we have not made claims against the sellers by those dates 
we have accounted for all three acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
on january   we completed the acquisition of prevail technology 
prevail  located in waltham  massachusetts  provides professional services with expertise in designing and implementing high availability solutions for it infrastructures and e business environments 
on may   we completed the acquisition of onex  incorporated 
onex  located in indianapolis  indiana  is a technology consulting company that designs mission critical network in frastructure and implements e business and enterprise resource planning solu tions 
in september  we completed the acquisition of eb networks 
eb net works  located in parsippany  new jersey  is noted for its expertise in design and support services for enterprise network infrastructures 
the aggregate purchase price for these three acquisitions was million  subject to pur chase price adjustments 
of this amount  million was paid at the closing of the acquisitions and up to million is payable at specified dates 
we have accounted for all three acquisitions using the purchase method of ac counting 
in  we decided to focus on our storage networking business and an nounced in the second and fourth quarters that we would restructure the opera tions 
in connection with these decisions  we recorded restructuring  special and asset impairment charges that totaled million 
the restructuring and special charges primarily include severance  lease abandonment costs and the settlement of contractual obligations from a discontinued product totaling million 
the asset impairment charges totaled million and included the write off of goodwill related to an acquisition completed in  the write down of investments made in certain business partners and asset write downs associated with discontinued product lines 
in addition  we recorded in ventory write offs totaling million as a component of cost of sales 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business opera tions and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is dis cussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where these policies affect our reported and ex pected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consoli dated financial statements 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that our ac tual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commis sions and royalties 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products with stan dard configurations 
revenue from products with other than standard configura tions is recognized upon customer acceptance or when all of the terms of the sales agreement have been fulfilled 
amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in revenue and the related costs are included in cost of revenue 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns  and other allowances at the time of shipment based on our experience 
revenue from service obligations associ ated with maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the contracts 
other service revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
accounts receivable 
we sell products and services to a large number of customers in various industries and geographical areas 
our trade accounts re ceivable are exposed to credit risk  however  the risk is limited due to the general diversity of our customer base 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain reserves for potential bad debt losses 
capitalized software research and development costs 
our policy on capital ized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain devel opment costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classi fied as development expense or cost of revenues 
costs incurred in the re search and development of new software included in products are charged to ex pense as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
after tech nological feasibility is established  additional costs are capitalized in ac cordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 ac counting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  until the product is available for general release 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related products and the amortization is included in cost of revenue 
we perform a pe riodic review of the recoverability of these capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable product  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories on hand in clude the cost of materials  freight  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inven tory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an in crease in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolesence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
income taxes 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary dif ferences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines re garding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected operat ing data as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue gross margin research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative operating income loss net income loss comparison of years ended december  and the terrorist events of september  adversely impacted our results of operations for the third quarter and the full year of  although we cannot quantify the amount of the impact 
revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  no single customer represented greater than ten percent of total revenue in or in  sales to international customers in creased to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenues in revenues attributable to direct channels to taled million and million in and  respectively 
sales of our open storage networking products were million  an in crease of million  or from million in the year ended decem ber  our open storage networking products consist of fibre channel directors and optical networking equipment as well as related services for these products 
the increase was driven primarily by sales of the fc di rector  which was released for general availability during the third quarter of revenues from our virtual storage networking products  which consist of our remote disk mirroring  channel extension and business continuance prod ucts  were million  an increase of million or from the year ended december  in addition  product revenues from our legacy busi nesses and our divested telecommunications products totaled million  a decrease of million or from the year ended december  service revenue was million  an increase of million or from million in this increase in service revenue was attributable mainly to revenue from acquisitions and increased traditional services due to a higher maintenance product base 
revenue growth attributable to the acquisi tions completed in and was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from mil lion for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this represented a decrease in gross margin to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in mar gin percentage is the result of a shift in product mix from high margin direct sales to lower margin oem product sales  primarily in the open storage segment of our business  as well as lower revenue from high margin legacy businesses  and exiting the telecommunication business  which had higher margins 
the in crease in service cost of million was a result of increased service headcount to support the introduction of the fc  professional service start up costs and staffing from the acquisitions 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineer ing expenses for the year ended december  were million  an in crease of million  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research  development and engineering ex penses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase was a result of additional headcount primarily to support fibre channel initiatives and other storage networking products 
including capitalized software  research  development and engineering spending was million for the year ended december   or  of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased personnel and related expenses from acquisitions and additional personnel to support the anticipated increased sales levels for the fibre channel directors  expenses and personnel added in connection with our initial public offering to support being a public company and spending related to additional product marketing initiatives 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was a result of the full period effects of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the busi nesses acquired during and the acquisitions completed in restructuring and special charges 
restructuring and special charges for the year ended december  were million as compared to a gain of million in the special charges were attributable to restruc turing costs associated with our actions to streamline operations and improve efficiencies and our exit from the telecommunications business 
the charges primarily include severance  lease abandonment costs  costs associated with existing obligations related to discontinued product lines  and amounts re lated to the settlement of contractual obligations 
restructuring and special charges include million for a reduction in headcount of approximately employees in selected non strategic product areas 
charges totaling million were recorded in connection with the set tlement of a contractual obligation on a discontinued product 
other costs of million are associated with existing obligations related to discontinued product lines 
the gain recorded in was related primarily to a reversal of a charge recorded in december of for abandonment of certain facilities  offset by million in charges for options issued to employees of spx 
asset impairment charges 
asset impairment charges for the year ended de cember  were million 
the charges related primarily to asset write downs associated with discontinued product lines million  the write down of goodwill from an acquisition completed in million and the write down of strategic investments made in business partners million 
there were no asset impairment charges in write off of acquired in process technology 
in conjunction with the acqui sition of varcom corporation  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired in process technology in interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended decem ber  as compared to million for the year ended december  in  we received approximately million of interest income from our demand note with spx as compared to million in the remaining inter est was earned from cash invested in a money market account 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended de cember  as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest expense incurred in included million related to our foreign operations and million interest accrued on our notes to sell ers related to business acquisitions in the interest expense for the year ended december  was principally for money loaned to us by spx for the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of we repaid the loan for these acquisitions from the ipo proceeds 
other income expense 
we had minimal other income expense for the years ended december  and income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate of the tax benefit recorded on the pretax loss in was due to the amount of income derived from foreign subsidiaries which are taxed at rates higher than the domestic statutory rates and the inability to use certain domestic losses for state tax purposes 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  excluding the negative impact of foreign currency transla tions in europe  revenue increased to million  an increase of million or sales of our open storage networking products were million  an in crease of million  or from million in the year ended decem ber  our open storage networking products consist of fibre channel directors and optical networking equipment as well as related services for these products 
the increase was primarily driven by sales of the fc di rector  which was released for general availability during the third quarter of service revenue was million  an increase of million or from million 
this increase was attributable to revenue from ac quisitions  our entry into professional services and higher revenue associated with increased product sales 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of rev enue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this represented a slight decrease in gross margin to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue was related to in creased sales  higher service costs and a change in mix of products sold 
the increase in service cost of million was a result of increased service headcount to support the introduction of the fc  professional service start up costs and staffing from the acquisitions 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineer ing expenses for the year ended december  were million  an in crease of million  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research  development and engineering ex penses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase was a result of additional headcount primarily to support fibre channel initiatives  and other storage networking products  as well as new datacom and telecom programs 
the addi tional headcount for the data networking and telecom networking programs were principally from acquisitions 
including capitalized software  research devel opment and engineering spending was million for the year ended december   or  of revenue  compared to million  or of reve nue  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  selling and administrative personnel and related costs of approximately million from the acquired businesses are included in the december  amounts 
the remainder of the increase was due pri marily to increased personnel to support the expected sales levels for the fc  from spending related to additional marketing and e commerce initiatives and from hiring additional key management personnel in support of our ipo 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was a result of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the three acquisitions completed in special charges 
special charges for the year ended december  were a gain of million as compared to million of expense in the gain recorded in was related primarily to a reversal of a charge recorded in december for abandonment of certain facilities  offset by million in charges for options issued to employees of spx 
we incurred special charges of million in comprised primarily of million for cash sever ance payments to approximately hourly and salaried employees  million for field sales and service office closings  million for product line discontinuance and million for the abandonment of a leased facility 
write off of acquired in process technology 
in conjunction with the acqui sition of varcom corporation  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired in process technology 
gain on sale of real estate 
during the year ended december   we sold one of our facilities for million and recognized a gain on sale of real estate of million 
in  we sold a manufacturing facility and are leasing back a portion of the site 
we fully recovered our cost basis in the property and have deferred the gain  which we are recognizing over the term of the lease 
interest income 
interest income in consisted of approximately million from our demand note with spx and from cash invested in a money market account 
interest income in was and related primarily to interest on bank deposits 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended de cember  as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest expense for the year ended december  was princi pally for money loaned to us by spx for the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of the loan for these acquisitions was repaid from the ipo proceeds 
the interest expense for the year ended december  was in curred related to borrowings on foreign lines of credit 
other income expense 
we had minimal other income expense for the year ended december  as compared to million of income for the year ended december  the income in was attributable to a gain we rec ognized on the sale of an investment 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  quarterly financial information the following table presents our unaudited quarterly statement of opera tions data for and this information was derived from our unaudited financial statements

other factors that may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter include 
the timing and market acceptance of product introductions or enhance ments by us or our competitors  
the size  timing  terms and fluctuations of customer orders  
customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  
technological changes in the networking industry

liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities was million for the year ended december  during this period  cash flow from operations was generated principally from decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and in creases in accounts payable  offset by a decrease in accrued expenses 
cash flow used for investing activities was million for the year ended december  of that amount  million was related to the cash payments for acquired businesses  including transaction costs  and the remain der was used for additions of property and equipment  capitalized software  demonstration equipment and other assets 
amounts utilized for investing ac tivities were offset by the reduction in the demand note from spx 
as part of our cash management system  we lend  on a daily basis  our cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to spx 
we lend these amounts to spx under a loan agreement that allows us to demand repayment of outstanding amounts at any time 
however  even after spx repays us the amount due under the loan agreement  as part of our cash management system  we will continue to lend  on a daily basis  all of our cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to spx until the termination of the loan agreement 
the loan agreement will terminate when spx owns less than of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock  or if there is an event of default under spx s credit agreement 
amounts loaned under the loan agreement are unsecured 
interest accrues quarterly at the weighted average rate of interest paid by spx for revolving loans under its credit agreement for the prior quar ter 
for the years ended december  and  the weighted average in terest rate was and  respectively 
spx s ability to repay these borrowings is subject to spx s financial condition and liquidity  including its ability to borrow under its credit agreement or otherwise 
for the year ended december   net cash used for financing activi ties was million consisting of net cash outflows related to our payment on seller notes associated with the acquisitions completed in in  we expect that our purchases of property  plant and equipment will be approximately million  capitalized software costs will be approxi mately million and payments for product rights will be at least mil lion 
we believe that the demand note from spx  together with current cash bal ances  foreign credit facilities and cash provided by future operations  will be sufficient to meet the working capital  capital expenditure and research and development requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  if addi tional funds are required to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes  we may seek to raise such additional funds through borrowings from spx  through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
our ability to issue equity may be limited by spx s desire to preserve its ability in the future to effect a tax free spin off and by limitations under spx s credit agreement 
in addition  our ability to borrow money may be lim ited by restrictions under spx s credit agreement 
additional financing may not be available  or  if it is available  it may be dilutive or may not be ob tainable on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued state ments of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these pronouncements change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirement of sfas is effective for any business combination that is completed after june  sfas states that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply immediately to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   companies are required to adopt the pronouncement in the fiscal year beginning after december  we currently are evaluating the provisions of sfas and sfas and the impact that adoption will have on our financial position and results of opera tions 
all of our other purchased intangible assets have been separately iden tified and recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
these intangibles are being amortized over the estimated useful lives or contractual lives  as ap propriate 
based on historical purchase price allocations or preliminary allo cations for business combinations completed prior to july   we estimate that the cessation of goodwill amortization will increase our operating income by approximately million on an annualized basis when these accounting pronouncements are adopted 
in order to complete the transitional assessment of goodwill and non amor tizing intangible assets impairment  we will need to identify the report ing units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we will have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a re porting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the re porting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be completed no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we have net unamortized goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
we have not yet determined what the effect of the impairment tests will be on our consoli dated financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retire ment obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for obligations as sociated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and retirement of assets 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a signif icant impact on the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impair ment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas no 
sfas no 
superceded sfas no 
and accounting principles board opinion no 
 re porting the results of operations reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for the year ending december   however  early application is permitted 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this report 
these are not the only risks and uncer tainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not cur rently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks relating to our business our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
our success depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing mar kets in which we operate  including changes in relevant industry standards and the changing needs of our customers 
to address this risk  we must develop and introduce high quality  technologically advanced  cost effective products and product enhancements on a timely basis 
if we are not able to develop and in troduce new products successfully within the timeframe we expect or prior to the time our competitors do  our future revenue and earnings will be impaired and our reputation for producing technologically advanced products could be damaged 
we may experience delays in the development of new products 
given the relatively short product life cycles in the market for our prod ucts  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product intro ductions or product enhancements could significantly harm our future revenue and earnings 
we built our existing fc based on certain microchips known as application specific integrated circuits or asics licensed from qlogic 
to provide customers with scalability and investment protection with their cur rent generation director  we decided to develop our next generation fc internally 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  in cluding 
failure to develop or license the necessary technology on a timely basis  
difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  
difficulties with independent contractors and suppliers  
failure to obtain regulatory approvals  
changing product specifications  and 
unanticipated engineering complexities 
since developing new products on a timely basis is critical to our success  any delay we experience in developing new products could reduce our revenue and profitability 
we may overestimate the demand for  and market acceptance of  the new or enhanced products that we develop 
we attempt to continuously bring new products to market 
there is a risk that some of these products will not be accepted by the market 
we undertake significant research and development expense prior to marketing any new prod uct 
as a result  if the new products that we introduce do not gain accept ance  not only will we lose sales as a result of not having developed a prod uct that the market accepts  but we will have used our resources ineffective ly 
our financial success depends on our ability to manage the phasing out of old products and the introduction of new products 
we must successfully predict when one of our products has reached the end of its life cycle and when it has to be updated  replaced or phased out 
if a product is not technologically advanced  customers will frequently delay pur chasing that product in the expectation that a more advanced product will be developed by us or one of our competitors  particularly near the end of a product s life cycle 
in addition  selling a number of products that are at the end of their life cycle may harm our reputation as being technologically advanced 
we must manage the introduction of new or enhanced products in order to minimize disruption in our customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet our customers demands 
widespread adoption of storage area networks  and the fibre channel protocol on which these networks are based  is critical to our future success 
if other technologies become predominant or readily accepted  our business will be significantly harmed 
the market for storage area networks is rapidly evolving 
our fc  which operates using the fibre channel protocol  is used exclusively in stor age area networks 
in addition  our fc switching products are designed to operate in corporate data centers 
currently  there are only limited fibre channel storage area network products operating in these data centers and po tential end users may seek to adopt networks with different protocols 
poten tial end users  particularly those who have invested substantial resources in their existing data storage and management systems  may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach  like storage area networks  or may want to adopt a different solution than fibre channel  such as gigabit ethernet 
if other technologies become predominant or readily accepted  our business will be sig nificantly harmed 
therefore  it is difficult to predict the potential size or future growth rate of products using the fibre channel protocol 
our success in penetrating this emerging market will depend on  among other things  our ability to 
educate potential original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users about the benefits of fibre channel storage area network technology and overcoming its limitations  and 
predict and base our products on standards that ultimately become industry standards 
in addition  storage area networks are often implemented in connection with deployment of new storage systems and servers 
accordingly  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
if sales of our fc do not grow as we anticipate  our revenue and earnings could be less than we anticipate 
we began shipping the fc as a gigabit second speed product in april by late  we expect the market to begin transitioning to a gigabit second speed product 
our future sales growth and financial results are highly dependent on our successful introduction of a gigabit second product  the market transition from gigabit speeds to gigabit speeds  and the growth of sales of the both and gigabit second fc s 
sales of the fc may not grow as quickly as we expect for various reasons  including 
storage networks that are used in applications that are critical to a business operations may not convert to switches using fibre channel protocol  
we or our customers may discover problems in the gigabit fc that we may not be able to fix quickly and cost effectively  if at all  and 
other companies may produce products with similar or greater capabilities that may have more attractive pricing 
continuing to resell our fc through our existing distribution channels could limit our ability to increase product profitability 
we have historically sold the majority of our products through our direct sales force 
in  we had significant increases in our reseller channels 
to expand our sales  particularly in the storage area network market  we sell certain of our products through indirect sales channels 
we only recently be gan marketing our products through these sales channels  and our success with our products through this channel will depend on the success of our resellers 
if we are not successful in our efforts to sell to and through these indirect sales channels  our revenues and earnings may not grow as rapidly as those of our competitors who have established indirect sales channel relationships 
in addition  if we have success in this channel  the decision of a large reseller to discontinue carrying our products could affect our revenues and earnings significantly 
a large portion of our fc sales come from indirect channels 
the loss of an indirect channel partner could significantly affect our revenue in this product 
we sell most of our fc s through large global resellers  most of whom sell our fc together with their storage devices as part of a storage area network implementation 
if we were to lose any of these indirect channel part ners  our sales of the fc could be significantly reduced 
we rely on sole sources of supply for some key components of our products 
any disruption in our relationships with these sources could increase our product costs and reduce our ability to supply our products on a timely basis 
we purchase microchips that are specifically designed for the fc and next generation products from sole sources 
since we anticipate that a signif icant amount of our revenue growth will come from sales of our current and fu ture generation fc s  any circumstance that results in our inability to acquire microchips could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
due to the nature of our products  our largest customers in any given period may not continue their levels of purchases in future periods  and  accordingly  our results of operations will be adversely affected if we do not develop significant additional customers 
our twenty largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
because our products represent significant capital purchases by our customers  we generally do not expect that customers who make substantial pur chases in any given fiscal period will continue to make comparable purchases in subsequent periods 
accordingly  if we do not replace these customers  our revenue may decrease significantly and quickly 
the prices we charge for our products may continue to decline  which may result in a reduction in our profitability 
we anticipate that as products in the storage area network market become more prevalent  the average unit price of our products may decrease in re sponse to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the maturing life cycle of our products  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
also  sales through indirect reseller channels  which we ex pect to grow as a percentage of our revenues  have lower gross margins than sales through direct sales channels 
if we are not successful in our efforts to reduce the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions  as well as through increased sales of higher margin products  our profitability will decline significantly 
because our intellectual property is critical to our success  our revenue and earnings would suffer if we were unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
because our products rely on proprietary technology and will likely con tinue to rely on technological advancements for market acceptance  we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business 
to protect these rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
we also enter into confi dentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documenta tion and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
it is difficult for us to monitor unauthorized uses of our products 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we are un able to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may be able to use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
we may not be able to effectively compete against these compa nies 
competition in network markets may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share 
the markets in which we sell products and services are highly competitive 
some of the companies with which we compete have substantially greater re sources  greater name recognition and access to larger customer bases than we do 
our competitors may succeed in adapting more rapidly and effectively to changes in technology or the market 
if we fail to compete effectively  it could materially adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
in particular  the business of providing products and related services to the storage area network market is highly competitive 
our future growth is highly dependent on this business 
our primary competitors in the fibre chan nel switch market are brocade communications and mcdata  both of which cur rently sell more fibre channel switches than we do 
the perception by some that these companies are early leaders in the storage area network market may materially adversely affect our ability to develop new customer relationships 
other companies are also providing fibre channel switches and other products in our markets  and their products could become more widely accepted than ours 
in addition  a number of companies are developing  or have developed  fibre channel products other than switches  such as adapters or hubs  that compete with our products in some applications 
these competitors may develop products that are more advanced than our products 
to the extent that these companies have current supplier relationships with our potential customers  it will be more difficult for us to win business from these potential customers 
if fibre channel technology gains wider market acceptance  it is likely that an increasing number of competitors will begin developing and marketing fibre channel products 
the segment of the data networking market in which we compete is highly competitive and subject to continual technological changes 
in the data networking market we face competition from major systems integrators and other established and emerging companies 
undetected software or hardware defects in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could increase our costs or reduce our revenue 
our products may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are complex  and we have from time to time detected errors in existing products  and we may from time to time find errors in our existing  new or enhanced products 
in addi tion  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these errors could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and would increase our costs  reduce our revenue  harm our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems 
industry standards affecting our business evolve rapidly  and if we do not develop products that are compatible with these evolving standards  our revenue and earnings will suffer 
all components of a storage area network must comply with the same stan dards in order to operate efficiently together 
however  there are often vari ous competing industry standards 
we are not able to predict which industry standard will become predominant 
whether a standard becomes predominant is often due  in part  to the amount of support these standards receive from in dustry leaders  which are generally larger and more influential than we are 
often  our products are not compatible with all industry standards 
if an in dustry standard with which our products are not compatible becomes predomi nant  sales of our products will suffer or we may have to incur significant costs to adapt our products to new industry standards and to make our products adaptable to a wide range of standards 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contribu tions of our key personnel in engineering  research  sales  marketing  finance and operations 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on our key per sonnel and do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
if we lose the services of any of our key personnel  it could have a negative im pact on our business 
if we do not hire  retain and integrate highly skilled managerial  engineering  research  sales  marketing  finance and operations personnel  our business may suffer 
we believe our future success also will depend in large part upon our abil ity to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  research  sales  marketing  finance and operations personnel 
competition for profes sionals in our industry is intense and increasing 
we may not be able to at tract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or if we experience delays in hiring re quired personnel  particularly qualified engineers and sales personnel  our ability to develop  introduce and sell our products could be materially harm ed 
if our stock price declines or does not increase significantly or options in our company are not perceived as highly valuable  we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  because a portion of our employ ees compensation is stock based 
our non competition agreements with our employees may not be enforceable 
if any of these employees leaves our company and joins a competitor  our competitor could benefit from the expertise our former employee gained while working for us 
we currently have non competition agreements with some of our employees 
these agreements prohibit our employees  in the event they cease to work for us  from directly competing with us or working for our competitors 
under cur rent us law  we may not be able to enforce some of these non competition agreements 
if we are unable to enforce any of these agreements  our competi tors that employ our former employees could benefit from the expertise our former employees gained while working for us 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue and operating re sults from quarter to quarter  and even during a quarter  as a result of a combination of factors 
we expect these fluctuations to continue in future periods 
because we sell high end products with relatively high costs for each product  our financial results for each quarter may be materially affected by the timing of particular orders  and the timing of significant events  like the terrorist events of september  we anticipate that our largest customers in one period may not be our largest customers in future periods 
numerous other factors that may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly financial information 
many of our sales are made in conjunction with sales by other vendors or related products 
if our customer s relationship with the vendor terminates  or our relationship with the vendor terminates  the customer may terminate its relationship with us 
we sell components of complicated network systems 
many vendors sell compo nents  related to our products  that customers purchase when they purchase our products 
if the relationship between the customer and the other vendor dete riorates or terminates  or if the vendor s products are perceived as not being state of the art or cost effective  our relationship with that customer might be in jeopardy and may be terminated 
in addition  a third party vendor often is the prime contractor for sales of products and related services to our customers 
the third party vendor may choose to terminate its relationship with us  or otherwise choose not to bring us sales opportunities 
if our relationships with these vendors terminate  we would lose those referral sales opportunities 
acquisitions that we complete may be dilutive to earnings and may never generate income 
acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future may be dilutive to our earnings since the prices being paid for technology companies are high relative to their earnings 
in addition  since we are in a high technology business  we are likely to acquire companies whose products are not yet proven and may never become profitable 
as a result  we may pay a high price for a company that may never produce earnings 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from international sources  and difficulties associated with our international operations could harm our revenue and earnings 
we derived approximately of our revenue from customers located outside of the united states 
we believe that our continued growth and profit ability will require us to continue to penetrate international markets 
if we are unable to successfully manage the difficulties associated with interna tional operations and maintain and expand our international operations  our revenue and earnings could be substantially lower than we anticipate 
these difficulties are heightened because we are in a highly technical industry and include 
difficulties related to staffing for our highly technical industry  
licenses  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers imposed on products such as ours  
reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  
difficulties related to obtaining approvals for products from foreign governmental agencies that regulate networks  and 
compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties relating to telecommunications and networking equipment 
in addition  all of our manufacturing is currently performed in the united states 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets 
a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which would subject us to risks associ ated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
risks relating to our relationship with spx we will be controlled by spx so long as it owns a majority of the voting power of our common stock  and our other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote during that time 
spx beneficially owns of our outstanding class a common stock and ap proximately of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock 
this represents about of the combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
because of spx s control of our company  investors will be unable to affect or change the management or the direction of our company 
as a result  some investors may be unwilling to purchase our class b common stock 
if the demand for our class b common stock is reduced because of spx s control of our company  the price of our class b common stock could be materi ally depressed 
until spx beneficially owns less than of the combined voting power of our stock  spx will be able to elect our entire board of directors and gener ally to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
as a result  spx will be in a position to control all matters af fecting our company  including decisions as to 
our corporate direction and policies  
the composition of our board of directors  
future issuances of our common stock or other securities  
our incurrence of debt  
amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  
payment of dividends on our common stock  and 
acquisitions  sales of our assets  mergers or similar transactions  including transactions involving a change of control 
the limited voting rights of our class b common stock could impact its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identi cal rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to five votes per share and holders of our class b common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
we sold class b common stock in our initial public offering 
the difference in the voting rights of the class a and class b common stock could diminish the value of the class b common stock to the extent that investors or any potential fu ture purchasers of our class b common stock ascribe value to the superior vot ing rights of the class a common stock 
in addition  if spx distributes our class a common stock to its stockholders  the existence of two separate clas ses of publicly traded common stock could result in less liquidity for either class of our common stock than if there were only one class of common stock and could result in the market price of our class b common stock being lower than the market price of our class a common stock 
we may have conflicts with spx with respect to our past and ongoing relationships 
we may have conflicts with spx in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships  including 
spx s ability to control our management and affairs  
the nature  quality and pricing of ongoing services that spx has agreed to provide us  
business opportunities that may be attractive to both spx and us  
litigation  labor  tax  employee benefit and other matters arising from our no longer being a wholly owned subsidiary of spx  
the incurrence of debt and major business combinations by us  and 
sales or distributions by spx of all or any portion of its ownership interest in us 
we may not be able to resolve these conflicts and  even if we are able to do so  the resolution of these conflicts may not be as favorable as if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws do not contain any special provisions setting forth rules governing these potential conflicts 
the agreements between spx and us were not made on an arm s length basis  and may not be fair to us 
the contractual agreements we have with spx for spx to provide us with var ious ongoing services were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and were negotiated in the overall context of our ipo 
in addition  these agreements may be amended from time to time upon agreement between the parties and  as long as spx is our controlling stockholder  it will have significant influence over our decision to agree to any amendments 
as a result of spx s control over us when these agreements were negotiated or when they may be amended  the prices and other terms under these agreements may be less favora ble to us than what we could obtain in arm s length negotiations with unaffil iated third parties for similar services 
we are subject to restrictions contained in spx s credit agreement 
under the terms of spx s credit agreement  even after our initial public offering  we continue to be considered a subsidiary of spx for as long as spx holds more than of the combined voting power of our common stock 
as a re sult  we continue to be subject to the covenants contained in spx s credit agreement that restrict spx and its subsidiaries  including covenants limiting acquisitions  issuances of stock and options  indebtedness  liens  sale of as sets and capital expenditures 
these covenants could restrict our ability to operate our business  moreover  we may have conflicts with spx as to our abil ity to take advantage of baskets and other provisions contained in the credit agreement which spx may want to utilize for itself or its other subsidiaries 
we lend the excess cash we generate on a daily basis to spx 
spx s ability to repay these amounts is subject to spx s financial condition as part of our cash management system  we lend  on a daily basis  our cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to spx 
we lend these amounts to spx under a loan agreement that allows us to demand repayment of outstanding amounts loaned under the agreement at any time 
however  even after spx repays us the amount due under the loan agreement  as part of our cash management system we will continue to lend  on a daily basis  all of our cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to spx until the termination of the loan agreement 
the loan agreement will terminate when spx owns less than of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock or if there is an event of default under spx s credit agreement 
amounts loaned un der the loan agreement will be unsecured 
loans made prior to october   accrued interest quarterly at a rate of and  loans made on or after octo ber   accrue interest quarterly at the weighted average rate of inter est paid by spx for revolving loans under its credit agreement for the prior quarter 
spx s ability to repay the amounts that we lend will be subject to spx s financial condition and liquidity  including its ability to borrow under its credit agreement or otherwise 
spx is more leveraged than we are and  be cause it is in businesses that are different from ours  is subject to differ ent risks 
many of its businesses  such as its automotive business  are cyclical and subject to pricing pressures and environmental risks 
in the event that spx files for bankruptcy protection  spx s ability to repay the loans will be subject to bankruptcy laws as well as other applicable laws  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to re cover amounts loaned to spx 
in addition  any amounts paid or repaid to us by spx during the one year period prior to any bankruptcy filing by spx may be subject to recovery by spx or a trustee in spx s bankruptcy case as a prefer ential payment 
a number of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors or executive officers of spx or own spx stock 
five members of our board of directors are directors or executive officers of spx and all of our directors were appointed by spx 
our directors who are also directors or executive officers of spx will have obligations to both com panies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us  such as acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both us and spx 
in addition  a number of our directors  exec utive officers and other employees own spx stock and options on spx stock that they acquired as employees of spx 
this ownership could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and spx 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not have special pro visions to deal with these potential conflicts and we intend to deal with con flicts on a case by case basis 
we are part of spx s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  spx s actions may adversely affect us 
as long as spx owns at least of the combined vote and value of our cap ital stock  we will be included in spx s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
under a tax sharing agreement with spx  we will pay spx the amount of federal  state and local income taxes that we would be required to pay to the relevant taxing authorities if we were a separate taxpayer not in cluded in spx s consolidated  unitary or combined returns 
in addition  by virtue of its controlling ownership and the tax sharing agreement  spx will effectively control substantially all of our tax decisions 
under the tax sharing agreement  spx will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings  including tax audits  relating to spx s consolidated  unitary or combined income tax returns in which we are included 
moreover  even though we have a tax sharing agreement with spx  federal law provides that each mem ber of a consolidated group is liable for the group s entire tax obligation 
thus  to the extent spx or other members of spx s consolidated group fail to make any federal income tax payments required of them by law  we could be lia ble for the shortfall 
similar principles may apply for state or local income tax purposes risks relating to our class b common stock the market price of our class b common stock may fluctuate widely and rapidly 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million our class b common stock 
the purchases will be made at manage ment s discretion in the open market at prevailing prices  or in privately ne gotiated transactions at then prevailing prices 
in february and through march   we repurchased a total of  class b shares at a weighted aver age price of for a total of  the market price of our class b common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of 
changes in and failures to meet financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our stock  
changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting companies in the networking industry  
introductions or announcements  by us or our competitors  of technological innovations or new products  and 
our share repurchases through our announced million share buy back 
the securities of many companies  particularly those in the high technology industry  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent months  often unrelated to the companies operating performance 
these price and volume fluctuations are likely to continue for the securities of high technology companies  and may not bear any relationship to these companies operating performances 
the actual or possible sale of our shares by spx  which owns nearly of our outstanding shares  or option holders could depress or reduce the market price of our class b common stock or cause our shares to trade below the prices at which they would otherwise trade 
the market price of our class b common stock could drop as a result of sales by spx of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur 
these factors also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our class b common stock 
spx is not obligated to retain its shares of our class a common stock and could dispose of its shares of our class a common stock through a public of fering  sales under rule of the securities act of or other transac tions 
upon the sale  each share of class a common stock will be converted into one share of class b common stock 
we have entered into a registration rights agreement with spx that grants it registration rights to facilitate its sale of our shares in the market 
in addition  as of march   there were outstanding options to acquire  shares of our class b common stock 
subject to vesting restrictions  these options may be exercised and the underlying shares of our class b common stock sold 
anti takeover provisions under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may adversely affect the price of our class b common stock  or discourage third parties from making a bid for us 
our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and various provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company  even if spx were no longer our controlling stockholder 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and the various provisions of delaware general corporation law may materially adversely affect the price of our class b common stock  discourage third parties from making a bid for our company or reduce any premium paid to our stockholders for their class b common stock 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock 
the authorization of this preferred stock will enable us to create a poison pill and otherwise may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board 
our certificate of incorporation also provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms 
this classi fication of our board of directors could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the saf est and highest credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any in vestment issuer  guarantor or depository 
our portfolio includes only market able securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
in addition  we utilize a cash management program administered by spx and have a demand note receivable from spx 
interest accrued quarterly on this loan to spx at through october  after october   interest on the loan was adjusted quarterly and accrues at the weighted average rate of interest paid by spx for revolving loans under its credit agreement for the prior quarter 
interest at december  is and the weighted average rate in was 
if the weighted average rate was to decrease by point  the interest income earned in would have been lowered by approxi mately 
million 
the loan to spx is unsecured  and spx s ability to repay the amount due will be subject to its financial condition and liquidity  in cluding its ability to borrow under its credit agreement or otherwise 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation relating to our foreign sub sidiaries 
we do not maintain any derivative financial instruments or hedges to mitigate this fluctuation
