the provision for income taxes for the six months ended june  and was  and  respectively 
this decline in income tax expense of  is primarily due to a reduction of pre tax income generated in the us during the first half of compared to the same period in also  pt buana recorded deferred tax assets during the first half of associated with its prior period tax losses and recorded a tax benefit of  during the period 
in addition  we were able to utilize prior year net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately  during the six months ended june  and lastly  pt buana recorded a significant income tax expense of  during the first half of as a result of the indonesian rupiah strengthening against the us dollar  which created a large unrealized foreign currency gain on pt buana s tax reporting rupiah financial statements 
due to this additional income tax expense  the effective tax rate in the first half of is greater than us statutory corporate income tax rates 
at june   we had nol s of approximately million  which will be available to reduce future us federal taxable income

segment information during the year ended june  and  the six month period ended june  and during the years ended december  and  we were engaged solely in the business of manufacturing and distributing disposable gloves 
we have two business segments  manufacturing and distribution 
these segments are managed as separate strategic business units 
the manufacturing segment  which represents the indonesian operations of pt buana  manufactures powdered and powder free latex gloves and sells them primarily to ahpc and wrp asia 
the distribution segment involves the procurement and sale of gloves purchased from the manufacturing segment and other glove manufacturers and then sold to national and regional healthcare  foodservice  retail and other distributors within the us discussion of the operations of each segment are included throughout the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections 
liquidity and capital resources year ended june  cash and cash equivalents  at june   were  an increase of  from  at june  we experienced an increase in cash flows for the year ended june   primarily from an increase in net cash used in financing activities 
our operations used cash of  during the fiscal year as a result of a net loss of  plus noncash depreciation and amortization of  as well as a decline in accounts receivable and a decrease accounts payable trade 
net inventories were  an increase of  from  at june  net trade accounts receivable at june   decreased by to  from  at june  this decline of  is primarily due to a decrease in revenues and improved collections of past due amounts 
the outstanding accounts receivable from wrp asia results primarily from sales of product to wrp asia powder free exam gloves produced by pt buana  cash advances  charges for obtaining fda approval of the gloves imported from wrp asia and other items 
ahpc purchased virtually all of its latex powder free exam gloves from wrp asia in   and management believes transactions between operating segments are made at prevailing rates 
ahpc purchases its powdered latex gloves from its subsidiary  pt buana  as well as from third party suppliers other than wrp asia 
as of june   we have outstanding accounts receivable from wrp asia of approximately  which has increased by approximately  since june  
this amount includes amounts due to pt buana as june  of approximately  and amounts due to wrpc and ahpc of  subsequent to june   the amounts due to pt buana of  were assigned to wrpc in partial satisfaction of intercompany amounts due from pt buana to wrpc 
as of june   we have accounts payable to wrp asia of approximately  which has increased by  since june   primarily resulting from the purchase of inventories from wrp asia 
the net amount due from wrp asia  before allowance for doubtful accounts at june  was approximately  against which we have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  representing all amounts due for the sale of product from pt buana to wrp asia at june  due to the uncertainty of the finalization of their refinancing plan  which has been ongoing for over months  without completion 
subsequent to june   we entered into a formal agreement with wrp asia to provide for full and complete right of offset of any trade payables due against amounts they owe to wrpc and ahpc 
we continue to purchase gloves from wrp asia  and believe that the unreserved amounts due from wrp asia to wrpc and ahpc of approximately  at june  are realizable based upon the agreement granting right of offset and ongoing purchases from wrp asia 
in management s opinion  while wrp asia does not currently intend to seek protection from creditors  should such action take place  we would have to reevaluate the ability to offset payables to wrp asia against our receivables from them 
wrp asia is continuing its restructuring initiative  the objective of which is to improve cash flows and profitability and to assure longer term financial viability 
this initiative includes a restructuring of wrp asia s debt facility and additional investments from strategic investors and other outside sources 
management of wrp asia has advised us that it believes  but cannot guarantee  that this initiative will be successfully concluded and will generate adequate cash flow to meet wrp asia s needs for its ongoing and future business 
in march  wrp asia had advised us that it anticipated this initiative would be completed by july as of october   this restructuring initiative has not been completed 
wrp asia believes this initiative will now be completed in november and attributes the delays to extensive due diligence being performed by potential strategic investors 
while we are hopeful that a portion of the amount due from wrp asia will be repaid from the refinancing  we have established a reserve for the trade receivables due of  in the event that wrp asia is ultimately unable to complete its restructuring and financing 
on september   our board of directors passed a resolution that limits the net intercompany amount due from wrp asia exceeding the balance of  on a consolidated basis 
in the event that wrp asia desires to purchase product from pt buana  and the effect of this sale would be to increase the net amount due beyond  wpr asia will be required to support these purchases by payment of cash in advance or tender of an irrevocable letter of credit to pt buana to cover the purchase price of the order to the extent such amount exceed  on july   our board of directors approved a proposal submitted by the independent directors to form a special evaluation committee the committee 
the committee is comprised of our b directors  robert simmons and don l 
arnwine as well the independent a directors  g 
jeffery mennen and richard swanson 
the purpose of the committee is to examine the wrp asia restructuring process as well as the options and alternatives available to us 
interest rates in many asian pacific countries have been heavily dependent upon international trade and are  accordingly  affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partner 
the enactment by the government of principal trading partners of protectionist trade legislation  reduction of foreign investment or general declines in the international securities markets could have a significant adverse effect upon the economies of the asian pacific countries 
net inventories at june  increased by to  from  at june  this increase of  is due to new inventory purchases from nonaffiliated parties and increases in safety stock levels 
during the year ended june   we used cash to fund operations  increases in inventories and reduction in accounts payable 
we used cash in investing activities of  during the period 
during the year ended june   we used cash in net investing activities of  we spent  for capital expenditures during that period primarily at pt buana  our indonesian manufacturing plant  for capital improvements 
these expenditures included equipment purchases and upgrades to expand our capacity to manufacture higher margin products  including powder free latex gloves 
during the year ended june   we obtained funds from borrows under our line of credit and other notes 
on december   we obtained a domestic three year credit facility from ge capital  a large commercial credit company 
this asset based lending loan and security agreement included a  revolving line of credit with a  letter of credit sub facility 
on march   we amended our loan and security agreement by increasing the maximum credit loan limit from  to  subject to availability  based on a formula using accounts receivable and inventory 
as part of the amendment  the letter of credit subfacility was increased from  to  the line of credit borrowings carry an interest rate of commercial paper plus at june  
at june   we had outstanding  on the revolving line of credit and  of letter of credit liabilities under the credit facility 
as of june   we were not in compliance with certain of our covenants and have obtained waivers of these covenant violations from the financial institution 
in conjunction with the waiver of the covenant violations as of june   the existing credit facility agreement was amended to expire on december  we utilize the facility of wrp asia to discount pt buana s receivables from ahpc 
amounts available under this arrangement are  mlr  of which  is outstanding as of june  pt buana has guaranteed to wrp asia s lender the payment of the discounted receivables in the event that ahpc does not remit payment 
in october  pursuant to two debenture and warrant purchase agreements between us and two trusts affiliated with one of our directors  we issued  and each trust purchased  a convertible subordinated debenture in the amount of  payable in seven years with interest at over the prime rate 
each debenture is convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in addition  each trust received a warrant exercisable over five years to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at june  the total outstanding debt associated with these debentures was  during the year ended june   we repaid the remaining amount of  against this debt 
we currently expect to have cash needs in order to continue funding the growth of the existing glove business 
these cash needs may arise in connection with various events such as for i the expansion into new products  ii paying off debt obligations  particularly the remaining long term debt  iii the expansion of the manufacturing facility in indonesia  iv purchasing our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program  and v possible acquisitions 
we believe that our cash and cash generated form future operations plus our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations 
year ended june  cash and cash equivalents  at june   was  a decrease of  from  at june  we experienced a decrease in cash flows for the year ended june  primarily from a reduction in cash provided by operations and an increase in net cash used in investing activities 
our operations generated cash of  during the fiscal year as a result of net income of  plus noncash depreciation and amortization of  as well as a decline in inventories and accounts receivable 
net trade accounts receivable at june  decreased by to  from  at december  this decline of  is primarily due to a decrease in revenues and improved collections of past due amounts 
as of june   we have outstanding accounts receivable from wrp asia of  resulting primarily from sales of product to wrp asia  in  cash advances to wrp asia  charges for obtaining fda approval of the gloves imported from wrp asia and others items 
of this amount approximately  is due to pt buana and  is due to wrp usa and ahpc 
the amount of this receivable has increased by  since june  wrp usa and ahpc have accounts payable to wrp asia of  at june   primarily resulting from the purchase of inventories from wrp asia 
this amount has increased by  since june  six months ended june  cash and cash equivalents at june  was  an increase of  from  at december  we experienced an increase in cash flows in the first half of primarily from cash provided by operating activities  offset by uses of cash in financing and investing activities 
our operations generated cash of  during the first half of as a result of net income of  plus non cash depreciation of  and a decline in inventories and accounts receivable  offset by net reductions in the amount owed to our majority shareholder  wrp asia 
net trade accounts receivable at june  decreased by to  from  at december  this decline of  is primarily due to a record sales wwmonth in december as customers were preparing for the year rollover and any unknown events associated with it  as well as to a reduction in may and june sales caused by the loss of the novation contract which expired on april  net inventories at june  decreased by to  from  at december  this decline of  is primarily due to the reduction in novaplus brand inventory levels associated with the loss of the novation group purchasing organization supply contract 
during the six months ended june   the cash generated from operations was used primarily for debt repayments 
we used cash of  in financing activities during the first half of comprised of net reductions on notes payable and line of credit debt of  and for repurchasing  shares of our common stock totaling  under our stock repurchase program 
during the six months ended june   we used cash in net investing activities of  we spent  for capital expenditures during the first six months of primarily at pt buana  our indonesian manufacturing plant  for capital improvements 
critical accounting policies while all of our accounting policies are important in assuring that wrp corporation adheres to current accounting standards  certain policies are particularly important to their impact on our financial statements 
these are described in detail below 
reserves for accounts receivable and inventory 
we review on an ongoing basis the realizability of our trade and inter company receivables and the need for establishing reserves 
as of june   we have established reserves of  in relation to trade and inter company receivables 
goodwill 
the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets purchased is recorded as goodwill 
prior to sfas  the company amortized the goodwill using the straight line method over a period of years 
beginning with fiscal  the company will implement sfas and will no longer amortize the balance of goodwill 
on an ongoing basis  we review goodwill for impairment 
during  we evaluated the realizability of the goodwill through the use of an independent appraisal firm  which utilized the present value of expected future cash flows 
the valuation indicated adequate value to support the recorded goodwill as of june  sales incentives 
certain customers are granted discounts  rebates or other allowances which are intended to assist in the promotion of our products 
we record these discounts and rebates as our customers earn them or when they are paid  depending on the nature of the item 
all discounts  rebates and allowances are shown as a deduction from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax asset 
deferred taxes result from the effect of transactions that are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is adjusted if the realization of deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not 
should our income projections result in the conclusion that realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not  further adjustments to the valuation are made 
the recorded valuation allowance on deferred tax assets reflects the questionable realizability of certain net operating loss carryforwards which are limited due to changes in control within the shareholder group 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than years years after year years operating leases    new accounting standards and pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
this pronouncement provides guidance on financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of investments 
we have not entered into interest rate caps or collars or other hedging instruments 
exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under revolving credit and debt agreements  which have variable interest rates  tied to the prime and commercial paper rates 
we estimate that the fair value of each debt instrument approximated its market value at june  and we are subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah vis a vis the us dollar 
the investment in the indonesian subsidiary is remeasured into the us dollar and the book value of the assets and liabilities of this operation at june  and  approximated its fair value

risks affecting forward looking statements and stock prices in addition to those matters already set forth in item  business and this item  the following may result in us not achieving certain results included in any statement that may be considered a forward looking statement 
we caution the reader that the following risks may not be exhaustive 
variations in quarterly results 
our quarterly operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including risks and uncertainties related to local and international political and economic conditions  foreign currency volatility  competitive pressures  the composition  timing and size of orders from and shipments to major customers  variations in product mix and the size mix between sales  variations in product cost  infrastructure costs  obsolescence of inventory  and other factors as discussed below 
accordingly  our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter 
we operate with little backlog and  as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on the orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur as expected  our operating results may be adversely affected and may fall significantly short of expectations 
any other unanticipated decline in the growth rate of our net revenues  without a corresponding and timely reduction in the growth of operating expenses  could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
we aim to prudently control our operating expenses 
however  there is no assurance that  in the event of any revenue  gross margin or other shortfall in a quarter  we will be able to control expenses sufficiently to meet profitability objectives for the quarter 
financing 
our credit facility  which was due to expire in december  has been renewed and extended until december  the terms and conditions are similar to those in the current credit facility 
dependence on gloves 
we are currently almost exclusively engaged in the manufacture and sale of disposable gloves 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the level of supply of and demand for disposable gloves 
there can be no assurance that the supply of or demand for disposable gloves will continue at current levels or that changes in such supply or such demand will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
dependence on rubber harvest and latex concentrate 
our ability to produce and purchase our products profitably is entirely dependent upon the consistent availability  at competitive prices  of raw rubber harvested by independent growers in malaysia  thailand and indonesia and locally processed by others and us into latex concentrate 
any disruption in the consistent supply of rubber for latex concentrate due to weather or other natural phenomena  labor or transportation stoppages  shortages or other factors  could cause significant adverse effects to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  rubber is a commodity traded on world commodities exchanges and is subject to price fluctuations driven by changing market conditions over which we have no control 
increases in the price of latex concentrate have adversely affected our raw material costs in the past and could continue to do so 
asia pacific risk factors 
social  political and economic instability may be significantly greater in many of the asian pacific countries than that typically associated with the united states and other industrialized countries 
varying degrees of social  political and economic instability could significantly disrupt the source of our supply of glove products 
currencies of several asian pacific countries  including indonesia  korea  malaysia  philippines  singapore  taiwan and thailand  have experienced significant fluctuations against the us dollar 
our indonesian factory maintains its books in the indonesian currency  the rupiah  and reports its indonesian income taxes with rupiah financial reports 
the indonesian rupiah experienced volatile currency fluctuations against the us dollar  which caused significant income tax adjustments in foreign currency exchange volatility may continue and could cause us to incur significant income tax adjustments in the future 
in the past  interest rates in many asian pacific countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by protective trade barriers and the economic conditions of their trading partners  principally  the united states  japan  china and the european union 
the enactment by the united states or other principal trading partners of protectionist trade legislation  reduction of foreign investment in the local economies and general declines in the international securities markets could have a significant adverse effect upon the economies of the asian pacific countries 
governments in certain of the asian pacific countries participate to a significant degree  through ownership interests or regulation  in their respective economies 
action by these governments could have a significant adverse effect on the economies of such countries 
changes in gross margins 
certain of our net product sales are derived from products and markets which typically have lower gross margins compared to other products and markets  due to higher costs and or lower prices associated with the lower gross margin products and markets 
we currently expect that our net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves will continue to increase as a percentage of total net product sales 
in addition  we are currently experiencing pricing pressures due to a number of factors  including competitive conditions  consolidation within certain groups of suppliers  excess supply of products  changing technologies in the production of powder free gloves and increasing demand for new glove products 
additionally  we may not be able to pass on price increases to our customers in a timely manner  or at all 
to the extent that these factors continue  our gross margins could decline  which would adversely affect us and our future operating results 
downward pressure on our gross margins may be mitigated by other factors  such as a reduction in product costs and or an increased percentage of new product sales from higher gross margin products  such as powder free and synthetic gloves 
we are aiming to reduce our product costs and to increase our percentage of net product sales from powder free and synthetic gloves 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
new products 
the foodservice  industrial and retail industries look at our current line of product offerings as just one of a bundle of safety products used by their customers 
developing a profitable line of additional products will be important to the future success of our business 
during  we will be diversifying our product offerings with additional synergistic product lines that address the current safety requirements of our markets 
these additional product offerings include polygloves  heavy duty gloves  headwear  aprons and bibs  food storage bags and educational services 
these products will be offered under our safeprep brand and under private label 
growth dependencies 
in general  our future growth is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  establish new distribution channels  develop affiliations with leading market participants and continue to develop our relationships with our existing customer base 
the failure to achieve these and other objectives could limit future growth and have an adverse effect on both us and our future operating results 
in addition  the pressure to develop and enhance products and to establish and expand markets may cause our sg a expenses to increase  which could also have an adverse effect on us and our future operating results 
manufacturing in indonesia international operations 
our international manufacturing operation has grown substantially and  thus  we are increasingly affected by the risks associated with international operations 
such risks include managing an organization in indonesia  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the burden of complying with international laws and other regulatory and product certification requirements  changes in such laws and requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  import and export controls  international staffing and employment issues  and political and economic stability 
the inability to effectively control and manage these and other risks could adversely affect both our future operating results and us 
competition 
the various markets in which we operate are becoming increasingly competitive as a number of other companies develop and sell products that compete with our products in these markets 
certain of these competitors have significantly more financial and technical resources than us 
we face additional competitive factors besides price  such as product quality  timeliness of delivery  service and the size and reliability of the manufacturer 
these competitive factors may result in  among other things  price discounts by us and sales lost by us to competitors that may adversely affect on our future operating results and us 
reliance upon distributors 
we use various channels to market and distribute our products to end users via third party distributors 
third party distributors are a substantial channel for distribution to end users 
accordingly  our ability to market and distribute our products depends significantly on our relationship with third party distributors  as well as the performance and financial condition of these distributors 
in the event that our relationship with these distributors deteriorates or the performance or financial condition of the distributor becomes unsatisfactory  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
reliance upon significant contracts and customers 
during the year ended june   of net sales came from three of our customers sysco corporation  owens minor  inc  and maxxim medical  inc 
the loss of any of these customers could have a materially adverse impact on us  with the exception of maxxim medical 
excess or obsolete inventory 
managing our inventory of various size mix and product mix is a complex task 
a number of factors  including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain sizes or products which are in short supply or which must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing  the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules  may result in us maintaining excess inventory 
other factors  including changes in market demand and technology  may cause inventory to become obsolete 
any excess or obsolete inventory could result in price reductions and inventory write downs  which  in turn  could adversely affect on our operating results 
hiring and retention of employees 
our continued growth and success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled business  technical  marketing and other personnel is intense 
the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have an adverse effect on our operating results and us 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs in order to compete for skilled employees 
product liability insurance 
participants in the medical supplies business are potentially subject to lawsuits alleging product liability  many of which involve significant damage claims and defense costs 
a successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
claims made against us  regardless of their merit  could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation 
there is no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policy will be adequate or that present levels of coverage will be available at affordable rates in the future 
while we have been able to obtain product liability insurance in the past  such insurance varies in cost  is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits filed against us and other manufacturers 
this litigation is still in the early stages and there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to meet any recovery for which we may be found liable  that the outcome of such suits will not materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition  or that our deductible obligation to fund a portion of the initial cost of defense and or liability of each such lawsuit will not prove financially burdensome 
stock market fluctuations 
in recent years  the stock market in general  including our common stock  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in our revenue growth rates  the loss of a significant customer or sales contract  changes in earnings estimates by market analysis  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  the inability of the market to absorb selling pressure from one or more large institutional shareholders  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
governmental regulations 
our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries  particularly to safety and adherence to quality system regulations qsr s for medical devices 
in the united states  examination gloves are classified as a class i medical device product regulated by the fda 
noncompliance with these fda regulations can result in administrative enforcement  such as warning letters  import alerts  administrative detention or in civil penalties  product bans and recalls 
periodically  the fda inspects shipments of medical gloves as they arrive in the united states ports 
the fda inspections and reviews may cause delays in product delivery and this can result in a loss or delay in recognition of sales and income by us 
in addition  the fda may inspect the manufacturing facilities for compliance with qsrs  which incorporate pre production design and development to achieve consistency with quality system requirements worldwide 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
west coast longshoreman work stoppage 
on september   the pacific maritime association pma  which represents international shipping lines  indefinitely locked out the longshoremen  effectively stopping all import and export activity on west coast ports 
this followed a hour lockout that began on september  these shutdowns were in reaction to work slowdowns by the international longshoremen s warehouse union ilwu  which were taking place over the last several weeks 
on october  the us district court in san francisco issue a temporary restraining order under the authority of the taft hartley act that requires the ports to reopen 
on october  the ports reopened 
we depend heavily on us seaports  especially west coast ports where all of our imports are entered 
we have contingency plans in place in the event another work stoppage should occur 
these plans include  among other things  airfreighting product  locating alternative sources and redirecting existing inventory
