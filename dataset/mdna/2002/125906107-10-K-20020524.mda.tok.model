significant accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  in determining the valuation of inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
other areas in which uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  income tax valuation and resolution of litigation 
actual results will inevitably differ to some extent from the estimates on which the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared at any given point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that the company s management s discussion and analysis and audited financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective on the company
