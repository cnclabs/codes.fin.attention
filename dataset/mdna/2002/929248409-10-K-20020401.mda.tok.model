shipments historically have been concentrated within seven majo r market segments steel service centers  converters processors  construction agriculture  container  automotive  and appliances 
the overall participation i n the construction and the converters processors markets substantially exceeds th e industry average and its reliance on automotive shipments  as a percentage o f total shipments are substantially less than the industry average 
percent of total net tons s hipped year ended december steel service centers converters processors construction agriculture containers automotive appliances exports other total the allocation among customer categories was affected by the strike 
products shipped to wheeling nisshin and occ are included primarily in the converters processors and containers markets  respectively 
set forth below is a description of the wpc group s major custome r categories steel service centers 
the shipments to steel service centers ar e heavily concentrated in the areas of hot rolled and hot dipped galvanized coils due to increased in house costs to steel companies during the s fo r processing services such as slitting  shearing and blanking  steel servic e centers have become a major factor in the distribution of hot rolled products t o ultimate end users 
in addition  steel service centers have become a significan t factor in the sale of hot dipped galvanized products to a variety of smal l consumers such as mechanical contractors  who desire not to be burdened wit h large steel inventories 
converters processors 
the growth of shipments to th e converters processors market is principally attributable to the increase i n shipments of cold rolled products to wheeling nisshin  which uses cold rolle d coils as a substrate to manufacture a variety of coated products  includin g hot dipped galvanized and aluminized coils for the automotive  appliance an d construction markets 
the converters processors industry also represents a majo r outlet for their hot rolled products  which are converted into finishe d commodities such as pipe  tubing and cold rolled strip 
construction 
the shipments to the construction industry are heavil y influenced by fabricated product sales 
wpc services the non residential an d agricultural building and highway industries  principally through shipments o f hot dipped galvanized and painted cold rolled products 
wpc has been able t o market its products into broad geographical areas due to its numerous regiona l facilities 
agriculture 
the shipments to the agricultural market ar e principally sales of roll formed  corrugated sheets which are used as roofin g and siding in the construction of barns  farm machinery enclosures and ligh t commercial buildings 
containers 
the vast majority of shipments to the container marke t are concentrated in tin mill products  which are utilized extensively in th e manufacture of food  aerosol  beverage and general line cans 
the containe r industry has represented a stable market 
the balance of shipments to thi s market consists of cold rolled products for pails and drums 
as a result of th e occ joint venture  the wpc group phased out its existing tin mill productio n facilities 
wpc and nittetsu distribute tin products produced by occ 
automotive 
unlike the majority of its competitors  the wpc group i s not heavily dependent on shipments to the automotive industry 
however  the wp c group has established higher value added niches in this market  particularly i n the area of hot dipped galvanized products for deep drawn automotive underbod y parts 
in addition  the wpc group has been a supplier of tin mill products fo r automotive applications  such as oil filters and gaskets 
appliances 
the shipments to the appliance market are concentrate d in hot dipped galvanized and hot rolled coils 
these products are furnishe d directly to appliance manufacturers as well as to blanking  drawing and stampin g companies that supply oems 
the wpc group has concentrated on niche produc t applications primarily used in washer dryer  refrigerator freezer and rang e appliances 
raw materials the wpc group has the right under the bankruptcy code  subject t o bankruptcy court approval and certain other conditions  to assume or reject an y pre petition executory contracts and unexpired leases 
parties affected by suc h rejections may file pre petition claims with the bankruptcy court in accordanc e with bankruptcy procedures 
in the following discussion  certain existin g contracts of the wpc group are described without attempting to predict whethe r such contracts ultimately will be assumed or rejected in the chapter cases 
the wpc group has a long term contract to purchase a minimum of of its iron ore needs through the iron ore price is based upon prevailin g world market prices 
the wpc group generally consumes approximately millio n gross tons of iron ore pellets in its blast furnace annually 
the wpc group wil l obtain the balance of its iron ore from spot and medium term purchase agreement s at prevailing world market prices 
the wpc group has a long term supply agreement with a third party t o provide the wpc group with a substantial portion of the wpc group s metallurgical coal requirements at competitive prices 
the wpc group s cokin g operations require a substantial amount of metallurgical coal 
the wpc group currently produces coke in excess of its requirement s and typically consumes generally all of the resultant by product coke oven gas in  the wpc group consumed approximately million tons of coking coal i n the production of blast furnace coke 
the wpc group sells its excess coke an d coke oven by products to third party trade customers 
the wpc group s operations require material amounts of other ra w materials  including limestone  oxygen  natural gas and electricity 
these ra w materials are readily available and are purchased on the open market 
the wp c group is presently dependent on external steel scrap for approximately o f its steel melt 
the cost of these materials has been susceptible in the past t o price fluctuations  but worldwide competition in the steel industry ha s frequently limited the ability of steel producers to raise finished produc t prices to recover higher material costs 
certain of the wpc group s raw materia l supply contracts provide for price adjustments in the event of increase d commodity or energy prices 
acklog the wpc group s steel division order backlog was  net tons a t december   compared to  net tons at december  all order s related to the backlog at december  are expected to be shipped durin g the first half of  subject to delays at the customers request 
the orde r backlog represents orders received but not yet completed or shipped 
in times o f strong demand  a higher order backlog may allow the company to increas e production runs  thereby enhancing production efficiencies 
capital investments the wpc group anticipates that it will fund its capital expenditure s in from cash on hand  funds generated by operations and funds availabl e under the dip credit agreement 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures wil l be minimized during the chapter proceedings until liquidity is sufficient and stabilized there can be no assurance that such funds will be sufficient to fund require d capital expenditures 
the wpc group s capital expenditures includin g capitalized interest for were approximately million  including million on environmental projects 
from to such expenditure s aggregated approximately million 
the whx group has no obligation to fund any of the wpc group s future capital expenditures  and does not anticipate doing so 
in the event tha t the wpc group is unable to fund its environmental capital expenditures  claim s may be made against whx for payment of such costs 
energy requirements many of the major facilities at the wpc group that use natural ga s have been equipped to use alternative fuels 
during  coal constitute d approximately of the wpc group s total energy consumption  natural gas and electricity 
the company continually monitors its operations regardin g potential equipment conversion and fuel substitution to reduce energy costs 
employment at december   the wpc group had  employees of whic h  were represented by the united steel workers of america uswa  b y other unions  were salaried employees and the remainder of were non unio n operating employees 
on august   wpsc and uswa entered into a five yea r labor agreement 
in light of the chapter cases  the uswa has agreed to temporaril y waive certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement regardin g guaranteed employment and to temporarily postpone certain gainsharing payment s that otherwise would be due 
additionally  on october   the bankruptcy court entered a n order which  among other things  approved the terms of the modified labo r agreement mla by and among wpc  wpsc and the uswa 
the company is not a party to the mla 
the mla modifies the current wpsc collective bargainin g agreement to provide for  among other things  immediate reductions in wages an d the cost of providing medical benefits to active and retired employees i n exchange for improvement in wages and pension benefits for hourly employees upo n a confirmed wpsc chapter plan of reorganization 
the mla is part of a comprehensive support arrangement that also involves concessions from wps c salaried employees  wpsc s vendors and other constituencies in the chapter proceedings 
competition the steel industry is cyclical in nature and has been marke d historically by overcapacity  resulting in intense competition 
wpc face s increasing competitive pressures from other domestic integrated producers mini mills and processors 
processors compete with wpc in the areas of slitting cold rolling and coating 
mini mills are generally smaller volume stee l producers that use ferrous scrap metals as their basic raw material 
compared t o integrated producers  mini mills  which rely on less capital intensive stee l production methods  have certain advantages 
since mini mills typically are no t unionized  they have more flexible work rules that have resulted in lowe r employment costs per net ton shipped 
since  significant flat rolle d mini mill capacity has been constructed and these mini mills now compete wit h integrated producers in product areas that traditionally have not face d significant competition from mini mills 
in addition  there has been significan t additional flat rolled mini mill capacity constructed in recent years 
thes e mini mills and processors compete with wpc primarily in the commodit y flat rolled steel market 
in the long term  such mini mills and processors ma y also compete with wpc in producing value added products 
in addition  th e increased competition in commodity product markets influence certain integrate d producers to increase product offerings to compete with wpc s custom products 
as the single largest steel consuming country in the western world the united states has long been a favorite market of steel producers in europ e and japan 
in addition  steel producers from korea  taiwan  and brazil  an d other large economies such as russia and china  have also recognized the unite d states as a target market 
steel imports of flat rolled products as a percentag e of domestic apparent consumption  excluding semi finished steel  have bee n approximately in  in  in  in and i n imports surged in due to severe economic conditions in southeas t asia  latin america  japan and russia  among others 
average import customs values i n december continued to be depressed with the average import value of som e key finished steel products below values reported in the depths of the crisis 
world steel demand  world export prices  us dollar exchange rates an d the international competitiveness of the domestic steel industry have all bee n factors in these import levels 
in march  the united states government announced its decisio n to enact tariffs on certain imported steel 
these tariffs begin at and rang e down to over three years 
certain of these tariffs will be imposed on stee l imports that compete directly with wpc 
it is not yet known what impact thi s will have on wpc or the united states steel industry 
total annual steel consumption in the united states ha s fluctuated between million and million tons since a number of stee l substitutes  including plastics  aluminum  composites and glass  have reduce d the growth of domestic steel consumption 
item properties handy harman h h has active operating plants in the united states  canada england  denmark and singapore owned with a total area of approximatel y  square feet  including warehouse  office and laboratory space  but no t including the plant used by the singapore operation

the october order also approved a supplemental agreement among th e members of the wpc group and whx under which all of the extensions of credi t referred to in the preceding paragraph are granted super priority claim statu s in wpsc s chapter case and are secured by a lien on substantially all of th e assets of wpsc  junior to the liens  security interests and super priorit y claims of the lenders to wpsc under the dip credit agreement 
the supplementa l agreement also provides  among other things  that whx may sell  transfer o r dispose of the stock of wpc free from the automatic stay imposed under th e bankruptcy code  and under specified circumstances requires wpc to suppor t certain changes to the whx pension plan 
additionally  the october order approved the terms of the modifie d labor agreement mla by and among wpc  wpsc and the uswa 
whx is not a part y to the mla 
the mla modifies the current wpsc collective bargaining agreement t o provide for  among other things  immediate reductions in wages and the cost o f providing medical benefits to active and retired employees in exchange fo r improvement in wages and pension benefits for hourly employees upon a confirme d wpsc chapter plan of reorganization 
the mla is part of a comprehensiv e support arrangement that also involves concessions from wpsc salaried employees wpsc s vendors and other constituencies in the chapter proceedings 
in january  wpsc finalized a financial support plan whic h included a million loan from the state of west virginia  a loan from th e state of ohio  million in advance by the unimast segment for future stee l purchases  a portion of which shall be delivered on or before march  and additional wage and salary deferrals from wpsc union and salaried employees management of the company cannot at this time determine wit h certainty the ultimate outcome of the chapter proceedings  however it i s possible that the following outcomes could result o the wpc group could reorganize  and its creditors could receive a portion of their claims in cash or in stock of wpc or wpsc 
o the wpc group could be sold in its entirety or segments could be sold and the proceeds from such sale s would be utilized to satisf y creditor claims 
o the creditors could assume ownership of the wpc group or wpsc an d continue to operate such businesses 
in each of the above possible outcomes  the whx group would hav e little or no future ownership in or involvement with the wpc group  and the wh x group future cash obligations to or on behalf of the wpc group would be minima l to none other than the million pension contribution referred to above it is also possible that none of the above outcomes would occur and the wp c group may shut down a number of their operations 
according to whx s preliminar y evaluation of potential pension obligations  if a partial shutdown of the wp c group s operations were to occur in the immediate future whx s liability fo r early retirement pension benefits could range from approximately million t o million 
it is also possible that the wpc group could cease operations i n their entirety and this liability would then be significantly greater 
however management does not believe this occurrence is likely 
under current pension la w and regulations based on the whx s analysis of the current funded status of th e pension plan  if a partial shutdown were to occur after january   th e cash funding obligations related to such partial shutdown would likely not begi n until and would extend over several years 
such cash funding obligation s would have a material adverse impact on the liquidity  financial position an d capital resources of whx 
whx s funding obligation and the impact on it s liquidity  financial position and capital resources could be substantiall y reduced or eliminated if a partial shutdown  if it occurs  were to occur a t such a time that the fair market value of the assets of the plan approximates o r exceeds the plan s liabilities including the early retirement benefits  a shutdown were to occur gradually over several years or the number of the wp c group s operations shut down were less than those assumed in estimating th e above mentioned amounts 
in connection with past collective bargaining agreements by an d between the wpc group and the united steelworkers of america  afl cio cl c uswa  the wpc group is obligated to provide certain medical insurance  lif e insurance  disability and surviving spouse retirement benefits to retire d employees and their dependents opeb obligations 
whx is not a signatory t o any of these agreements 
however  whx has separately agreed to be contingentl y liable for a portion of the opeb obligations 
whx s contingent obligation woul d be triggered in the event that the wpc group were to fail to satisfy its ope b obligations 
whx s contingent obligation is limited to of the accumulate d post retirement benefit obligation with respect to the wpc group s employees an d retirees represented by the uswa 
the total opeb obligation disclosed in th e wheeling pittsburgh steel corporation s december  consolidated financia l statements amounted to million 
whx has estimated that approximately of employees and retirees entitled to such opeb obligations are represented b y the uswa 
whx s contingent obligation exists only so long as a majority o f the directors of wpsc or wpc are affiliated with whx  whx controls the boar d of directors of wpsc or wpc through appointment or election of a majority o f such directors  or whx  through other means  exercises a level of contro l normally associated with or above

the following is a brief discussion of the more significan t accounting policies and methods used by the company 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of al l subsidiary companies except for wheeling pittsburgh corporation and it s subsidiaries 
on november   wheeling pittsburgh corporation wpc  a wholly owned subsidiary of whx corporation whx  and six of its subsidiarie s wpc group filed petitions seeking reorganization under chapter of titl e of the united states bankruptcy code 
see note to the consolidate d financial statements 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing the company has  a s of november   deconsolidated the balance sheet of its wholly owne d subsidiary wpc 
accordingly  the consolidated balance sheets at december and do not include any of the assets or liabilities of wpc 
th e consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of cas h flows exclude the operating results of wpc for the periods after november inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost i s determined by the last in first out lifo method for the unimast segment an d precious metal inventories 
the revaluation of h h s precious metals inventor y at the time of acquisition created the potential for a lower of cost or marke t non cash charge  which would occur if market values fall below lifo cost non precious metal inventory is evaluated for estimated excess and obsolescenc e based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and i s adjusted accordingly 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than thos e projected by the company  additional write downs may be required 
intangibles and amortization the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired in busines s combinations goodwill is amortized on the straight line method for period s ranging from to years 
purchased patents are stated at cost  which i s amortized over the respective remaining lives of the patents 
the company uses estimated future undiscounted cash flows whe n evaluating the recoverability of the unamortized balance of goodwill 
th e recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cas h flows are not achieved 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issue d statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill an d other intangible assets 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  as a result of the adoption of sfas  the compan y will record a million non cash goodwill impairment charge related to th e h h wire group in the first quarter of this charge will be shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the company is taking this charg e because this group s cash flow performance over the last several years has no t met expectations 
the company is still committed to this business and expect s improved performance from this group in future periods as a result of managemen t changes  cost reductions  and improving economic conditions 
however  based o n current cash flow projections  it is estimated that such improved performanc e will not be sufficient to recover all of this group s recorded goodwill 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issue d statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas primaril y addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to thei r acquisition ie  post acquisition accounting 
the provisions of sfas wil l be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and must b e adopted at the beginning of a fiscal year 
the most significant changes made b y sfas are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longe r be amortized  goodwill be will tested for impairment at least annually a t the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite lif e will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization perio d of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas effective januar y  as a result of the adoption of sfas  the company will not recor d amortization expense of approximately million for existing goodwill for th e year ending december  the company recorded amortization expense on thi s goodwill through december  however  any intangible assets acquired o r goodwill arising from transactions after june  will be subject to th e amortization and non amortization provisions of sfas and sfas th e company will record a million non cash goodwill impairment charge relate d to the h h wire group in the first quarter of this charge will be shown a s a cumulative effect of an accounting change

the company is still committed to this business and expect s improved performance from this group in future periods as a result of managemen t changes  cost reductions  and improving economic conditions

in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting fo r asset retirement obligation  sfas 
sfas requires that obligatio n associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset to be recorded a s a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of th e liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro  an entity must capitaliz e the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the relate d long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value eac h period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of th e related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles th e obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement sfas will be effective for the financial statement for fiscal year s beginning after june  whx would be required to adopt the provisions o f sfas in fiscal  however  sfas is not expected to have a significan t effect on whx s financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting fo r the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal o f long lived assets

to a lesser extent  the company is exposed to the risk of pric e fluctuation on coal  coke  and natural gas liquids 
the company is also expose d to the effects of price fluctuations on the value of its commodity inventories specifically  h h s precious metals inventories

sfas 
at december   the whx group held million in equit y securities classified as trading in accordance with sfas each quarter th e company adjusts the carrying amount of its trading securities to fair marke t value  with any resulting adjustment being charged or credited to other income at year end a hypothetical decrease in the value of the equity tradin g securities would have resulted in a million unfavorable impact on pre ta x income 
such a decrease in value might also reduce the future cash flow s generated from the ultimate liquidation of the investment in trading securities see note to the consolidated financial statements interest rate risk fair value of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  short ter m borrowings  accounts payable  accrued interest and variable rate long term deb t approximate their carrying values and are relatively insensitive to changes i n interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments or the variabl e nature of underlying interest rates 
at december   the company s investment portfolio include d fixed income securities totaling million 
the fair value of thes e instruments will increase or decrease as a result of changes in market interes t rates 
the company accounts for these investments as trading securities a s defined by sfas accordingly  each quarter the company adjusts the balanc e of its portfolio to fair market value  with any resulting adjustment bein g charged or credited to income as an unrealized loss or gain and included i n other income 
realized gains and losses resulting from the disposition of suc h investments are recorded as income in the period during which such dispositio n took place 
during  the company recognized realized and unrealized losse s totaling million in connection with its fixed income securities investmen t portfolio as well as its common stock investments

the company attempts to maintain a reasonable balance between fixe d and floating rate debt in an attempt to keep financing costs as low as possible at december   the company s portfolio of long term debt include d fixed rate instruments

in addition  the fair value of such instruments is also affected by investors assessments of the risks associated with industries in which the compan y operates as well as the company s overall creditworthiness and ability t o satisfy such obligations upon their maturity 
however  the company s sensitivit y to interest rate declines and other market risks that might result in a corresponding increase in the fair value of its fixed rate debt portfolio woul d only have an unfavorable effect on the company s result of operations and cas h flows to the extent that the company elected to repurchase or retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at an amount in excess of th e corresponding carrying value 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements fo r certain of its variable rate debt
