uniprise provides claim and customer services and technological solutions for six independent  or unaffiliated  non unitedhealthcare health plans  which serve approximately one million individuals 
we believe that internet technology has created a new channel for providing health information and transaction services to consumers  enrollees  physicians and employers 
uniprise has developed industry 
table of contents leading internet applications for physician inquiries and transactions  customer specific data analysis for employers  and consumer access to personal information and service applications 
for example  one of these applications gives employers instant  real time  online access to add  update or verify employee benefits information at any time 
another application allows consumers to make real time inquiries into the status and history of their health claims  to view and search for care providers through an on line provider directory  to view eligibility information and to access health and well being information tailored to their specific needs and interests 
health care services our health care services segment consists of the unitedhealthcare and ovations businesses 
unitedhealthcare unitedhealthcare coordinates health and well being services on behalf of local employers and consumers nationwide 
unitedhealthcare s products are primarily marketed to small and mid size employers with up to  employees 
as of december   this business served approximately million individuals 
as of december   unitedhealthcare also served approximately  medicare individuals in states with medicare choice products and approximately  medicaid eligible individuals in states 
with some of these product offerings  unitedhealthcare assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its members in return for premium revenue 
unitedhealthcare offers its products through subsidiaries that are usually licensed as health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos or insurers  depending upon state regulations 
it also provides administrative and other management services to health plans and self funded customers for which unitedhealthcare receives a fee  as it does not assume the risk of health care costs 
unitedhealthcare arranges for access to care through more than  physicians and  hospitals across the united states 
the consolidated purchasing power represented by the individuals unitedhealthcare serves makes it possible for unitedhealthcare to contract for cost effective access to a large number of conveniently located care providers 
through its family of companies  unitedhealthcare offers a broad range of benefit plans integrating medical  ancillary and alternative products so customers can choose what is right for them  access to broad and diverse numbers of health care providers  including benefit plans that give customers direct access to specialists without obtaining referrals  innovative programs that facilitate integrated care delivery  convenient self service for customer transactions  pharmacy services and health information  clinical information that physicians can use in working with their patients  simplified electronic transactions for customers  and economic benefits of the purchasing power of millions of people 
we believe that unitedhealthcare s history of innovation distinguishes its product offerings from the competition

for example  unitedhealthcare s multi layered pharmacy benefit program provides access to a wide range of generic and brand name drugs 
individuals who choose to use generic drugs pay less  while those who 
table of contents prefer to use brand name drugs pay more 
our agreement with merck medco managed care llc is an important part of this program 
in addition  unitedhealthcare was an early leader in offering open access products  which allow individuals to schedule appointments directly with specialists without a referral from a primary care physician

expansion and divestiture of operations we continually evaluate expansion opportunities and  in the normal course of business  often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services 
expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations 
during  we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets  all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus 
further  we devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services in the health and well being sector as we have broadly defined it 
if we were to make any particular acquisition  it may affect our ability to integrate and manage our overall business effectively 
integration activities relating to acquisitions may increase costs  affect revenue and earnings growth and adversely affect our financial results 
government regulation most of our health and well being services are heavily regulated 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these revisions could affect our operations and financial results 
enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses 
examples of such laws and regulations include health plan liability laws  physician and provider prompt pay laws  data privacy  mandated benefits  limits on contractual terms with physicians and other health care providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  implementation of a mandatory third party review process for coverage denials  and other laws and limits on utilization management and restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk  such as acts of terrorism 
further  as our businesses continue to implement their e commerce initiatives  uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make compliance an important focus 

table of contents federal programs our health care services segment  which includes unitedhealthcare and ovations  has medicare choice contracts that are regulated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
cms has the right to audit such health plans in order to determine each plan s compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members 
the significant level of regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid makes compliance in this product line a continuing challenge 
our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulation regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 
state regulation all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate the activities of those products and operations 
most states require periodic financial reports and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
many of unitedhealthcare s health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with the state department of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain inter company transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or  in some circumstances  prior notice of acquisitions and material inter company transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries or products may by subject to ppo  managed care organization mco or third party administrator tpa related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ greatly from state to state  but generally contain network  contracting  financial and reporting requirements 
many states also have enacted laws and or adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities  and these laws may apply to some of our operations 
additionally  there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  prompt payment of claims  confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 
to date  these various laws and regulations have not materially affected our financial position or results of operations 
hipaa the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
covered entities must be compliant with standards for electronic transactions and code sets by october  and with standards for privacy of protected health information by april new standards for health information security and national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators 
we are in the process of updating our business practices to comply with these standards 
we plan to be in material compliance by the enforcement dates  however  the law is far reaching and complex and the government s delay in providing guidance may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts 
additionally  different approaches to hipaa s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
erisa the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor dol as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
new erisa claim regulations  effective july  require changes 
table of contents to operations and may lead to increased litigation activity 
we plan to be in material compliance with the new regulations by the enforcement dates 
fraud and abuse the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing 
we have re emphasized our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs  but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources 
additionally  states have also begun to focus their anti fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations 
some states now require filing and approval of anti fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination 
audits and investigations we are regularly subject to governmental audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
any such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms  the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans  our insurance plans and products or one of our other operations regarding issues such as utilization management  financial  eligibility or other data reporting  prompt claims payment  or coverage of medically necessary care  including emergency room care 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general and us attorneys 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
international regulation our ingenix and unitedhealthcare segments both have limited international operations 
as of december   ingenix had provided services to customers for trials occurring in over countries  and unitedhealthcare s international division operated health companies or offered consulting services in nine markets around the world 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property and investment rules and laws 
marketing our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business dedicated marketing staff 
within these segments  primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force 
in addition  several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products 
marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television  radio  newspapers  magazines  billboards  direct mail and telemarketing 
competition as a diversified health and well being services company with a scope that extends far beyond the boundaries of traditional managed health care companies  we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  health care providers which have formed networks to directly contract with employers and various information and consulting companies 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete as well as consolidation within these markets also contribute to this competitive environment 
we believe that the principal competitive factors 
table of contents affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  network capabilities  price  market share  product distribution systems  efficient administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation 
we believe that our competitive strengths include the customer focus resulting from our operational realignment 
each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets 
these businesses are anchored in a common pursuit of improved health and well being  exploiting three core competencies network management  knowledge and information and service infrastructure 
other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products  our geographic scope and diversity  our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs  our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff  our significant market position in certain geographic areas  the strength of our distribution network  our financial strength  our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access our point of service products and our strong marketplace reputation 
however  in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons  including competitors with more resources  longer operating histories  larger market shares  broader networks  narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations 
these competitive factors could adversely affect our business and operating results 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals 
the company believes its employee relations are good 
cautionary statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k and the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of our annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this document  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believes  anticipates  intends  will likely result  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
any of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
this discussion is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws  in making these cautionary statements  we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this report  in the annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from those expressed in our communications 

table of contents health care costs we use a large portion of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our customers 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
much of our premium revenue is priced before services are delivered and the related costs are incurred  usually on a prospective annual basis 
although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred that have not yet been reported to us 
because of these estimates  our earnings may be adjusted later to reflect the actual costs 
relatively small changes in medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and our ability to properly estimate future health care costs over fixed premium periods can create significant changes in our financial results because of the relatively narrow margins of our insurance products 
industry factors the managed care industry receives significant negative publicity and has been the subject of large jury awards 
this publicity has been accompanied by litigation  legislative activity  regulation and governmental review of industry practices 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services  may require us to change our products and services  and may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate  further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our profitability 
competition in many of our geographic or product markets  we compete with a number of other entities  some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage 
we believe the barriers to entry in these markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in moving to new providers of health and well being services 
certain of our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services we provide  which would decrease our revenues 
certain of our contracted physicians and other health care providers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical  medical device and health information systems industries 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers or contracted physicians and other health care providers  or maintain or increase our revenue growth  pricing flexibility  control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 
aarp contract under our long term contract with aarp  we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members 
as of december   our portion of aarp s insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
the success of our aarp arrangement depends  in part  on our ability to service these customers  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
additionally  events that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 

table of contents medicare operations in response to medical cost increases that exceeded medicare program reimbursement rate growth  we have withdrawn our medicare choice product offerings from a number of counties and filed significant benefit adjustments in other counties 
these and other actions have reduced medicare choice enrollment and may result in further withdrawals of medicare choice product offerings  when and as permitted by our contracts with the cms 
we are precluded from re entering the counties from which we have withdrawn our medicare choice product offerings until two years after the effective date of withdrawal 
we will continue to offer medicare choice products in economically viable markets and are exploring alternative arrangements to provide health benefits to seniors 
however  the financial results of our medicare choice operations depend on a number of factors  including future medicare program reimbursement increases  government regulations  benefit design  physician and other health care provider contracting and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our medicare choice operations will be profitable in future periods 
government programs and regulation our business is heavily regulated domestically at the federal  state and local levels and internationally 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely affect our revenue or could increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may also do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
congress is considering patients bill of rights legislation that  if adopted  could fundamentally alter erisa s treatment of liability for noncompliance  fiduciary breach of contract and improper benefit coverage denials 
other bills and regulations at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business including physician and other health care provider contracting  claim payments and processing  confidentiality of health information and government sponsored programs 
while we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation  or if enacted  what their terms will be  their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding arrangements 
further  as our businesses continue to implement their e commerce initiatives  uncertainty surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area will make it difficult to ensure compliance 
we are also subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations 
such oversight could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by the cms  state insurance departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general and us attorneys 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include health maintenance organizations and insurance companies 
these companies are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the subsidiary s level of statutory net income  statutory capital and surplus 
physician  hospital and other health care provider relations one of the significant techniques we use to contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
because our health plans are geographically diverse and most of those health plans contract with a large number of these providers  we believe our aggregate exposure to provider relations issues is limited 
a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these providers from federal and state antitrust laws  the adoption of which could affect this assessment 
in any particular market  these providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies 
litigation and insurance we may be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  including securities fraud  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely party to a variety of legal actions related to the design  management and offerings of our services 
these matters include claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities  disputes over compensation and termination of contracts including those with physicians and other health care providers  disputes related to our administrative services  including actions alleging claim administration errors and failure to disclose rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over benefit copayment calculations  claims related to disclosure of certain business practices  and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
the suits are purported class actions on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico 
while we believe these suits against us are without merit and we intend to defend our position vigorously  we will incur expenses in the defense of these matters and we cannot predict their outcome 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
in some cases  substantial non economic  treble or punitive damages may be sought 
we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities 
other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage  or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
information systems our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences 
for example  the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa and the department of labor s erisa claim processing regulations may require 
table of contents changes to current systems 
in addition  we obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties  which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems and have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could cause the loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  issues in determining medical cost estimates  customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses or other adverse consequences 
data and proprietary information many of our products and services depend significantly on the integrity of the data on which they are based 
if the information contained in our databases were found or perceived to be inaccurate  or if such information were generally perceived to be unreliable  commercial acceptance of our database related products would be adversely and materially affected 
furthermore  the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international  federal  state and local levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
these restrictions could adversely affect revenues from certain of our products or services and  more generally  affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are various recently adopted state laws that address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most enact privacy provisions from the federal gramm leach bliley act 
additionally  new federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective with compliance required by april compliance with these proposals and new regulations could result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes and may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
the success of our knowledge and information related businesses also depends significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure that these legal protections and precautions will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our businesses to market and sell products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 
administration and management efficient and cost effective administration of our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning 
while we manage expenses  staff related and other administrative expenses may increase from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth or changes in business or the mix of products purchased by customers  acquisitions  regulatory requirements or other reasons 
unanticipated expense increases may adversely affect our financial results 
further  we believe we currently have an experienced  capable management and technical staff 
the market for management and technical personnel  including information systems professionals  in the health care industry is very competitive 
loss of certain key employees or a number of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to administer and manage our business 
marketing we market our products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents 
although we have many sales employees and agents  the departure of certain key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers 
in addition  certain of our customers or potential customers consider our debt ratings  accreditation or certification by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important 
certain of 
table of contents our health plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained  or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain  such ratings  accreditation or certification  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain business with these customers 
acquisitions and dispositions we have an active ongoing acquisition and disposition program under which we may engage in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of assets  products or businesses  some or all of which may be material 
these transactions may entail certain risks and uncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities  unforeseen administrative needs or increased efforts to integrate the acquired operations 
failure to identify liabilities  anticipate additional administrative needs or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues  increased administrative and other costs and customer dissatisfaction 
terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks launched on september   the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  the us economy in general and our industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect our company through  among other things  increased use of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  ancillary testing and procedures  increased prescriptions for certain drugs  mental health and other services  loss of membership as a result of lay offs or other reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk  such as acts of terrorism  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
financial outlook from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
general economic conditions changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations 
the state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase prices in some of our businesses 
although we are continuously striving to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of consumers  there can be no assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant loss of customers  or decreased margins on our continuing customers

item legal proceedings in september  a group of plaintiffs trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the managed care industry by way of class action litigation 
since that time  we have received several purported class action matters that generally challenge managed care practices including cost containment mechanisms  disclosure obligations and payment methodologies 
we intend to defend vigorously all of these cases 
in re managed care litigation mdl no 
the multi district litigation panel has consolidated several litigation matters involving unitedhealth group and its affiliates in the southern district of florida  miami division 
the unitedhealth group matters have been consolidated with litigation involving other industry members for the coordination of pre trial proceedings 
the litigation has been divided into two tracks  with one track comprising consumer claims and the other health care provider claims 
generally  the claims made in this consolidated litigation allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits 
the litigation also asserts breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims alleging that unitedhealth group affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered 
the consolidated suits seek injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
following the court s initial decisions on industry members motions to dismiss the complaints  amended complaints were filed in both tracks 
on february  the court granted in part and denied in part the industry defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the member track litigation 
in significant part  the court limited the rico and erisa claims that could be brought by the plaintiffs  and dismissed entirely the common law claims for civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment 
on march   the court certified to the th circuit the threshold issue of whether plaintiffs have standing to assert their rico claims 
the th circuit has not ruled as to whether they will review the issue 
all activity was stayed in the health care provider track pending resolution of a threshold appeal to determine which of the health care provider claims must be arbitrated 
on march   the th circuit affirmed the trial court s arbitration ruling and it is anticipated that the stay will be lifted 
in both tracks  decisions are pending on

additionally  a decision is pending on industry members motion to dismiss in the health care provider track 
the american medical association et al 
v 
metropolitan life insurance company  united healthcare services  inc and unitedhealth group was filed on march  in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york 
on april   we removed this case to federal court 
the suit alleges breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  deceptive acts and practices  and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
the suit seeks declaratory  injunctive  exemplary and compensatory relief as well as costs  fees and interest payments 
an amended complaint was filed on august   which alleged two classes of plaintiffs  an erisa class and a non erisa class 
after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association  a third amended complaint was filed 
we have filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to suits alleging various causes of action 
some of these suits may include claims for substantial non economic or punitive damages 
although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain  we do not believe that any such actions  including those described above  or any other types of actions  currently threatened or pending will  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
