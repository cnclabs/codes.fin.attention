item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not historical facts  and are based on current expectations  estimates  and projections about our industry  our beliefs  our assumptions  and our goals and objectives 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  and estimates  and variations of these words and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
examples of the kinds of forward looking statements in this report include statements regarding the following we believe we are a market leader  our new fab will fulfill our wafer manufacturing capacity needs  current backlog will be shipped in fiscal  our patents may have value and may be useful for cross licensing 
these statements are only predictions  are not guarantees  of future performance  and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict  and could cause actual results to differ materially form those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described below in factors which may affect operating results and elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview supertex designs  develops  manufactures  and markets high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for the use in the telecommunications  imaging  and medical electronics markets 
we also provide wafer foundry services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
factors which may affect operating results semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  or there are changes in underlying circuit or process technology or fab technology 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives  and whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs 
in addition  we are subject to the below described risks  which are specific to us and our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and which we believe we have dominance 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or downturns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain profitable margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
henry pao  a director of and the president and ceo of the company  along with mr 
pao s father and brother  collectively own greater than of our outstanding stock 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
were they to act in concert  they would be our largest shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
problems with foreign economies or wars  or changes in the exchange rate  could adversely affect our foreign sales 
we depend upon one customer  microtek  for approximately of our fiscal year sales 
microtek is our primary distributor in japan with at least twenty end user customers 
most of our customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into rapid decreases in sales volume 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we have an ic design center in hong kong where competition is not as intense 
we are dependent upon several key persons for management and engineering expertise 
their loss would be detrimental to us 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended march  net sales costs of sales research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes net income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oem  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to our distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  limited price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of such sales and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our deferred revenue also includes customer advances under licensing agreements 
we recognize deferred license revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
sales returns and other allowance we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analysis of outstanding return material authorization rma and allowance authorization aa data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due to reduce our net receivable for such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a minimum allowance is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
second  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc 
to us 
in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
while the company has programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments and consolidation our long term investments include direct investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  no established market for their securities exists 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
in addition  adverse operating results of underlying long term investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually 
we have determined that no valuation allowance is required because  although realization is not assured  the company has sufficient taxable income in carryback years to absorb items deductible in the future for federal tax purposes and anticipates that its estimated future taxable income will allow the deferred tax asset for state tax purposes to be fully realized in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizablecould be reduced in the near term if actual results differ significantly from estimates of future taxable income 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments during fiscal  we continued to experience a slowing of demand for our products 
our sales continued to be affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in particular the abrupt business deceleration at our telecom equipment customers 
we are hopeful that as the economy recovers in the coming quarters  these problems may be resolved 
during the year  we maintained the same level of r d investments despite our lower sales 
nevertheless  we generated positive cash flow despite significant capital expenditures for our wafer fabrication facility fab upgrades and for our production test operation  which was moved from sunnyvale  california to hong kong during fiscal we have been s uccessful in controlling costs and have remained profitable and cashflow positive even though sales have dropped significantly and our fab has been running at about capacity 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we had net sales of  in fiscal  a decrease of from the previous fiscal year 
overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year  as were all the markets we serve 
in fiscal  our telecommunications products were adversely affected by the decline in the telecommunications industry s infrastructure spending 
as percentage of total sales for the year ended march   sales to the medical market accounted for of total sales in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the telecommunications market represented and of total sales for the fiscal year and  respectively 
sales to the imaging market accounted for of total sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to all other markets represented in fiscal and in fiscal compared to previous fiscal year on a dollar basis  sales of our medical electronics products decreased to  from  sales of our telecommunications products decreased to  from  and sales of our imaging products decreased to  from  in fiscal  we derived approximately of its net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also decreased approximately from  to  gross margin compared with the prior fiscal year  our gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained approximately the same at for fiscal year despite a drop in sales 
we were able to retain the gross margin level by lowering manufacturing expenditures through rigorous cost reduction measures 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in r d expense for this year was attributed to the increase in payroll and benefit expenses due to additional headcount of  and the increase in mask tooling expenses for the new products of  during the year  we continued to increase our staff and equip our hong kong design center and the telecom design group in san jose  california 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for fiscal dollar reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of  staff reduction and cutback in benefits of  and decreased commission on sales of  interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline in interest income in fiscal was mostly due to lower yields on cash deposit accounts as compared to the prior year 
other income and expense other income of  for fiscal consists primarily of a gain on sale of long term investments of  fees charged to customers for returning products of  licensing income realized of  sublease income net of sublease expenses of  in fiscal  other expense of  consist primarily of an impairment charge of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of an investment in a start up company 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at of income before provision for income taxes 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we had net sales of  in fiscal  an increase of  or from the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the current year s net sales is primarily due to increased unit sales volume of both core and foundry products 
our core business consists of proprietary products for the telecommunications  imaging and medical electronics industries 
as percentage of total sales for the year ended march   sales to the medical market accounted for of total sales in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the telecommunications market represented and of total sales for the fiscal year and  respectively 
sales to the imaging market accounted for of total sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to all other markets represented in fiscal and in fiscal on a dollar basis  sales of our medical electronics products increased to  sales of our telecommunications products increased to  and sales of our imaging products increased to  in fiscal  we derived approximately of its net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately  primarily due to increase in unit sales volume to western europe 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal year this compared to for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin is primarily due to higher production volume in our new six inch fab operation  with its increased economies of scale 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in r d expense for this year was attributed to the increase in payroll and benefit expense of  and the transfer costs of  relating to a the development and re tooling of the old mask sets of our proprietary products  and b the development of new processes for the six inch fab 
during the year  we staffed and equipped our new design center in hong kong and the special telecom project design group in san jose  california 
in february  we acquired certain assets related to the six inch fabrication facility of orbit semiconductor for a total cash purchase price of approximately  including direct costs incurred 
the acquisition of assets has been accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired based on their respective fair values 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands property and equipment  purchased technology  assembled workforce in process technology  the amounts allocated to purchased technology and assembled workforce were determined through known valuation techniques in the high technology industry 
the in process technologies were wafer manufacturing processes which were under development 
these technologies were valued on the premise of fair market value in continued use  employing a version of the income approach referred to as the discounted cash flow method 
this methodology is based on discounting to present value  at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate  the net cash flow that is expected to result from owning these technologies 
supertex management is primarily responsible for the valuation of the acquired in process research and development 
the value assigned to in process technology was determined by identifying development projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible 
these cash flows were discounted back to their present value and a percentage of completion discount was applied to the calculation 
the discount rate used was based on the relative risk involved with intangible assets of this nature  and included an analysis of various factors that could influence the risk associated with realizing projected revenues during the economic life 
the cost of equity was calculated at 
this plus a risk premium was determined as the appropriate discount rate to use 
the premium reflects the additional uncertainty and risk inherent in technology under development and the amount of time remaining to complete the technology 
the percentage of completion for the in process projects ranged from to complete  resulting in estimated cost to complete of  the technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the entire  has been charged to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the acquisition of the orbit inch fab  there were seven processes in the research and development phase 
these processes were being developed without any specific product of supertex in mind  merely to be added to our broad range of available processes offered to the general foundry market 
the potential applications for each of these processes and their description are described below process no 
nature of application very high density analog logic circuits very high density digital logic circuits charged coupled device ccd imaging circuits and infrared sensors low voltage hand held equipment fluorescent lamps display drivers high density analog or mixed signal circuits precision temperature control or sensing circuits the status of each of the above process at the time of acquisition are further described in the following table status of acquired in process manufacturing technologies as of february  project percent of total cost to expected start of risk no 
completion development complete time to material net adjusted cost complete cash inflows discount rate  fiscal fiscal  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal all of the above processes were completed by march  and there were no significant variances to the original expected completion dates  projected original revenues and anticipated cost to complete the project 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for fiscal dollar increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of  additional staff  salary adjustment and related benefit of  commission on sales of  and consulting fees of  interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due to larger average cash and investment balance 
other income expense other expense of  for fiscal consist mainly of an impairment charge taken in the fourth fiscal quarter of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of an investment in a start up company 
in fiscal  other income of  consists primarily of gain on disposal of surplus equipment and sublease expenses net of sublease income 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at and respectively  of income before provision for income taxes 
financial condition overview total assets grew to  at the end of fiscal  up from  at the end of fiscal the increase was due primarily to profit generated from operations during the year 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared with  on march  and compared with  on march  our primary source of funds for fiscal  and has been the net cash generated from operating activities of   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of  consisted principally of net income of  and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  factors affecting cash flow from operating activities are as follows there was a decrease in accounts receivable of  primarily caused by the decline in net sales there was an increase in inventory of  there was an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of  due to high product returns in our foundry business there was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  due to lower operating cost resulting from lower sales volume there was a decrease deferred income taxes of  there was an increase in deferred revenue of  there was a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of  net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  which consisted primarily of  in purchase of equipment offset by proceeds from disposal equipment of  further offset by the proceeds of  from sale of long term investment 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options and espp of  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock in the amount of  as of march   the company s working capital was  which included approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
the company anticipates that the available funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal the company expects to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions during fiscal at the end of fiscal  we have commitments for the purchase as needed of raw materials  contract assembly  and chemicals of approximately  and for health insurance coverage of approximately  as needed  we also have commitments for line maintenance and advertising which are not material in amounts 
the company has commitments for non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income as follows fiscal year ended march operating lease sublease income certain relationships and related transactions we currently lease a portion of a building  consisting of approximately  sq 
ft at bordeaux drive  sunnyvale  california under an operating lease from fortuna realty co  a corporation owned by a former supertex director  yunni pao  expiring march   with options to renew 
the space is in turn subleased to our epitaxial deposition service provider at essentially the same cost 
previously we leased the entire building  consisting of approximately  sq 
ft 
the total rental expenses paid to fortuna realty co 
were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that the lease with fortuna realty co 
was and is at prevailing market rates

recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued fasb statements nos 
and fas and fas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
fas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under fas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
fas and fas are effective for all business combinations completed after june  upon adoption of fas  amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under fas will be reclassified to goodwill 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
the company adopted fas effective april  the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be realized in the period which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after june   but early adoption is encouraged 
the company has not yet determined the impact this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations  although it does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
this statement also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
among other things  fas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  fas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  but early adoption is encouraged 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed
