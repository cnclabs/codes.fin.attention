item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or co nditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable in the colors group are from domestic customers in the textile industry  which has been in a steady decline over the last several years 
if the financial condition of these or any other customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as with the accounts receivable  a significant portion of the company s inventories in the colors group are used by domestic customers in the textile industry 
in addition  most of the key raw materials are imported from asian countries causing the company to maintain significant amounts of inventory for certain products in order to adequately service the colors group s customers 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the elimination or reduction of their demand for our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note i to consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  will satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note i 
as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and remedy of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
subject to the difficulty in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts recorded is remote 
however  any changes  including regulatory changes  may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
the current liquidity ratio at year end was down from the year end ratios of and in and  respectively 
working capital decreased  to  from the previous year end 
cash flows from operations totaling  were derived primarily from declines in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively  and from earnings totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from the decline in sales experienced in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter last year  while the decline in inventories came primarily from planned reductions in the metals segment 
cash flows were used to fund capital expenditures of  to acquire assets of global chemical resources  for  see note q to consolidated financial statements  and to pay dividends of  the company uses a secured million bank line of credit to finance much of its current operations 
this line of credit expires on may  the company also has a million bank revolving line of credit with the same lender  which expires may  both loans are secured by the first lien on accounts receivable and inventory 
the company is in the process of negotiating replacement financing for both loans and  based on discussions with potential replacement lenders  expects to have replacement financing available by may  the company does not  however  have a written commitment for such financing 
the company anticipates that such financing will be at higher rates of interest than those charged on the existing loans 
other terms of the expected replacement credit facilities will be negotiated with the lender or lenders  and some of such terms may be less favorable to the company than those in the existing loans 
the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments  fund estimated capital expenditures of  and meet normal operating requirements 
results of operations metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements 
adjusted special charges amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income before environmental remediation costs environmental remediation costs operating income year end backlog piping systems comparison of to dollar sales for the year were down percent as the result of percent lower unit volumes coupled with a percent average decline in sales prices 
a change in product mix  with a lower percentage of sales coming from higher priced fabricated piping systems  led to about half of the fall in average selling prices 
the other half of the reduction in sales resulted from lower prices for raw materials and the generally competitive market conditions 
the unit volume decline was more than accounted for during the first half of the year when was characterized by weak markets and some inventory liquidation while the first six months of set record highs in unit volumes as the result of significant inventory building by our customers ahead of price increases 
operating income for was down percent from the prior year level 
during most of  our selling prices were in an uptrend and end use demand was enhanced by inventory building during the first half of the yea r 
these generally favorable conditions  together with substantial inventory profits from the rising prices  produced good profit margins 
unfortunately  was the mirror image of our selling prices trended downward during all of  leading to substantial inventory losses 
we estimate that raw material costs charged to cost of goods sold were approximately  more than our replacement costs during the year 
in addition  reduced demand led to more intense competition  which put further pressure on profit margins 
selling and administrative expense decreased  or percent 
however  it increased as a percent of sales to eight percent from seven percent compared to last year 
the significant decline in sales in compared to was greater than the corresponding decline in sales commissions and other selling and administrative costs over the same periods 
for information related to environmental matters  see note to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to while sales for the metals segment increased only one percent for the year  operating income before special and environmental charges was up a more robust percent 
unit volumes were down percent so the dollar sales increase came from a percent increase in average sales prices 
the big improvement in gross profits resulted from the higher prices and strong markets for stainless pipe in the first half of the year when our distributors were building inventories ahead of anticipated price increases 
the last half of suffered from a reversal to a mode of inventory liquidation among our distributors as prices began to trend downward 
selling and administrative expenses declined  or two percent  and improved slightly as a percent of sales compared with primarily from the elimination of administration costs incurred at the camden facility  which was closed in the first half of see note b to consolidated financial statements 
the special charge was recorded in the first quarter for the costs of closing the process equipment plant in camden  south carolina 
in addition   was added to the reserve for environmental remediation in the fourth quarter 
for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements 
chemicals segment adjusted special charges amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating loss income before environmental remediation costs environmental remediation costs operating loss income colors group adjusted special charges amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating loss income before environmental remediation costs environmental remediation costs operating loss income specialty chemicals group adjusted special charges amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating loss income augusta operating losses operating income excluding augusta losses comparison of to the eleven percent decline in colors group sales in resulted from the relentless and well chronicled downsizing of the domestic textile industry that has been evident since cost cutting efforts moderated the operating loss so that it was only two percent worse than a year earlier before the special charges in outlined in the table above and in the comparison of to below 
the textile industry downsizing has been faster and of greater magnitude than almost anyone forecast 
this has made it impossible for us to cut costs and downsize our own colors group operations fast enough to maintain profitability 
the majority of the decline in sales and operating loss came in the fourth quarter  as sales for the fourth quarter of declined  from the fourth quarter last year 
of the  loss experienced for   occurred in the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter results are discussed below in current conditions and outlook 
sales in the specialty chemicals group were down three percent because of generally weak economic conditions and some business lost because of the closure of the augusta  georgia plant 
on the other hand  sales from the acquisition of global chemical resources in july of helped minimize the decline 
the operating loss for was an improvement of percent from the prior year loss before special charges outlined in the table above and in the comparison of to below 
the reduced loss resulted from closing the augusta plant 
the weak economy  which appeared to decline steadily over the last half of  caused sales to reduce to levels causing the group to incur significant negative manufacturing variances at both of its plants 
this was offset somewhat at the mc cleveland plant in the second half of  when the manufacture of liquid products by the dalton plant was transferred to cleveland in july providing more through put and improving efficiency 
most of th e loss   of the  loss for  occurred in the fourth quarter and is discussed further in current conditions and outlook 
selling and administrative expense increased  or one percent  and increased as a percent of sales primarily from an increase in salary expense 
for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to the chemicals segment experienced a sales decline of seven percent for the year and an operating loss of  before deducting special charges totaling  and  in environmental remediation costs 
sales were down nine percent in the colors group 
the decline in sales resulted from a continuation of the trends that have been evident since of reduced unit volume demand and lower sales prices 
lower unit volume is the result of the downsizing in the domestic textile industry in response to cheap imports that have continued to capture a larger share of the market 
lower dye prices are primarily the result of increasing amounts of cheap imports from china and india and the intensely competitive market conditions 
the lower gross profit margins were due to the same factors that affected sales plus expected losses on our new line of vat dyes during the initial year of introduction 
the losses suffered from the development of our new line of vat dyes was an expected result of our strategy to provide all of the major dyes for coloring cotton which is the number one fiber used by the domestic textile industry 
although selling and administrative expense declined  consistent with the decline in sales  the poor gross profit performance resulted in the colors group having a  operating loss before the special and environmental charges 
the special charge was an inventory charge recorded to cover price decreases and off standard raw materials 
the environmental charges resulted from a revised estimate of the ultimate cost of sites remediation primarily at the augusta plant that closed in for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
the specialty chemicals group sales were down five percent for the year 
the operating loss before special charges of  for the year was caused by losses at the augusta plant of  excluding augusta  operating income before the special charges was  for  which represents a decrease from of  the significant decrease was primarily the result of higher raw material and utility costs  resulting from higher oil prices  which could not be passed on to our customers because of competitive conditions 
also contributing to the decreased profitability were modestly higher labor and overhead costs and a less favorable product mix 
the special charges include a  write off of fixed assets largely related to the discontinuance of a contract processing agreement covering a herbicide intermediate 
the write off amount was recorded net of a note receivable totaling  which will reimburse the company for part of the capital cost  and is being received in equal payments through june most of the equipment was at the augusta plant and management had originally planned to move it to the spartanburg plant 
however  in december  an agreement was reached to cancel the project 
during the second quarter of we discontinued production at the augusta plant after completing our product supply obligations 
a  provision was recorded to cover the costs related to the shut down 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  for cleaning up a chemical spill 
closing the augusta plant positions the company to better utilize its remaining facilities  which is expected to enhance future profitability 
see note b to consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expense in increased  or four percent  and one percent of sales compared to primarily from increases in salary expense and corporate cost allocations unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of these items 
comparison of to corporate expense declined  or percent to  the decline resulted primarily from two factors 
included in the special adjustments for is an unexpected  payment made under a contract related to a pre employment matter recorded in the first quarter of in addition   in outside consulting costs was expensed during related to the installation of a new data processing system 
other expense  net declined  as interest expense decreased  from decreases in borrowings and interest rates under the lines of credit with a bank 
the company also recognized gains from the sale of its whiting plant in camden  south carolina of  and  from the partial sale of one of its investments 
interest income increased  primarily from interest received under a metals segment s contract with a customer 
comparison of to the  increase  or percent increase in corporate expenses in resulted primarily from two factors 
included in the special charges is an unexpected  payment made under a contract related to a pre employment matter recorded in the first quarter of in addition   in outside consulting costs was amortized during related to the installation of a new data processing system currently being installed 
other expense  net increased  as interest expense increased  from increases in borrowings and interest rates under the lines of credit with a bank 
interest income also declined  due to the company having lower amounts of funds invested in compared to current conditions and outlook the metals segment s unit volumes were up seven percent for the fourth quarter of from a year earlier  but dollar sales of  were down percent from last year s comparable period total of  as the result of percent lower average selling prices 
most of the sales price decline came from the change in product mix to a much smaller proportion of piping systems with commodity pipe prices down a more modest seven percent 
operating income of  in s fourth quarter declined percent from  achieved a year earlier 
in addition to the factors affecting the year as mentioned in the year to year comparison  the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by very low sales and profits from our piping systems products 
the stainless steel pipe and fabricated piping systems businesses are inherently cyclical 
since  we have produced an outstanding average return on capital employed with very high returns during the cyclically strong per iods and adequate returns during the weak part of the cycle 
management believes we are well positioned to continue this trend 
however  our objective is to develop new product offerings and diversify our business so that earnings will be less volatile while continuing to produce an above average return on capital 
colors group sales in the fourth quarter of fared even worse than the first three quarters with a percent decline to  from  for the same period last year 
the operating loss of  for the fourth quarter was percent worse than last quarter s loss of  in before that year s special charges of  the last two months of the year were especially weak with sales far below the year s monthly average 
this led to volume related losses that resulted in the final quarter producing the bulk of s operating loss 
as previously stated  the textile industry downsizing has been faster and of greater magnitude than almost anyone forecast 
we are continuing to cut costs and downsize our own colors group operations in an effort to achieve profitability and generate cash flows from reduced working capital 
we believe we ended the year with a smaller  more efficient operation that should be able to compete effectively if the domestic indu stry stabilizes 
we have developed a modest amount of non textile business for our pigment colors and are attempting to grow this business aggressively 
aided by the dalton  georgia acquisition  fourth quarter sales in the specialty chemicals group totaling  and the operating loss of  were about the same as last year s fourth quarter amounts of  and  respectively  before that year s special charges of  however  excluding augusta  the group had operating income of  in the fourth quarter of before the special charges 
without dalton  the mc cleveland plant experienced weaker sales in november and december coupled with increased operating costs 
due to the timing of certain toll contracts  the mix of products produced at the bu spartanburg plant in the fourth quarter generated lower revenues and profit margins 
the combination of both of these factors caused the  decline in profitability compared to the fourth quarter of last year 
since we have been focused on developing specialty chemical business to reduce our dependence on textile colors 
we have been suc cessful in building this part of the chemicals segment as evidenced by the approximate equal size of the two groups at year end 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the construction of our hydrogenation and distillation project at spartanburg and began product production at the end of the year 
we are attempting to increase and complement our contract manufacturing at bu with these and other products to increase sales  leveling out production at this plant and increasing efficiency 
the acquisition of dalton expands this group s capabilities and markets and should allow us to add products at the bu plant as well as increase through put in the cleveland plant 
we believe specialty chemicals have good growth potential as economic conditions improve 
management is continuing its emphasis on reducing the capital utilized by non performing business units 
we are focusing on generating cash flows from these efforts that will allow us to seek other opportunities to generate returns acceptable to investors 
we recognize that any business that cannot produce profits at least equal to the cost of capital should be rationalized in some manner 
we will continue examining current operations as well as acquisition opportunities considering any transaction that is deemed advantageous to the long term interest of our shareholders
