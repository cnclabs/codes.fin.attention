item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company began operations in september and initially focused on the acquisition of producing properties 
as a result of the increasing availability of economic onshore d seismic surveys  the company began to obtain d seismic data and options to lease substantial acreage in and began to drill its d based prospects in the company drilled  and gross wells in the gulf coast region in  and respectively 
the company has budgeted to drill gross wells net in in the gulf coast region  however  the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon various factors  including the availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and industry partner issues  company cash flow  success of drilling programs  weather delays and other factors 
if the company drills the number of wells it has budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization are expected to increase and oil and gas operating expenses are expected to increase over levels incurred in the company has typically retained the majority of its interests in shallow  normally pressured prospects and sold a portion of its interests in deeper  over pressured prospects 
the financial statements set forth herein are prepared on the basis of a combination of carrizo and the entities that were a party to the combination transactions 
carrizo and the entities combined with it in the combination transactions were not required to pay federal income taxes due to their status as partnerships or subchapter s corporations  which are not subject to federal income taxation 
instead  taxes for such periods were paid by the shareholders and partners of such entities 
on may   carrizo terminated its status as an s corporation and thereafter became subject to federal income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company established a deferred tax liability in the second quarter of  resulting in a noncash charge to income of approximately million 
the company has primarily grown through the internal development of properties within its exploration project areas  although the company acquired properties with existing production in the camp hill project in late  the encinitas project in early and the la rosa project in the company made these acquisitions through the use of limited partnerships with carrizo or carrizo production  inc as the general partner 
in addition  in november the company acquired assets in wharton county  texas in the jones branch project area for approximately  during the second quarter of  the company formed ccbm  inc ccbm as a wholly owned subsidiary 
ccbm was formed to acquire interests in certain oil and gas leases in wyoming and montana in areas prospective for coalbed methane and develop such interests 
ccbm plans to spend up to million for drilling costs on these leases through december  percent of which would be spent pursuant to an obligation to fund million of drilling costs on behalf of rmg  from whom the interests in the leases were acquired 
ccbm drilled gross wells net and incurred total drilling costs of  through december  these wells typically take up to months to evaluate and determine whether or not they are successful 
ccbm has budgeted to drill gross net wells in prior to the offering  carrizo conducted its oil and natural gas operations directly  with industry partners and through the following affiliated entities carrizo production  inc  encinitas partners ltd  la rosa partners ltd  carrizo partners ltd 
and placedo partners ltd 
concurrently with the closing of the offering  combination transactions were closed 
the combination transactions consisted of the following i carrizo production  inc merged into carrizo  ii carrizo acquired encinitas partners ltd 
in two steps a carrizo acquired the limited partner interests in encinitas partners ltd 
held by certain of the company s directors and b encinitas partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  iii la rosa partners ltd 
merged into carrizo  and iv carrizo partners ltd 
merged into carrizo 
as a result of the merger of carrizo and carrizo partners ltd  carrizo became the owner of all of the partnership interest in placedo partners ltd 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that such capitalized costs in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a percent discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
based on oil and gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december  removed the necessity to record a ceiling writedown 
using prices in effect on december  the ceiling writedown would have been approximately  because of the volatility of oil and gas prices  no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a ceiling test writedown in future periods 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date

oil and natural gas operating expenses for increased to million from million in oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the addition of new oil and gas wells drilled and completed since december  offset by a reduction in costs on older producing fields 
operating expenses per equivalent unit in increased to

income taxes changed from a million benefit in to a million expense in based on improvements in the results which influence taxable income 
the company also adjusted its valuation allowance during on net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized 
this change in estimate resulted in a deferred income tax benefit adjustment of million which reduced the company s effective tax rate to eight percent in dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock decreased to none in from million in as a result of the redemption of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of as a result of this redemption  no such future charges will be accrued 
net income for increased to million from million in as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has made and is expected to make oil and gas capital expenditures in excess of its net cash flow from operations in order to complete the exploration and development of its existing properties 
the company will require additional sources of financing to fund drilling expenditures on properties currently owned by the company and to fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical cost on its exploration projects 
while the company believes that current cash balances and anticipated operating cash flow will provide sufficient capital to carry out the company s exploration plans  management of the company continues to seek financing for its capital program from a variety of sources 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms that would be acceptable to the company 
the company s inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
without raising additional capital  the company anticipates that it may be required to limit or defer its planned oil and gas exploration and development program  which could adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have included proceeds from the initial public offering  the december sale of subordinated notes  common stock and warrants  the sale of shares of series a preferred stock and warrants  the february sale of series b preferred stock and warrants  funds generated by operations  equity capital contributions  borrowings primarily under revolving credit facilities and funding under the palace agreement that provided a portion of the funding for the company s  and drilling program in return for participation in certain wells 
cash flows provided by operations after changes in working capital were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to the increase in trade accounts payable 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was due primarily to increases in production and commodity prices 
the company budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately million of which million is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys and land acquisitions and million of which is expected to be used for drilling activities in the company s project areas 
the company has budgeted to drill approximately gross wells seven net in the gulf coast region and gross net ccbm coalbed methane wells in the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon available financing  cash flow  availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and partner issues and other factors 
the company has continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows into increasing its d prospect portfolio  improving its d seismic interpretation technology and funding its drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company s drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells net in  gross wells net in and gross wells net in in the gulf coast region 
all of the gross wells net drilled by ccbm are awaiting evaluation before a determination can be made as to their success during november  the company entered into a one year contract with grey wolf  inc for utilization of a  horsepower drilling rig capable of drilling wells to a depth of approximately  feet 
the contract  which commenced in march  provides for a dayrate of  per day

ability to manage growth and achieve business strategy the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
the company has relied in the past and expects to continue to rely on project partners and independent contractors that have provided the company with seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services 
at december   the company had full time employees 
there will be additional demands on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and continued reliance by the company on project partners and independent contractors  and these strains on resources  additional demands and continued reliance may negatively affect the company 
the company s ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including its ability to obtain leases or options on properties for d seismic surveys  its ability to acquire additional d seismic data  its ability to identify and acquire new exploratory sites  its ability to develop existing sites  its ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  its ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of its drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  access to capital and other factors 
although the company intends to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources and to increase its ability to provide internally certain of the services previously provided by outside sources  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so or that it will be able to continue to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
the failure of the company to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties  including difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to enable the company to expand its seismic data acquisition and drilling program  or the reduced availability of project partners and independent contractors that have historically provided the company seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has only limited experience operating and managing field operations  and there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in doing so 
any increase in the company s activities as an operator will increase its exposure to operating hazards 
see business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
the company s lack of capital will also constrain its ability to grow and achieve its business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving growth or any other aspect of its business strategy

critical accounting policies oil and natural gas properties investments in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs directly associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
such costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  and drilling and completion equipment 
the company proportionally consolidates its interests in oil and gas properties 
during  the company also capitalized as oil and natural gas properties  of deferred compensation related to stock options granted to personnel directly associated with exploration activities 
no deferred compensation cost was capitalized in or additionally  the company capitalized compensation costs for employees working directly on exploration activities of   and  in  and  respectively 
oil and natural gas properties are amortized based on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
unevaluated properties are evaluated periodically for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
the depletion rate per thousand cubic feet equivalent mcfe for  and  was  and  respectively 
dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling test  which limits such costs to the estimated present value  discounted at a interest rate  of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization 
no write down of the company s oil and natural gas assets was necessary in  or based on oil and gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december  removed the necessity to record a ceiling writedown 
using prices in effect on december  the pretax writedown would have been approximately  because of the volatility of oil and gas prices  no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a ceiling test writedown in future periods 
depreciation of other property and equipment is provided using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
stock based compensation the company accounts for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under this method  the company records no compensation expense for stock options granted when the exercise price of those options is equal to or greater than the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
repriced options are accounted for as compensatory options using variable accounting treatment 
under variable plan accounting  compensation expense is adjusted for increases or decreases in the fair market value of the company s common stock 
variable plan accounting is applied to the repriced options until the options are exercised  forfeited  or expired unexercised 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended by sfas no

in accordance with the current transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recorded a cumulative effect transition adjustment of million net of related tax expense of million in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of its derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments at the date of adoption 
upon entering into a derivative contract  the company designates the derivative instruments as a hedge of the variability of cash flow to be received cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative is effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
any ineffectiveness in the relationship between the cash flow hedge and the hedged item is recognized currently in income 
gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge are recognized in earnings as oil and gas revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
all of the company s derivative instruments at january  and december  were designated and effective as cash flow hedges except for its positions with an affiliate of enron corp 
discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with future changes in its fair value recognized in future earnings 
the company typically uses fixed rate swaps and costless collars to hedge its exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
the company also formally assesses  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions 
the company s board of directors sets all of the company s hedging policy  including volumes  types of instruments and counterparties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by either the president or chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president  chief financial officer and chairman of the board 
the master contracts with the authorized counterparties identify the president and chief financial officer as the only company representatives authorized to execute trades 
the board of directors also reviews the status and results of hedging activities quarterly 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include depreciation  depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties and future income taxes 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production depletion and the ceiling test  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
concentration of credit risk substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
historically  the company has not experienced credit losses on such receivables 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices the company s revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company can produce economically 
oil and natural gas prices have declined in the recent past and there can be no assurance that prices will recover or will not decline further 
see business and properties marketing 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at percent 
application of this ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices were depressed for only a short period of time 
the company may be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
on december   the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of million because its carrying cost of proved reserves was in excess of the present value of estimated future net revenues from those reserves 
if additional write downs are required  they would result in additional charges to earnings  but would not impact cash flow from operating activities 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
based on oil and gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december   removed the necessity to record a ceiling writedown 
using prices in effect on december  the ceiling writedown would have been approximately  the company typically uses fixed rate swaps and costless collars to hedge its exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and crude oil

in november  the company had costless collars with an affiliate of enron corp  designated as hedges  covering  mmbtu of gas production from december through december the value of these derivatives at that time was  because of enron s financial condition  the company concluded that the derivatives contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
as required by sfas no 
 the value of these derivative instruments as of november  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified into earnings over the original term of the derivative instruments 
an allowance for the related asset was charged to other expense 
at december    remained in accumulated other comprehensive income

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a percent fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company engages periodically in certain limited hedging activities but only to the extent of buying protection price floors 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by the company related to these instruments were   and  or  and per mmbtu for the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its floating rate debt 
in regards to its revolving credit facility  the result of a percent fluctuation in short term interest rates would have impacted cash flow by approximately  financial instruments debt maturities 
the company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowing  subordinated notes payable and series b redeemable preferred stock 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank and vendor borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to the company for borrowings with similar terms 
maturities of the debt are  in   in   in and the balance in
