item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview lexmark international  inc international  and together with its subsidiaries  the company or lexmark is a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions including laser and inkjet printers  multifunction products  associated supplies and services for offices and homes 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms for business users and develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products 
in the past five years  the worldwide printer industry has seen growth in laser and inkjet printers as a result of the increasing penetration of personal computers and local area networks into home and office markets 
during this period  the company s own product mix has evolved  with its laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies representing an increasing percentage of its sales volume and revenue  particularly as the increasing base of installed lexmark printers generates additional revenue from recurring sales of supplies for those printers primarily laser and inkjet cartridges 
lexmark believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to projected overall market growth for to  despite a flat to slightly declining market from to the company experienced increases in market share in both the laser and inkjet printer categories in despite a difficult economic environment and an increasingly aggressive competitive market with respect to product pricing 
in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to selling price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  unit price reductions are partially offset by the tendency of customers to add optional features including network adapters  additional memory  paper handling and multifunction capabilities 
in the inkjet printer market  advances in color inkjet technology have resulted in printers with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
the greater affordability of color inkjet printers as well as the growth in the all in one category have been important factors in the growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser and inkjet printers continues to grow  management expects the market for supplies will grow as well  as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of the printers 
while profit margins on printer hardware have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure  the supplies are a relatively high margin  recurring business  which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriters and other impact supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
critical accounting policies and estimates lexmark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
likewise  the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required 
management also considers potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  involuntary turnover rate  rate of compensation increase and future health care costs  among other things  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension  postretirement and postemployment plans 
these estimates  if incorrect  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could experience potential significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential significant gains 
restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of  lexmark s management and board of directors approved a restructuring plan the restructuring that includes a reduction in the company s global workforce of up to percent 
this plan provides for a reduction in infrastructure and overhead expenses  the elimination of the company s business class inkjet printer  and the closure of an electronic card manufacturing facility in reynosa  mexico

the company also recorded million million  net of tax of associated restructuring related inventory write offs resulting from the company s decision to eliminate its business class inkjet printer  to limit the period over which the company will provide replacement parts for products no longer in production  and to exit the electronic card manufacturing business 
the inventory write offs are included in the cost of revenue line on the statements of earnings 
the accrued restructuring costs for employee separations of million are associated with approximately  employees worldwide from various business functions and job classes 
employee separation benefits include severance  medical and other benefits

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and resulted from the company s decision to abandon certain assets consisting primarily of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of the company s business class inkjet printers and electronic cards 
the charge for asset impairments is included in the restructuring and related charges line of the statements of earnings 
in total  the company expects the pre tax charge of million to result in cash payments of approximately million and non cash charges of approximately million 
the cash payments are primarily for employee separations and other exit costs 
restructuring activities are expected to be substantially completed during the year annual savings from the restructuring should approximate million  with about million being achieved in these savings will be used to offset competitive pricing impacts and for new investments 
during  lexmark s management and board of directors approved a plan to restructure its worldwide manufacturing and related support operations the restructuring 
the restructuring plan involved relocating manufacturing  primarily laser printers  to mexico and china  and reductions in associated support infrastructure 
restructuring and related charges of million million  net of tax were expensed during the fourth quarter of these charges were comprised of million of accrued restructuring costs related to separation and other exit costs  million related to asset impairment charges and million associated with a pension curtailment loss related to the employee separations 
the employee separation costs included severance  medical and other benefits 
the other exit costs were related to vendor and lease cancellation charges and demolition and cleanup costs associated with the company s manufacturing relocation 
the asset impairment charges resulted from the company s plans to abandon certain assets primarily buildings associated with the relocation of manufacturing and related support activities 
as of december   substantially all of the employees identified in the restructuring had exited the business and received separation benefits 
the following table presents a rollforward of the liabilities in millions incurred in connection with the and restructuring 
these liabilities are reflected as accrued liabilities in the company s consolidated statements of financial position

liquidity and capital resources lexmark s primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately million and million of its class a common stock during and  respectively 
in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient  the company has other potential sources of cash such as its revolving credit facility  accounts receivable financing program and other financing sources such as the public or private debt markets  which are discussed in greater detail below 
cash flows from operating activities in were million  compared to million in the decrease in was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital accounts  principally related to current liabilities 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased over due to favorable changes in working capital accounts 
the company has short term non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers which arise in the normal course of business and provide the company with continuity of supply and lower product cost 
if the company fails to anticipate customer demand properly  a temporary oversupply of inventory could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect gross margins 
the company has a million unsecured  revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
the interest rate on the credit facility ranges from to above london interbank offered rate libor  as adjusted under certain limited circumstances  based upon the company s debt rating 
in addition  the company pays a facility fee on the million of to based upon the company s debt rating 
the interest and facility fees are payable quarterly 
the million credit agreement  as amended  contains customary default provisions  leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  liens  mergers or consolidations and investments 
any amounts outstanding under the million credit facility are due upon the maturity of the facility on january  as of december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
the company has outstanding million principal amount of senior notes due may   which was initially priced at  to yield to maturity 
the senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens  sale leaseback transactions  mergers and sales of assets 
there are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time  at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement  as supplemented and amended  in whole or in part  at the option of the company 
a balance of million net of unamortized discount of million was outstanding at december  the company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements 
the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt 
however  a downgrade in the company s credit rating could adversely affect the company s ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
in february  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register million of debt securities 
the company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for capital expenditures  reduction of short term borrowings  working capital  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december less than after in millions total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual obligations in october  the company entered into a new agreement to sell its us trade receivables on a limited recourse basis 
the new agreement increased the maximum amount of financing available to million 
as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
the company bears a risk of bad debt losses on us trade receivables sold  since the company over collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables 
the company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold may not include amounts over days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
this facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold 
the facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which  if triggered  could adversely affect the company s liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables 
a downgrade in the company s credit rating could reduce the company s ability to sell trade receivables 
the facility expires in october  but requires annual renewal of commitments in october and at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and  due to the revolving nature of the agreement  million also remained outstanding 
the company s previous agreement to sell its us trade receivables on a limited recourse basis was amended in october  and the maximum amount of us trade receivables to be sold was increased from million to million 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and also remained outstanding 
at december  and  the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
at the company s annual meeting of stockholders on april   the stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its class a common stock from million to million shares 
in february  the company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its class a common stock for a total repurchase authority of billion 
this repurchase authority allows the company  at management s discretion  to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors 
during  the company did not repurchase shares of its class a common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million shares at prices ranging from to per share for an aggregate cost of approximately million  leaving approximately million of share repurchase authority 
as of march   the company has repurchased approximately million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately million  leaving approximately million of share repurchase authority 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures during the past three years were primarily attributable to capacity expansion  the support of new products and research and development facilities 
looking forward to  the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million primarily attributable to new product development  infrastructure support and the completion of capacity expansion projects initiated in prior years 
the capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenue derived from international operations  including exports from the united states  made up more than half of the company s consolidated revenue  with european revenue accounting for about two thirds of international revenue 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
certain of the company s latin american entities use the us dollar as their functional currency 
lexmark s operations in argentina were adversely impacted by currency devaluation in late this resulted in translation losses of approximately million in december the company has continued to experience translation losses as a result of further deterioration in argentina s currency  which could have an adverse impact in the future 
currency translation has significantly affected international revenue and cost of revenue  and although it did not have a material impact on operating income for the years and  the operating income was materially adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
the company attempts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
tax matters the company s effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the company s resolution with the internal revenue service on certain adjustments related to the intercompany allocation of profits 
as a result of this resolution  the company has reversed previously accrued taxes  reducing the tax provision in the fourth quarter of by million  which reduced the effective income tax rate by 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  the company s effective income tax rate was for the decrease in the income tax rate was primarily due to the effect of lower tax rates on manufacturing activities in certain countries 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  including million which are not expected to provide a future benefit because they are attributable to certain non us entities that are also taxable in the us new accounting standards in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  which provides that some sales incentives should be treated as reductions in revenue and other sales incentives should be classified as cost of sales 
in april  the eitf deferred the effective date for this issue to quarters beginning after december  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the eitf has discussed several issues related to loyalty programs and vendor payments to retailers in connection with the promotion of the vendor s products 
eitf  accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  addresses loyalty programs that offer awards consisting of the vendor s products or services 
in january  a consensus was reached on one of the five issues discussed 
the eitf concluded that offers to customers to rebate or refund a specified amount of cash that is redeemable only if the customer meets a specified cumulative level of revenue transactions should be recognized as a reduction of revenue 
the effective date for application of this consensus was set for no later than the quarter ending after february  adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products  addresses when consideration paid to a retailer should be classified as a reduction of revenue 
in april  a consensus was reached that consideration from a vendor to a purchaser of the vendor s products is presumed to be a reduction in the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue 
that presumption can be overcome and the consideration should be characterized as a cost incurred if certain criteria are met 
the consensus is effective for annual or interim financial statements beginning after december  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although it will result in a reclassification from selling  general and administrative expense to revenue 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the issuance of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
states that goodwill should not be amortized  but should be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
all other intangible assets should be amortized over their useful lives 
certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after december  these statements are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
however  the company actively manages its product costs and manufacturing processes in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases 
factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management  and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the company s future operating results or cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the company s future operating results 
since the second quarter of  the company has experienced weak markets for its products 
continued softness in these markets and uncertainty about the timing and extent of the global economic downturn by both corporate and consumer purchasers of the company s products could result in lower demand for the company s products 
weakness in demand may result in excess inventory for the company and or its reseller channel which may adversely affect its operating results 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that meet customers needs 
the markets for laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies are increasingly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company and its major competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and or technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their printers and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant price pressure 
price reductions on inkjet or laser printer products or the inability to reduce costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the company believes that one of its competitive advantages is its exclusive focus on printing solutions 
the entrance of a competitor that is also exclusively focused on printing solutions could offset this advantage and could have a material adverse impact on the company s strategy and financial results 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels to support the demand of its customers  and to address production and supply constraints  particularly delays in the supply of key components necessary for production  which may result in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand 
the company s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis 
delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs  the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs  the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  and variations in the cost of component parts  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place in the united states on september   and the potential for future terrorist attacks have created many political and economic uncertainties  some of which may affect the company s future operating results 
future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to such attacks  and other acts of war or hostility may affect the company s facilities  employees  suppliers  customers  transportation networks and supply chains  or may affect the company in ways that are not capable of being predicted presently 
revenue derived from international sales make up over half of the company s revenue 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets  in part  because of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company is beginning to rely more heavily on its international production facilities and international manufacturing partners for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products 
future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors  including  without limitation  if the company s international operations or manufacturing partners are unable to supply products reliably  if there are disruptions in international trade  if there are difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities from the company to its international operations or manufacturing partners  or if there arise production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the company 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in obtaining intellectual property rights  enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the company s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
the company markets and sells its products through several sales channels 
the company s future results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between or among its various sales channels 
the company has advanced a strategy of forming alliances and oem arrangements with many companies 
one such oem customer is compaq computer corporation compaq  which represented less than three percent of the company s revenue in  and the consummation of the hp compaq merger is likely to result in the loss of compaq as a customer 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including the loss of significant customers  manufacturing partners or suppliers  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly the trading of large blocks and intraday trading in the company s common stock  may affect the company s common stock price 
while the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations in connection with the preparation of its quarterly and annual reports  the company does not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this report 
the information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report  in any of the company s public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf 
the important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change  and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors 
by means of this cautionary note  the company intends to avail itself of the safe harbor from liability with respect to forward looking statements that is provided by section a and section e referred to above 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes is estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt
