item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we develop and market software solutions that enable our customers to interact more intelligently with their customers 
our solutions integrate and analyze information about customers  products and promotional activity to generate specific actions our customers can take to improve their marketing  selling  merchandising and advertising effectiveness  leading to increased revenue  improved profit  decreased costs and enhanced customer satisfaction 
we combine our software products with industry expertise and professional services to create highly focused  industry specific solutions that are designed to integrate with and add significant value to existing custom or purchased crm systems and processes 
we sell our solutions worldwide primarily through a direct sales force 
we license our products under various pricing plans  such as per user  per cpu  per site and per enterprise 
we generally grant licenses on a perpetual basis 
license fees for our products range from  to in excess of million 
we provide product maintenance pursuant to service agreements  the pricing of which is typically based on a percentage of the related product license fee and is generally paid in advance 
professional service fees for business consulting  implementation support  data warehousing and processing and educational services are generally priced on a time and materials basis 
in addition  we offer some of our products on a hosted basis 
charges for hosted product related services vary across service offerings  but generally include an initial set up fee and a recurring monthly charge based on usage 
from inception through late  we expanded our organization by hiring personnel in key areas  particularly marketing  sales and research and development 
our total number of employees was   and on december    and  respectively 
in march  we instituted a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with our business outlook and general economic conditions 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately  or positions throughout the organization  and recorded a charge of million to reorganize the company and exit certain facilities in various united states and international locations 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our workforce by employees and recorded an additional million restructuring charge 
as of december   we had employees 
we anticipate recording an additional  restructuring charge in the first quarter of we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million for the year ended december  including million in restructuring related charges  million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
this is compared to net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively including amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense of million in and including non cash stock compensation expense of million in 
these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services as well as a decline in our revenues beginning in the third quarter of we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we also expect to incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we do not expect to achieve profitability in our relatively limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be 
table of contents successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
prior to the third quarter of  we experienced significant sequential percentage quarterly growth in revenues 
we do not believe that prior revenue growth rates are indicative of future growth rates 
the kd acquisition in february  we acquired kd  a developer and marketer of advanced data analysis solutions for retailers 
in this transaction  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of kd in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and kd became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  stock options of kd were converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the kd acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  deferral of the effective date of a provision of statement of position and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we derive revenues from software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
maintenance includes telephone and web based technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services include project planning and management  implementation and testing  data analysis  data warehousing  user and partner training  consulting  product hosting and ongoing customer support 
for software arrangements that include multiple software products  maintenance or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered maintenance and services elements  as determined by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the remaining residual arrangement fee is recognized as software product revenue 
for software arrangements in which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements or when all elements have been delivered 
revenues from license fees are recognized when a non cancelable agreement has been executed  the product has been shipped or electronically delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as 
table of contents payments become due from the customer 
if we do not consider collection to be probable  then revenues are recognized when the fee is collected 
license revenues related to license terms of less than twenty four months are recognized ratably over the term of the license period 
when we offer our products and services on a hosted basis  up front set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
we recognize revenues allocable to maintenance ratably over the term of the agreement 
we evaluate arrangements that include professional and or data processing services to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
if services are considered essential  revenues from the arrangement are recognized using contract accounting  generally on a percentage of completion basis 
when we do not consider the professional services to be essential  we recognize the revenues allocable to the services as they are performed 
sublease income 
in conjunction with the restructuring related charges recorded in  we made certain estimates regarding future sublease income that have a significant impact on our anticipated cash obligations 
although we believe that our lease commitment estimates are appropriate in the current circumstances  future changes in real estate markets could impact the ultimate amount of cash paid to resolve these obligations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
litigation 
we have not recorded an estimated liability related to the class action lawsuit in which we are named 
for a discussion of this matter  see legal proceedings above and note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying amounts of property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  both purchased in the normal course of business and acquired through business combinations  to determine whether current events or circumstances  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  warrant adjustments to such carrying amounts 
in reviewing the carrying values of property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  we consider  among other things  the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition less the future cash outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows 
goodwill recorded from the kd acquisition in february is evaluated at the enterprise level 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment assessment include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will no longer amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an impairment review at least annually thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review no later than june  we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded

revenues from three customers represented  and of our total revenues in revenues from one customer represented of our total revenues in both and product revenues 
product revenues declined to million in from million in product revenues increased in from million in product revenues comprised   and of total revenues for  and the decrease in product revenues in was attributable to a combination of factors  including the rapid deterioration of internet retailers  a longer sales cycle due to our pursuit of larger transactions with larger organizations  increased competition  and the deferral of purchase decisions by our current and potential customers due to economic uncertainty 
prior percentage growth rates of our product revenues have not been sustainable and we do not currently expect to achieve such prior percentage growth rates in the future 
service and maintenance revenues 
service and maintenance revenues consist primarily of professional and maintenance services and  secondarily  product hosting services 
our professional service revenues include business consulting  implementation support  data warehousing and processing and educational services and are generally offered on a time and materials basis 
maintenance revenues are generally derived from annual service agreements and are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
service and maintenance revenues decreased to million in from million in service and maintenance revenues increased in from million in service and maintenance revenues comprised  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in service and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars in reflects lower levels of consulting and maintenance services due to the combined effect of fewer new customer acquisitions and a decline in our customer base  particularly internet retailers 
prior percentage growth rates of our service and maintenance revenues have not been sustainable and we do not currently expect to achieve such prior percentage growth rates in the future 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of royalties paid to third party vendors  amortization of acquired technology costs  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expenses 
cost of product revenues decreased to  in from million in cost of product revenues increased in from  in cost of product revenues represented  and of related product revenues in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of acquired technology cost in connection with our acquisition of kd in february and to reduced product revenues and royalties payable to third parties 
since all internal development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products have been expensed as incurred  cost of product revenues includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
we believe that the cost of product revenues will decline as a percentage of product revenues in as we decrease our reliance on licensed third party technology 
cost of service and maintenance revenues 
cost of service and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel related and infrastructure costs incurred in providing telephone and web based support of our software products  as well as professional  consulting  educational and hosted product related services to customers 
cost of service and maintenance revenues decreased to million in from million in cost of service and maintenance revenues increased in from million in cost of service and maintenance revenues in  and represented  and of the related services and maintenance revenues  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in compared to prior years is primarily due to headcount reductions in our service organization as a result of our march and third quarter restructuring and decreased use of third party consultants to staff 
table of contents consulting engagements 
cost of service and maintenance revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of services that we provide and the utilization rate of our service personnel 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  commissions and other incentive compensation  travel and entertainment and expenditures for marketing programs  such as collateral materials  trade shows  public relations and creative services 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in compared to million in sales and marketing expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in was primarily due to headcount reductions as a result of our restructuring efforts and decreased spending on marketing programs 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts in reflected the cost of hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  developing and expanding our sales and distribution channels  launching new products and expanding promotional activities 
research and development

research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in is primarily due to headcount reductions as a result of our restructuring efforts

general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars in due primarily to lower headcount as a result of our restructuring efforts 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollar amounts in reflected the cost of hiring additional general and administrative personnel  increased professional fees  additional provision for doubtful accounts and additional infrastructure to support our expanding operations 
lease abandonment expense 
lease abandonment expenses relate to our august abandonment of our previous headquarters facility upon our move to new corporate headquarters 
we recorded lease abandonment expense totaling  in  representing of total revenues compared to lease abandonment expense totaling approximately million in  representing of total revenues 
the additional  of lease abandonment expense recorded in was in response to declining conditions in the minneapolis area real estate market 
in october  we entered into an agreement to sublease the majority of our previous headquarters facility to a third party 
restructuring related charges 
we recorded restructuring related charges totaling million in  representing of total revenues 
in march  we instituted a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with our business outlook and general economic conditions 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately  or positions throughout the organization  and recorded a restructuring related charge of million to reorganize the company and exit certain facilities in various united states and international locations 
this million charge included million related to facility consolidation  million of employee termination costs and 
table of contents million of losses on the disposal of assets and other restructuring charges 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our workforce by employees and recorded an additional million restructuring related charge 
this million charge included  for estimated losses on the disposal of fixed assets   for leasehold write offs related to facility consolidation and  for employee severance payments 
during the fourth quarter of  we decreased the total restructuring charge by  to reflect the actual costs of exiting certain marketing activities in connection with the restructuring

amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangibles acquired in the february acquisition of kd was million and million including  and million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles included in the cost of product revenues in and  respectively 
this represented and of and total revenues  respectively 
total amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is expected to be significantly lower for and through the first quarter of due to the million impairment of goodwill and other intangibles charge recorded in the first quarter of discussed below and our scheduled adoption of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   under which we will no longer amortize goodwill 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
at march   we performed an impairment assessment of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of kd the assessment was performed primarily due to lower than expected revenues in the first quarter of product revenues declined from the same period in and from the fourth quarter of and a downward revision in the first quarter of of our internal projections based on the general economic conditions in the information technology sector  combined with changes in valuation models for technology companies  a continued decline in our first quarter stock price and our march plan of restructuring 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
the charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the goodwill and other intangible assets  a terminal value at the end of this estimated life and using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated terminal value were determined using management s best estimates available at the time the impairment assessment was made 
the estimated cash flows were consistently based on our internal operating plan 
the discount rate was based upon the historical time weighted returns for venture capital type investments for the ten year period ended december  a rate considered appropriate given our recent revenue levels 
the estimated terminal value was based on our recent revenue multiple based on trailing twelve months revenues as objectively observed from the stock market s valuation of the company 
in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning january   we will no longer amortize goodwill and certain other intangibles  resulting in a reduction of annual amortization expense of approximately million in instead  we will test these assets at least annually for impairment 
amortization expense related to other intangible assets is expected to be  and  for and the first quarter of  respectively 
however  as noted above  the remaining unamortized goodwill and intangible asset not subject to amortization of million are subject to periodic impairment analysis  which could require a write down of these assets in the future

net other income decreased to million in from million in net other income increased in from million in the decrease in net other income in compared to 
table of contents was primarily due to a decrease in interest income earned on the proceeds from our follow on public offering completed in march provision for income taxes we have incurred significant operating losses for all periods from inception through december  as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income expiring at various dates beginning in in addition  as of december   we had  of tax credit carry forwards expiring at various dates beginning in under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if certain substantial changes in our ownership were to occur  we could be limited in the future in the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards that could be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  as the realization of the future tax benefit is presently not likely

a total of million in net cash was provided from investing activities for the year ended december   compared to a cash use of million in and a cash use of million in our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and marketable securities and property and equipment 
to date  we have not invested in financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
we will continue to invest cash in excess of current requirements in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
net cash used for financing activities was  for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was million in  reflecting the receipt of net proceeds from our follow on public offering 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  reflecting the 
table of contents million of net proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings under a short term convertible note payable 
capital expenditures were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures consisted of leasehold improvements and purchases of property and equipment  primarily computer equipment  software and furniture 
capital expenditures were higher in prior years and reflected our rapidly growing employee base and expanded operations infrastructure 
in april  we signed a ten year lease for a new corporate facility in edina  minnesota  with annual total rent payments beginning at million per year  excluding operating expenses 
the move to the new headquarters facility was completed in august and required a net investment in of approximately million in leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment 
as part of our march and third quarter restructuring  we recorded restructuring related charges of million in a total of million was charged against the restructuring reserve as of december   lowering the accrued restructuring liability to million 
these charges included million of non cash leasehold write offs  million of other non cash fixed assets write offs  million in employee severance payments  million in rent payments   of real estate broker fees and  in other office consolidation expenses 
these charges were partially offset by a million application of deferred rent against the charge   of proceeds on the sale of fixed assets and  of sublease income 
of the million restructuring reserve remaining as of december   management estimates that approximately million will be a use of cash in future periods for remaining rent commitments and other carrying costs  less estimated sublease income  related to facilities we have vacated 
cash payments related to the restructuring are expected to total up to million in  less any benefit from incremental real estate subleasing activities 
the remaining  of accrued restructuring costs relates to non cash items 
although we believe that our lease commitment estimates are appropriate in the current circumstances  future changes in real estate markets could impact the ultimate amount of cash paid to resolve these obligations 
as of march   we have signed agreements to sublease approximately  square feet of our existing facilities through the remaining terms of the respective leases 
we are actively seeking to sublease our remaining excess facilities 
specifically  we are currently seeking to sublease an additional portion of our headquarters facility  our entire roseland  new jersey office space and a portion of our office space in austin  texas 
however  there is a risk that we may not be able to sublease these facilities under favorable terms  if at all  which could negatively impact our cash flow and future operating results 
as of december   we had no material long term commitments for capital expenditures 
since  we have purchased property and equipment with cash 
from inception through  we generally funded the purchase of property and equipment with capital leases 
at december   we had  in short and long term liabilities  of which approximately  comprised deferred rent credits 
approximately  of the short and long term liabilities represent loans  consisting primarily of capital lease obligations 
these obligations include installment loans with third party financing sources that are secured by the equipment financed by the third parties 
the loans bear interest at rates between and and mature between february and august the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
thereafter capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents operating lease obligations relate to our existing facilities 
as of march   we have signed agreements to sublease approximately  square feet of our existing facilities 
under the terms of the sublease agreements currently in effect  we expect to receive sublease payments of     and  in    and thereafter  respectively 
however  there is a risk that one or more of the subtenants may breach the terms of the sublease agreements  which could negatively impact our cash flow and future operating results 
we believe that existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 

table of contents risks that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are an early stage company and we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we were founded in july we began shipping products in the first quarter of the market for our products is unproven and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our future prospects very difficult 
we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not successfully address any of these risks 
if we do not successfully address these risks  we may not achieve profitability and we could suffer increased operating losses 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
because our operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
historically  our operating results have been below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will again be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
we cannot predict our future quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty for a variety of reasons  because we operate with a limited order backlog  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter  the market in which we compete is relatively new and rapidly evolving and has many new entrants  we expect that  for the foreseeable future  revenues will come from sales to a small number of customers  so delays or cancellations of orders by a few customers can significantly impact revenues within a quarter  our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer  and the timing of large orders can significantly affect revenues within a quarter 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of the quarter 
accordingly  we cannot predict our financial results for any quarter until very late in the quarter 
a delay in an anticipated sale or revenue recognition near the end of a quarter can seriously harm our operating results for that quarter 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based  in part  on our expectations as to our future revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenues could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in increased operating losses 

table of contents our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
the us economy is much weaker now then it has been in recent history  and may be in recession for the remainder of  if not longer 
a general economic slowdown could have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results 
for example  an economic slowdown may cause some current or potential customers to defer purchases  to go out of business or to have insufficient capital to buy our products 
an economic slowdown could also cause a significant reduction in the value of our investments 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a history of losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we had net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in including million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of kd and non cash stock compensation expense and million including million in restructuring related charges  million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense and a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of kd for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not had a profitable quarter and do not expect to have a profitable quarter in we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
we may never achieve profitability 
a decline in the price of  demand for  or market acceptance of our products would seriously harm our business 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from two products personalization manager and advertising advisor 
we anticipate that these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of or demand for these products  or their failure to achieve broad market acceptance  would result in decreased revenues and increased operating losses 
we face intense competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully  we may be unable to increase our product sales and market share 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include core technology  product features  product quality and performance  customer service and price 
although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors  our market is relatively new and is rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with current and potential customers of ours  have extensive knowledge of our industry and are capable of offering a single vendor solution 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  current and potential 
table of contents competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
also  relationships with large systems integrators such as accenture  large consulting firms and others are an important factor in successfully achieving widespread deployment of these solutions 
many of our competitors have such relationships in place today  and this may hinder our ability to gain equivalent access to systems integration resources 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
we may need to make acquisitions to remain competitive 
a component of our business strategy is to seek to buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired business  product or technology may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the quarter in which a sale may occur 
our solutions are relatively new to the marketplace 
as a result  we must use significant resources to educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  we believe that the purchase of our products is relatively discretionary and involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
as a result  it usually takes our sales organization several months to finalize a sale 
this makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which a sale may occur 
our products have a lengthy implementation cycle 
in addition  only a limited number of our customers have a deployed and operating application that utilizes our products 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our products will perform and be received as expected 
the implementation  including application design and deployment  of our products requires a commitment of resources by our customers 
the time required for implementation of our products has varied depending on the customer s application of the product 
we have licensed one or more of our products to more than customers 
however  only a limited number of these customers have a fully deployed operating application that utilizes our products 
in addition  a significant number of internet retailer customers have gone out of business  and are no longer utilizing our products 
because many of our customers have not yet fully implemented and deployed our products  we cannot be certain that our products will perform as designed  deliver the desired level of economic benefit to our customers  meet the other expectations and needs of our customers  achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  or perform to the level necessary to generate repeat customers and customer references 

table of contents if implementation services performed by us constitute a significant part of a product sales transaction  we recognize a substantial portion of our revenues from the sales transaction upon the delivery of the implementation services 
as a result  delays in service delivery could cause significant reduction in our license revenues and operating results for any particular period 
we have several new products which may not achieve market acceptance 
since january  we have announced the commercial launch of several new or enhanced products including personalization manager  advertising advisor  retail analyst and distribution analyst 
in addition  we expect to introduce new and enhanced products during these products have not received a significant degree of market acceptance 
there are significant risks inherent in product introductions such as these 
these products may not address some or all of the needs of customers and may contain undetected errors or failures 
a lack of necessary features or errors or failures in the products will likely result in loss or delay of market acceptance 
we expect that our future financial performance will depend significantly on the successful sales  implementation and market acceptance of these new or enhanced products which may not occur on a timely basis or at all 
our new products are subject to significant technical risks 
we may fail to introduce or deploy new products on a timely basis  or at all 
in the past  we have experienced some delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our new releases and new products 
these delays caused customer frustrations and delay or loss of product revenues 
some of our competitors currently offer products with features and functionality similar to those of some of our new products 
in the past  we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by customers anticipating our launch of new releases or new products 
we could experience increased expenses or lost revenues if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions 
the software products we offer are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced  or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction 
we experienced delays in release and lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
we may discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments  despite testing by our personnel and our current and potential customers 
this may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could seriously impair our ability to achieve profitability 
acts of terrorism or war may hurt global economic conditions  which could harm our business 
our business is subject to and affected by forces  pressures and events affecting global economic conditions 
the september  terrorist attacks exacerbated global economic conditions and adversely impacted many businesses  including that of net perceptions 
since the terrorist attacks  we have experienced delays in closing significant business transactions 
we believe these delays have resulted  at least in part  from the terrorist attacks 
future terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers and suppliers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to generate repeat or expanded business from our current and future customers  we may be unable to build a critical mass of customers necessary to achieve increased sales and market share 
our success is dependent on the continued growth of our customer base and the retention of our customers 
we currently depend on a limited number of key  high profile customers 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the accuracy  scalability  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products and services and our ability to effectively market such products and services 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
many of our current customers initially purchase a limited 
table of contents license for our products and services for evaluation 
if such evaluation is successful  the customer may purchase a license to expand the use of our products in its organization or license additional products and services 
if we fail to generate repeat and expanded business from our current and future customers  we may be unable to build a critical mass of customers necessary to achieve increased sales and market share 
if we fail to substantially expand our direct sales operations  we may be unable to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers 
as of december   our direct sales organization consisted of employees 
we may need to hire additional direct sales personnel in the future 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting 
new hires will require extensive training and typically take several months to achieve productivity 
we cannot be certain that our recent hires will be as productive as necessary 
if we are unable to hire additional skilled sales personnel as needed  we may not be able to capture increased market share for our products and services 
if we cannot expand our indirect sales channel  we may be unable to increase our customer base and achieve profitability 
we intend to increase the proportion of our customers licensed through our indirect channel  which includes resellers  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
our agreements with resellers are generally not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of these resellers do not have minimum purchase or resale requirements 
in addition  many of these resellers carry product lines that are competitive with our product lines 
these resellers may not give a high priority to the marketing of our products or may not continue to carry our products 
they may give a higher priority to other products  including the products of competitors 
we may not retain any of our current resellers or successfully recruit additional resellers 
events or occurrences of this nature could seriously impair our ability to increase our sales and market share 
in addition  any sales through resellers will have lower gross margins than direct sales 
we have established an effort dedicated to the development of the indirect sales channel for our products 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to retain our existing personnel 
we cannot be certain that our recent hires will be as productive as necessary 
if we are unsuccessful in improving and increasing the size of our professional services organization  we may lose current customers or be unable to attract new customers 
customers that license our software typically engage our professional services organization to assist with support  training  consulting and implementation 
we believe that growth in our product sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with these services and to educate resellers on how to use our products 
from time to time  we receive customer complaints about the timeliness and accuracy of our customer support 
as of december   our professional services and customer support organization consisted of employees 
there are a limited number of people who have the skills needed to provide the services that our customers demand 
competition for qualified service personnel is intense 
we cannot be certain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of the highly qualified service personnel that our business needs 
we depend on international sales and  therefore  our business is susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations 
licenses and services sold to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total revenues in  in and in we expect international revenues to 
table of contents account for a significant percentage of total revenues in the future  and we believe that we must retool and expand our international sales and marketing activities in order to be successful 
to successfully expand international sales we must retool and expand our international operations  hire international personnel  and recruit additional international resellers and systems integrators 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources and could seriously harm our operating margins 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling  distributing and supporting our products and services internationally 
international operations are generally subject to a number of other risks as well  including expenses associated with customizing products and services for foreign countries  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and political and economic instability 
in  we established operations in the united kingdom and established operations in japan through a joint venture that created net perceptions japan 
as of december   we had four employees located in the united kingdom and one employee located in canada 
all other employees were located in the united states 
we may be unable to sublease or find suitable tenants for a portion of our principal executive offices and some of our other offices 
in april  we executed a ten year lease for a new facility for our principal executive offices in edina  minnesota 
we have sublet a significant portion of this facility to third parties and are currently seeking to sublease an additional portion of this facility 
we have also sublet all of the space at our berkshire  united kingdom facility and a portion of the space at our san francisco  california facility 
we are also currently seeking to sublease our roseland  new jersey office space and a portion of our office space in austin  texas 
we may not be able to find suitable sub tenants for these properties in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants in a timely manner  we may experience greater than anticipated operating expenses in the future 
if our intellectual property is not protected adequately  we may lose our competitive advantage in the market 
we are a technology company 
our success depends in large part on protecting our intellectual property  which is our most important asset 
we rely upon a combination of trademark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws to protect our rights in our technology 
we license our software and require our customers to enter into license agreements  which impose restrictions on our customers ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets  including but not limited to requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and restricting access to the source code for our software 
we have pending united states patent applications and three issued united states patents 
we also have license rights to three issued united states patents from the university of minnesota and one 
table of contents allowed united states patent application 
it is possible that no patents will issue from the currently pending patent applications 
it is also possible that our current patents and potential future patents may be invalid or unenforceable 
it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages 
moreover  we may not develop future proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  and the patents of others may seriously limit our ability to conduct our business 
in this regard  we have not performed any comprehensive analysis of patents of others that may limit our ability to conduct our business 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed 
copyright and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  documentation and other written materials 
unauthorized parties may be able to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as confidential and proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
we may not be able to detect infringement or enforce our patent or other rights and  as a result  our competitive position in the market may suffer 
third party infringement claims against us or our technology suppliers could result in delays in product development  the loss of customers  or costly and time consuming litigation 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time received claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
we expect that software companies such as net perceptions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to secure continued access to required technology 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to pay significant damages or subject us to an injunction against the use of our products 
any successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us could have an immediate and significant impact on our ability to carry on our business and market our products 
in addition  in all of our paid software license agreements  we generally indemnify our customers against losses attributable to intellectual property infringement by our software 
should a third party bring a suit against a customer alleging that the customer s use of our software infringes its intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial costs in defending and resolving the suit 
if we are unable to continue to utilize technology licensed from third parties  we may be unable to conduct our business 
we license technology from various third parties for integration into our products 
licenses to such third party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
we may not be able to renew existing agreements or to license or develop alternative technology 
if we cannot maintain license rights to key third party software  develop similar technology or license similar technology from another source on a timely or commercially feasible basis  we may be unable to market our current products or develop new products in a timely manner 

table of contents our ability to increase our customer base and our sales depends on the continuing contribution of our key personnel and our ability to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel 
our future success depends on the continued service of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our ability to increase our customer base and sales 
as of december   we had employees 
we do not carry any key person life insurance policies 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  hire  train and retain a substantial number of highly skilled managerial  technical  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may fail to retain our key employees  or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
if so  we may be unable to service our current customers  attract new customers and increase our sales 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
to the extent this volatility and fluctuation continues  equity based compensation policies and plans  which have historically been significant in our attracting  hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel  may not be as effective as in the past 
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
we believe we have sufficient cash and investments to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds as needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
future sales of our common stock could depress its market price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  or there is a belief that such sales could occur  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding  shares of common stock and options to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock  of which  were exercisable 
substantially all of our outstanding shares are freely tradeable and all shares acquired upon exercise of options will be freely tradeable 
those shares which are not freely tradeable may be resold publicly at any time  subject to the volume and other restrictions of rule under the securities act 
if large numbers of these shares are sold over a short period of time  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders 
the market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following  some of which are beyond our control actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new technological innovations  increased cost of operations or new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the industries into which we sell our products and services  
table of contents changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other comparable companies  volatility in the stock markets  particularly with respect to technology stocks  and decreases in the availability of capital for technology related businesses  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of additional shares of common stock  and potential litigation 
from april  the first day of public trading of our common stock  through december   the high and low sales prices for our common stock fluctuated between and 
on march   the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
on november   timothy j 
fox filed a purported class action lawsuit against us  fleetboston robertson stephens  inc  the lead underwriter of our initial public offering in april  several other underwriters who participated in our initial public offering  steven j 
snyder  our then president and chief executive officer  and thomas m 
donnelly  our chief financial officer and chief operating officer 
for a discussion of this matter  see the section of this report entitled legal proceedings 
we may in the future be the target of other similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
we may be subject to potential product liability claims that could result in costly and time consuming litigation 
because our customers use our products for important applications  errors or defects in  or other performance problems with  our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek damages for losses from us 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
any product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly  and potential liabilities could exceed our available insurance coverage 
our current revenue recognition practices may need to change  which could seriously harm our business 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  software revenue recognition  in october and amended it by statements of position and there may be additional pronouncements issued in the future 
our current revenue accounting practices may need to change and such changes could seriously harm our future revenues and earnings 
provisions of our corporate organizational documents and rights agreement could delay or prevent a change of control  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  the rights issued under our rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and rights agreement could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 

table of contents our business could be seriously impacted by privacy and security concerns 
in some cases  our customers capture user preference and profile information each time a user interacts with the application utilizing our products or volunteers information in response to survey questions 
our customers generally have implemented security measures to protect such customer data from unauthorized disclosure or interception by third parties 
however  the security measures may not be effective against all potential security threats 
if a breach of customer data security were to be publicized  our products may be perceived as less desirable  and our future sales could be negatively impacted 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy and security concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten such concerns if  for example  our customers were required to notify users that the data captured after these interactions may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to that user 
legislation has been proposed at the federal and state levels that address some aspect of the internet  including a number of bills that specifically address internet privacy matters 
such proposed legislation indicates that some federal and state legislators believe that certain aspects of the internet and e commerce  including data privacy  are appropriate matters for regulation and review 
various other countries and political entities  such as the european union  have adopted legislation or regulatory requirements addressing issues  such as data privacy  that may directly impact some of our customers 
if user privacy concerns are not adequately addressed or if restrictive legislation is adopted in the united states  our business could be seriously harmed and we could experience increased operating losses 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and we could lose our competitive advantage in the market 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new software product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to be successful  we need to develop and introduce new software products and enhancements to existing products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards  and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
in addition  we may fail to develop and market new products and enhancements to existing products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and enhancements to existing products  and fail to develop new products and enhancements to existing products that adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
if any of these events occur  we may be unable to compete successfully in the market for our products and services  and as a result  our business could fail 
the growth of the market for our products and services would be impaired if the use of the internet and electronic commerce do not grow as anticipated  and third parties do not continue to develop and improve the internet infrastructure 
our future revenues depend  in part  upon the increased acceptance and use of the internet and other on line services as a medium of commerce 
rapid growth in the use of the internet  the web and 
table of contents on line services is a recent phenomenon 
acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet and other on line services as a medium of commerce 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and few proven services and products exist 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a viable long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant expansion in the number of users  frequency of use or bandwidth requirements  the infrastructure for the internet may be unable to support the demands placed upon it 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in  or insufficient availability of  telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet generally 
the growth of the market for our products and services would be impaired if use of the internet  the web and other on line services does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  the infrastructure for the internet  the web and other on line services does not effectively support expansion that may occur  or the internet  the web and other on line services do not become a viable commercial marketplace  which would inhibit the development of electronic commerce and of the need for our personalization manager product 
increasing government regulation could limit the market for our products and services  which could seriously impair the growth of our business or expose us to unanticipated liabilities 
as internet commerce evolves  we expect that federal  state or foreign governmental authorities will enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
if enacted  such laws  rules or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although many of these regulations may not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal customer information could indirectly affect our business 
our common stock may be delisted from nasdaq 
we may fail to maintain the minimum closing bid price of for consecutive business days as required by the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to demonstrate compliance with this or any other nasdaq requirement  nasdaq may take further action with respect to a potential delisting of our common stock 
we may appeal any such decision by nasdaq to the nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
if our common stock were delisted from nasdaq this could result  among other things  in a number of negative implications  including reduced liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with nasdaq  as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  the loss of analyst coverage and institutional investor interest  fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk through december   the majority of our recognized revenues were denominated in united states dollars and were primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that future product license 
table of contents and service revenues may increasingly be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
our exposure to market risk is otherwise limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in debt securities issued by corporations and the united states government 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate risk is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities in addition to debt and have adopted practices and policies to ensure that our portfolio remains adequately diversified 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest risk is mitigated 
furthermore  we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not hold any instruments for trading purposes
