currency fluctuations ashworth uk  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  operating in england  maintains its books of account in british pounds and ashworth canada  a division of the company  operating in montreal  canada  maintains its books of account in canadian dollars 
for consolidation purposes  the assets and liabilities of ashworth uk  ltd 
and ashworth canada are converted to us dollars at the month end exchange rate and results of operations are converted using an average rate during the month

ashworth uk  ltd

all export revenues by ashworth  inc are us dollar denominated and ordinarily there is no transaction adjustment for currency exchange rates for the company 
however  with respect to export revenues to ashworth uk  ltd 
and ashworth canada  the foreign entities are at risk on their indebtedness to ashworth  inc the foreign entities maintain their accounts with ashworth  inc  in british pounds or canadian dollars  but owe ashworth  inc in us dollars

new accounting standards effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and resulting designation of the derivative 
for derivatives designated as hedges  changes in the fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the assets or liabilities through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income in the balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized into earnings 
for the year ended october   the company did not engage in any hedging activities and was not a party to any derivative instruments 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending january  to accomplish this  the company must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require the company to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  the company will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
because of the effort necessary to comply with the adoption of sfas no 
 it is not practicable for management to estimate the impact of adopting this statement at the date of this report 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersede accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet one of the two criteria  as defined in the statement 
this statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  under sfas no  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment 
separable intangible assets with defined lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the provisions of sfas no 
will apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired before and after the statement s effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we plan to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year we are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s debt consists of notes payable with a total balance of  at october  the debt bears interest at variable and fixed rates ranging from to  which approximates fair value based on current rates offered for debt with similar risks and maturities 
the company also has  outstanding on its revolving line of credit with interest charged at the bank s reference prime rate minus one half of one percentage point 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates during the year ended october  would have resulted in a  decrease in net income 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for the company s products or losses from currency exchange rates 
although the company and its subsidiaries did not do so during fiscal  from time to time  the company enters into short term foreign exchange contracts with its bank to hedge against the impact of currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound 
the contracts provide that  on specified dates  the company would sell the bank a specified number of british pounds in exchange for a specified number of us dollars 
additionally  the company s subsidiary in england enters into similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the british pound and other european currencies 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction 
these contracts have maturity dates that do not normally exceed months 
the company will continue to assess the benefits and risks of strategies to manage the risks presented by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there is no assurance that any strategy will be successful in avoiding losses due to exchange rate fluctuations  or that the failure to manage currency risks effectively would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as of october  the company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
