the effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower effective rate for the year ended december  is the result of permanent differences between book income and tax income and the effect of state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position on december  was million compared to million at december  working capital increased million to million at december  from million at december  net cash of million provided by operating activities during and million of asset sales funded debt service requirements and capital expenditures 
total long term debt  including capital lease commitments and the current portion of debt and lease commitments  decreased million from december  to million at december  in july  the company executed a revised credit agreement with its lending group  which originally provided for a million revolving credit facility and a million secured term credit facility  secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at december   million was outstanding on the secured term credit facility  and million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility  and no further borrowing is permitted under either facility  nor is other borrowing permitted 
the current interest rate on these facilities is libor plus  an effective rate of at february  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
the secured term credit facility is payable in equal installments of million payable quarterly beginning on march   and a final payment of million due on september  no payments are due on the revolving credit facility in  but the facility converts to a term loan on january   with scheduled quarterly installments of approximately million  payable beginning march  and a final balance of million due january  the company intends to restructure its debt as discussed below 
capital expenditures in totaled million and primarily consisted of purchase and completion of aircraft improvements and engines 
also included in capital expenditures were the exercise of purchase options on certain leased aircraft million  purchase of a number of aircraft on operating leases for resale million  equipment and leasehold improvements related to the new lafayette facility million and purchase of customer specified new aircraft million 
in addition to debt service and capital expenditures  the company funded million of construction costs in for its new operating facility  pursuant to the terms of a year lease of the facility that became effective september the funding is treated under the lease as prepaid rent and amortized over years at per annum  thus reducing phi s monthly cash lease payments for the first years of the lease 
phi has no additional funding commitments under the lease 
in the company s cash flow was substantially augmented from the proceeds of the sale of aircraft 
the company expects the fleet size to remain substantially unchanged in  but may have some sales to strategically adjust the fleet of aircraft 
nonetheless  the company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund required debt service and the reduced level of capital expenditures during the table below sets out the cash contractual obligations of the company 
the operating leases are not recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  but payments are treated as an expense as incurred 
each contractual obligation included in the table contains various terms  conditions  and covenants which  if violated  accelerate the payment of that obligation 
payment due by year beyond total thousands of dollars operating lease obligations        long term debt term     revolver    other capital lease obligations   the company s revolving line of credit converts to term debt on january   at which time quarterly payments equal to of the total outstanding become payable quarterly  but in any case must be paid in full on the revolver maturity date  which is january  phi s borrowing capacity and cash flows from operations have not historically provided sufficient capital to acquire additional aircraft needed to support the company s customers 
to meet these needs  the company has obtained aircraft under operating and capital lease arrangements  which are more expensive to the company as compared to the purchase of the aircraft  and the company had aircraft on such lease arrangements at december  the company believes that its recent improved operating performance may enable it to obtain additional financing  which would allow it to i reduce significantly its number of  and reliance on  operating leases  and ii repay outstanding amounts under the bank credit facility 
the company is currently reviewing financing alternatives including the possible issuance of debt securities or obtaining alternative commercial bank financing 
there is no assurance when or if the company would be able to obtain additional debt financing  in which case the company s ability to acquire additional aircraft will continue to be constrained by existing and future operating leases  and also by the company s current bank credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long lived assets and self insurance liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
phi estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if the company s evaluation of its significant customers and debtors creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then the company may have to recognize additional allowances in the period that it identifies the risk of loss 
phi maintains inventory to service its own aircraft and the aircraft and components of customers 
portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components and reworked to a useable condition 
the company uses systematic procedures to estimate the valuation of the used parts  which includes consideration of their condition and continuing utility 
if the company s valuation of these parts should be significantly different from amounts ultimately realizable or if it discontinues using or servicing certain aircraft models  then the company may have to record a write down of its inventory 
the company also records provisions against inventory for obsolescent and slow moving parts  relying principally on specific identification of such inventory 
if the company fails to identify such parts  additional provisions may be necessary 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company measures recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows that it expects the asset to generate 
when an asset is determined to be impaired  the company recognizes the impairment amount  which is measured by the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
similarly  the company reports assets that it expects to sell at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company must make estimates for certain of its liabilities and expenses  losses  and gains related to self insured programs  insurance deductibles  and good experience premium returns 
the company s group medical insurance program is largely self insured  and the company uses estimates to record its periodic expenses related to the program 
the company also carries deductibles on its aircraft hull and liability insurance and estimates periodic expenses related to the retained portion of hull and liability risk 
for its workers compensation and certain other insurance  the company receives a return premium if its accident experience is favorable  and the company recognizes reductions in insurance expense when it believes return premiums are likely based on accident rates and actual accident experiences 
if actual experience under any of the company s insurance programs is significantly different from estimated  then the company may have to record losses when it identifies the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if return premiums are larger than originally projected  then the company may have to record gains when it identifies the excess return premiums

on january   and it does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters the company has an aggregate estimated liability of million as of december  for environmental remediation costs that are probable and estimable 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reduced its recorded estimated liability by million as the result of a comprehensive re evaluation of environmental exposure at all of its operating sites and lowered remediation cost estimates primarily at its morgan city  louisiana facility 
the company has conducted environmental surveys of the lafayette facility which it recently vacated  and  has determined that contamination exists at that facility 
to date  borings have been installed to determine the type and extent of contamination 
preliminary results indicate limited soil and groundwater impacts 
once the extent and type of contamination are fully defined  a risk evaluation in accordance with the louisiana risk evaluation corrective action plan recap standard will be submitted and evaluated by louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq 
at that point  ldeq will establish what cleanup standards must be met at the site 
when the process is complete  the company will be in a position to develop the appropriate remediation plan and the resulting cost of remediation 
however the company has not recorded any estimated liability for remediation of contamination and  based on preliminary surveys and ongoing monitoring  the company believes the ultimate remediation costs for the lafayette facility will not be material 
to date  the company has expended million on conducting facility environmental surveys and expects to spend an additional million performing follow up work in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and makes limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage that risk 
all derivatives used for risk management are closely monitored by the company s senior management 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes and it does not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are transacted either with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges 
at december   the company was a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swaps mature in and require the company to pay an average interest rate of on the notional amount and  in turn  receive libor interest rates 
the variable interest rate received by the company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly 
the company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was a million liability at december  at december   million of the company s long term debt had variable interest rates of which million was effectively converted to fixed interest rates through the interest rate swaps 
based on debt outstanding and interest rate swap agreements in place at december   a basis point increase in variable interest rates would increase the company s interest expense in the year ending by million
