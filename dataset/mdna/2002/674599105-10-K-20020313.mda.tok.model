item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations incorporating item a business environment in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental is divided into two major operating businesses 
oil and natural gas industry the market price of west texas intermediate wti declined considerably during  falling from around bbl in january to less than bbl in december 
the fourth quarter was the weakest for oil prices since the third quarter of overall  the crude oil market continued to indicate both long term and short term price uncertainty 
nymex domestic natural gas prices were subject to greater volatility in natural gas prices  which were over thousand cubic feet mcf in the fourth quarter of  rose to mcf in the first quarter of and then declined significantly to less than mcf by year end 
increased supply from heavy investment in drilling by the industry in and  higher inventories and decreased demand combined to lower gas prices back to the level last seen in the first quarter of the number of us onshore rigs in use climbed from under in mid to over  in mid  but the decline in oil and gas prices resulted in fewer than rigs in use by the end of the year 
chemical industry the chemical industry experienced a significant decrease in demand as the decade long us economic expansion gave way to a recession in march following a slowdown that began midway through due to a pessimistic outlook and no near term signs of economic recovery  customers and distributors continued with inventory reduction and limited purchases 
most asian  european and south american countries also experienced an economic downturn similar to north american trends 
record high energy prices and feedstock costs began to drop in the second quarter  but poor product demand for the year resulted in overall weaker prices and profit margins 
domestic chlorine demand decreased significantly in  compared with  due to poor demand for chlorine derivatives including vinyls  polyurethane chemicals  epichlorohydrin and others  which are primarily used in durable goods and consumer products 
the poor chlorine demand resulted in chlorine prices declining throughout the year 
caustic soda prices peaked in the first half of the year due to major cutbacks in chlorine production 
demand was stable in the first half of the year but began to soften in the third quarter 
polyvinyl chloride pvc prices  but not margins  improved for a short time reflecting higher energy and feedstock prices during the first few months before reaching a peak in april  but weakened throughout the remainder of the year due to poor demand and increased industry capacity 
strategic overview and review of business results strategy occidental s overall strategy to add value for shareholders consists of three basic elements shift corporate assets to large  long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet harvest cash from chemicals implementation of this strategy included divesting interests in the natural gas pipeline segment and buying large legacy oil and gas assets in california and texas that are expected to provide stable production  strong earnings and cash flow and a solid platform for new growth initiatives 
at occidental  financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to produce superior returns while strengthening the balance sheet to reduce both risk and earnings volatility 
the chemicals business is being used to provide free cash flow 
specific actions oil and gas the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that  together  are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production  while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry 
continue to add commercial reserves in and around core areas in the us  middle east and latin america through a combination of focused exploration and development programs 
pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices 
maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
occidental s oil and gas business is currently concentrated in five us states and nine foreign countries 
the asset mix within each of these areas has been strengthened by the sale of properties with low or no current return and investment in assets with much higher performance potential 
the results of these changes are discussed below in business review oil gas 
chemical occidental conducts its chemical operations through occidental chemical corporation and its various subsidiaries and affiliates collectively  oxychem 
oxychem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with ethylene and chlorine  which is co produced with caustic soda  and converts them through a series of intermediate products into pvc 
in order to strengthen its position along the chlorovinyls chain  occidental entered into a major business alliance in  a vinyls partnership with geon now known as polyone named oxyvinyls  lp oxyvinyls 
corporate in july  occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a texas intrastate pipeline and its interest in a liquefied natural gas lng project in indonesia 
after tax proceeds of approximately million from these transactions were used to reduce debt 
in april  occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental petroleum ltd  renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen 
after tax proceeds  together with tax benefits from the disposition of oil producing properties in peru  totaling million were used to reduce debt following the altura acquisition 
occidental received million from chevron in a litigation settlement in november  which was used mainly to reduce high cost debt 
debt structure occidental s total debt comprises three components  as shown in the table below amounts in millions occidental other altura non public recourse recourse total date debt debt debt debt a april b     a includes trust preferred securities  natural gas delivery commitment  preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
b reflects  on a pro forma basis  the effect of billion in debt from the altura acquisition on occidental s debt as of april occidental took full advantage of its increased production profile and high oil and gas prices over an eighteen month period in and to reduce total debt 
the altura purchase increased pro forma debt to nearly billion in april by the end of  total debt had been lowered to billion  billion below the year end total in occidental s public debt at year end is more than million below the year end level and more than million below year end occidental s other recourse debt  which includes preferred stock and trust preferred securities in the above table  decreased from billion in to million in total debt capitalization ratio date total debt capitalization ratio april a a reflects  on a pro forma basis  the effect of billion in debt from the altura acquisition on occidental s public debt as of april occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately percent from the percent level that existed at the end of the debt to capitalization ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization  excluding minority interest 
business review oil and gas occidental s overall performance during the past three years reflected the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy  beginning with the billion acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california 
elk hills is one of the top ten oil and gas fields in the us and the largest source of gas in california 
the elk hills acquisition was followed in april by the purchases of altura energy in texas for billion and the much smaller thums property in long beach for million 
at the end of  these three assets made up percent of occidental s worldwide proven oil reserves and percent of its proven gas reserves 
on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis  they accounted for percent of worldwide reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day  which represents percent of occidental s total worldwide production 
altura acquisition occidental completed the acquisition of the altura properties on april  in the relatively short period since the acquisition  the altura properties have generated nearly billion in operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately million 
net production averaged  boe per day in the altura properties were successfully integrated with occidental s existing permian operations  making occidental the largest oil producer in texas 
with the altura acquisition  occidental has become a world leader in carbon dioxide co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique that involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface 
currently  occidental s co floods provide about half of its oil production in the permian basin 
milne point bravo dome swap in late  occidental swapped its percent interest in the milne point oil field in alaska operated by bp plc bp for bp s percent working interest in the bravo dome co unit in northern new mexico 
bravo dome co production averaged approximately million cubic feet per day in because of third party sales commitments  bravo dome currently meets approximately one third of occidental s co demand in the permian basin 
thums at year end  net production from the thums oil property in long beach  ca was averaging  barrels per day  an increase from approximately  barrels per day at the end of in december  work began on a d vertical seismic profile survey  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the results of this survey are expected to assist in planning for the future development of the properties 
occidental plans to build a megawatt gas fired power plant to enhance thums value 
since production at thums depends on electric submersible pumps  electricity is the single largest component of this operation s cost structure 
moreover  the supply of electricity is interruptible  meaning that when power is in short supply  service may be interrupted to accommodate other users such as domestic households 
the new power plant will allow thums to generate its own secure supply of electricity from its untapped natural gas resources  while simultaneously lowering operating costs 
any excess electricity can be sold back to the local electricity grid 
the permitting process and pre construction activities are progressing well  and construction is expected to commence in the first half of gulf of mexico in july  occidental monetized its interests on the continental shelf in the gulf of mexico gom and the proceeds were used to reduce debt 
also refer to acquisitions  dispositions and commitments for further information 
the development in the gom is currently focused on the deep water horn mountain oil discovery in which occidental has a one third interest and bp is the operator 
the discovery well  which was drilled to a depth of nearly  feet  is located about miles off the louisiana mississippi coast in  feet of water 
gross proved reserves exceed million boe with production scheduled to begin late in production is expected to peak in with occidental s peak share estimated at  boe per day 
elk hills as a result of sustained capital investment  production increased in to approximately  boe per day from approximately  boe per day in and elk hills has generated total free cash flow  after capital expenditures  of approximately billion since occidental acquired the asset in early since the date of acquisition  occidental has replaced percent of its total elk hills oil and gas production of million boe 
at the end of  the property still had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
middle east oman occidental s oman business centers on its million barrel discovery in block occidental has produced more than million gross barrels from the block  most of it from the safah field 
net production to occidental averaged  barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter  and occidental expects to expand its oman business over the next few years 
occidental uses multi lateral horizontal wells to increase production and recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed 
today  percent of occidental s production in oman relies on horizontal wells 
a new waterflood program is currently under way at safah that will enhance production and improve the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field 
yemen in yemen  occidental s net production averaged  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa 
a series of step out wells are planned for masila in that are expected to add new reserves 
in  occidental completed a d seismic program in block preliminary analysis of these data was completed  and plans are under way to begin drilling two exploratory wells in block in late in addition  a d seismic program is beginning in the first quarter of in block analysis of seismic data for block  which is part of the under explored southern portion of the rub al khali desert  has been completed and a test well began drilling in january qatar in qatar  occidental successfully reversed years of declining production in the idd el shargi north dome field 
by introducing advanced drilling systems and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques  gross production increased from  barrels per day to more than  barrels per day  peaking at  barrels in occidental is developing the south dome field as a satellite to the north dome  which reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects 
combined production from the two fields in the fourth quarter of was  barrels per day  net to occidental 
occidental also has implemented a waterflood program in the north dome s shuaiba reservoir and is currently evaluating a second generation redevelopment project 
occidental is also pursuing new exploration opportunities in qatar 
saudi arabia in saudi arabia  occidental has a percent interest in the core venture two consortium  which expects to invest in the red sea area to help the kingdom identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market 
the red sea venture currently consists of development of discovered gas from the midyan and barqan fields in the northwest part of the kingdom  and construction of related gas processing and pipeline facilities 
the consortium expects to build at least one power plant and possibly a water desalination unit and will also evaluate the potential for a petrochemical plant 
the project also calls for onshore and offshore exploration in blocks to located in and along the red sea 
exploration success in these blocks will lay the foundation for additional investment opportunities in power generation  water desalination and petrochemicals in the western part of the kingdom 
an initial agreement was signed with the kingdom on june  final agreements are currently expected to be signed in other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas interests in the badin blocks in pakistan  which bp operates 
current gross production is  boe per day 
occidental s net share is approximately  boe per day 
current plans call for drilling to wells per year to develop new and existing fields by the end of  and occidental continues to evaluate additional exploration opportunities 
russia in russia  occidental s percent joint venture company  vanyoganneft  produced approximately  boe  net to occidental  in the fourth quarter of indonesia in july  occidental sold its interest in the tangguh lng project in indonesia  which was in its initial phase of development  to mitsubishi corporation of japan for a sale price of million 
the proceeds were used in occidental s debt reduction program 
latin america colombia in  production from occidental s cano limon operations in colombia was substantially reduced from and levels due to a record number of attacks by local left wing terrorist groups on the pipeline  which is operated by ecopetrol 
nevertheless  occidental s net share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day and this operation continues to be profitable 
this operation accounts for less than one percent of occidental s worldwide assets and only three percent of total worldwide reserves and four percent of worldwide oil and gas production at year end occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract 
the potential rewards are significant when the pipeline is fully operational 
the gibraltar exploration well  which was drilled approximately miles west of cano limon  did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  and the million cost of the well was written off in ecuador in  occidental farmed out a percent economic interest in block in ecuador to alberta energy company ltd 
aec 
this transaction reduced occidental s exposure in ecuador and is expected to largely fund its capital program in country through gross production in block is currently flat with average production of approximately  barrels of oil per day  with  barrels net to occidental 
occidental has begun development of the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block the start up of production is scheduled to coincide with the completion of the oleoducto de crudos pesados ocp ltd 
heavy oil pipeline in in addition  work is being carried out in the western portion of the block in and around fields currently in production 
the combined effect of these projects is expected to add net incremental production of  barrels per day to occidental s production profile 
in addition  occidental is expanding its exploration activities in block with an aggressive d seismic program 
foreign oil companies  including occidental  have been paying value added tax vat  generally calculated on the basis of percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export 
until  these vat payments were reimbursed to the oil companies because they are incurred for the production of an export product 
in  the ecuador tax authority announced that these vat payments do not qualify for reimbursement 
in response  the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement 
occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable ecuador tax law and historic precedent 
business review chemical although industry volumes improved in early following weak second half demand  pvc resin sales in north america lagged levels by percent through june overall demand declined percent from to significant oversupply of pvc resin combined with continued inventory reductions by customers resulted in north american pvc industry operating rates of around percent in  versus percent in pvc resin prices increased only slightly in the first half of  but declined throughout the remainder of the year 
higher exports in prevented operating rates from falling lower  but export sales returned only minimal margins 
on june   oxychem temporarily idled its ingleside  tx ethylene dichloride edc plant and on december   oxychem temporarily idled the deer park chlor alkali plant in houston  tx due to a combination of deteriorating prices and weak demand 
these facilities will remain idle until economic conditions improve 
in occidental s chlor alkali business  reduced demand for chlorine led to significantly reduced operating rates 
oxychem s operating rate  as a percent of capacity  fell from percent in to percent in the chlorine industry s operating rate was percent compared to percent for despite reduced liquid caustic production  caustic prices declined in the second half of the year on weak demand 
as progressed  chlorine prices fell due to declining demand  especially in the global vinyls market 
operations at the convent chlor alkali and edc plant  which had been curtailed  were recommenced in record high energy costs in the first quarter of adversely affected earnings 
for the total year  energy costs were higher than  but well below first quarter levels 
feedstock costs followed the same trend as energy costs 
petrochemical margins were under pressure throughout due to weak demand and significant capacity additions by basf atofina  formosa plastics and union carbide nova chemical 
lower feedstock costs in the fourth quarter were offset by lower prices due to continued weak demand 
the primary goal of occidental s chemical business is to provide free cash flow 
from through  total cash flow from the chemicals business was billion  including asset sales  net of acquisitions  of billion 
outlook oil and gas the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
in the fourth quarter of  worldwide oil prices weakened considerably and have remained lower than their ten year averages in the first quarter of sustained low prices will significantly impact profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles 
while fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting crude oil prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  which make it difficult to accurately predict oil and natural gas prices 
in the short term  other factors such as weather patterns do have a significant effect  particularly on natural gas prices 
in the united states  increased gas supplies from large capital investment over the past year  combined with a later winter  resulted in inventory levels at the end of exceeding the average of the preceding five years by percent 
the combination of higher gas supplies and lower demand  which is continuing into the first quarter of  is expected to result in significantly lower average gas price realizations for occidental in than in chemical the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast  but this business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when demand is strong 
industry operating rates in the chlor alkali vinyls business are expected to recover gradually in chlor alkali domestic chlorine demand is expected to increase by nearly percent in  which should allow the industry s operating rates to improve in the absence of capacity additions 
liquid caustic pricing is expected to continue to be weak 
the domestic chlorine market price is expected to improve gradually throughout as the vinyls demand for chlorine increases 
liquid caustic pricing peaked in the second quarter of and is expected to decline through the second quarter of in late  oxychem temporarily idled its deer park  tx chlor alkali facility until economic conditions improve 
vinyls while the beginning of a weak recovery is expected in the second half of  continued supply demand imbalances in pvc markets will likely prevent all but seasonal product price increases 
continued pressure on raw materials  particularly ethylene  should result in relatively stable  albeit low  price spreads over raw materials 
overall  north american pvc growth is expected to average only percent in  reflecting weak consumer confidence and low gdp growth 
while pvc will continue to make inroads into new markets  the high volume construction and automotive end markets for pvc products will likely remain well below peak demand levels 
north american pvc industry operating rates are expected to average between percent for the year 
petrochemicals equistar partnership in january  occidental and lyondell chemical company lyondell agreed  in principle  for occidental to sell its share of equistar to lyondell and to purchase an equity interest of approximately percent in lyondell 
these transactions are subject to the execution of definitive documents and corporate and regulatory approvals 
in connection with the agreement in principle  occidental wrote down its investment in the equistar partnership by million  after tax  in december occidental will continue to reflect its share of equistar s results until the transaction closes  which is expected in the second quarter of income summary occidental reported net income of billion per share in  on net sales of billion  compared with net income of billion per share in  on net sales of billion

occidental explores for and produces oil and natural gas  domestically and internationally 
occidental seeks long term growth and improvement in profitability and cash flow through a combination of increased operating efficiencies in core assets  enhanced oil recovery projects  focused exploration opportunities and complementary property acquisitions 
earnings before special items in were billion compared with billion in the increase in earnings before special items reflected primarily the impact of higher natural gas prices and higher production volumes  partially offset by lower worldwide crude oil prices and higher exploration expense 
approximately percent of oil and gas sales revenues for were attributable to oil and gas trading activity  compared with approximately percent in and percent in these trading activities focus on obtaining the highest sale price available 
occidental also occasionally engages in hedging activities for relatively small parts of its total production to reduce exposure to price risk  thereby mitigating cash flow volatility 
refer to derivative and hedging activities for a complete discussion 
other than the positive effect on oil and gas realized prices  the results of trading activities are not significant 
the increase in oil and gas trading revenues from to was due to a percent increase in the volume of oil and gas trades and a percent increase in gas prices 
the revenue was also positively affected by an increase in the volume of natural gas liquids ngls  although this impact was not significant 
these positive effects were partially offset by an percent decrease in oil prices associated with the trading contracts

the amount reflected lower capital expenditures and also reflected net cash used of million in connection with the formation of oxyvinyls 
capital expenditures in millions oil and gas  chemical corporate and other total  oil and gas capital expenditures were significantly higher in reflecting higher oil field service costs and higher development spending resulting  primarily  from a larger asset base 
amounts from all three years exclude any significant acquisitions 
occidental s capital spending budget for is billion 
of the total  approximately billion will be allocated to oil and gas  with qatar  elk hills and the permian basin receiving the highest priority 
financing activities in millions net cash used provided   the amount reflected the repayment of billion of long term and non recourse debt  partially offset by proceeds of million from new long term debt

occidental paid common stock dividends of million in and million in and paid preferred and common stock dividends of million in in  a total of  shares of cxy indexed convertible preferred stock were converted by the holders into  shares of occidental s common stock 
at the end of  and  occidental had no preferred stock outstanding 
however  most of the trust preferred securities issued in january by oxy capital trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary of occidental  remain outstanding at december  occidental has a centralized cash management system that funds the working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its various subsidiaries 
there are no provisions under existing debt agreements that significantly restrict the ability to move funds among operating entities 
additional considerations regarding funding and liquidity in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and  unless otherwise noted  are not recorded on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
chemical transactions taft cogeneration facility occidental has undertaken certain commitments in connection with the construction and leasing of a cogeneration facility in taft  la 
this facility will supply all the steam and electric power requirements for occidental s taft chlor alkali plant for less cost than if the plant were to generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility 
an owner trust with investors as participating beneficiaries owns the project  with occidental acting as general contractor during construction

analysis of financial position the changes in the following components of occidental s balance sheet are discussed below selected balance sheet components in millions trade receivables  net receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other long term receivables  net   equity investments  property  plant and equipment  net   current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities accounts payable  accrued liabilities  current obligation under natural gas delivery commitment long term debt  net   altura non recourse debt  long term obligation under natural gas delivery commitment other deferred credits and liabilities   minority interest   trust preferred securities stockholders equity   the lower balance in trade receivables at december   compared with december   reflected lower product prices during the fourth quarter of versus the decrease in receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other was due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments in the oil and gas trading group 
the lower balance in equity investments primarily reflected the write down of the equity investment in equistar in december the decrease in the net balance in property  plant and equipment reflected depreciation  depletion and amortization and the sale of the entity that owns pipelines in texas  offset in part by capital spending 
the decrease in current maturities of long term debt reflected a reclassification of the current portion of long term debt  since it is management s intention to refinance the amount on a long term basis by issuing long term debt 
the decrease in accounts payable was due to lower trade payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments in the oil and gas trading group  a lower accrual for interest expense and other miscellaneous items

other deferred credits and liabilities included deferred compensation  primarily other post retirement benefits  environmental reserves  contract advances  deferred revenue and other deferred items 
the decrease in this account was primarily the result of the decrease in deferred revenue from the gom monetization 
the increase in stockholders equity primarily reflected net income  partially offset by dividends on common stock

derivative and hedging activities general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices  and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
occidental s results are sensitive mainly to crude oil and natural gas prices and fluctuations in those prices have an impact on occidental s results 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  they would have approximately a million annual affect  before us income tax 
if natural gas prices vary by per million btu mmbtu  they would have approximately a million annual effect  before us income tax 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental may periodically use different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas  to reduce its exposure to price volatility and thus mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
usually occidental remains unhedged to long term oil and gas prices 
overall  occidental s use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a relatively low level 
however  current rules require extensive disclosure regarding any level of derivative use 
the following disclosures describe each area of occidental s derivative activity in detail 
effective january   occidental adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for certain energy trading contracts 
eitf requires that energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings and separately disclosed in the financial statements or accompanying footnotes 
the initial adoption of eitf resulted in a first quarter non cash after tax benefit of million  recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in effective january   occidental adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively sfas no 
 as amended 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and require an entity to recognize all derivatives in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value unless the instrument qualifies as a normal purchase or sale contract 
changes in the derivative instrument s fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that meet specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are reported in other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses on cash flow hedge transactions that are reported in oci are reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
gains and losses from derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in earnings along with the change in fair value of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 gains and losses on commodity futures contracts that qualified for hedge accounting  essentially those associated with equity production or purchases  were deferred until recognized as an adjustment to sales revenue or purchase costs when the related transaction being hedged was finalized 
occidental s initial adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  resulted in a first quarter after tax reduction in net income of million recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles and an after tax reduction in oci of approximately million 
the adoption also increased total assets by million and total liabilities by million as of january  commodity price derivatives general with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental used a combination of futures  options and swaps to offset various open price positions 
the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes or synthetic price curves established from quoted prices adjusted for time  location and quality differentials 
cash flow commodity hedges occidental used cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas in  with the objective of mitigating price risk arising from fluctuating values for these commodities 
crude oil hedges were executed for occidental s west texas production 
its strategy to achieve these objectives included a combination of purchased put options and written call options resulting in no net premium received for crude oil hedging 
purchased put options were used for natural gas hedging and were executed for the mid continent production area to establish a minimum sales price for its production 
occidental used no fair value hedges for crude oil or natural gas production during occidental s cash flow hedging instruments  which consist of natural gas put option contracts  are highly effective 
during  net gains of million were recorded to oci relating to changes in current cash flow hedges and net losses of million were reclassified from oci into earnings as a reduction to net sales revenue  as the forecasted transactions actually occurred 
the fair value at december  of derivative financial instruments that have been designated and have qualified as cash flow hedging instruments was million 
the gain was recorded as an increase to oci and will be reclassified into earnings during when the forecasted transactions actually occur 
marketing and trading operations the fair value at december  of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations is a net gain of million 
gains of million were recorded in earnings due to the change in fair value of these financial derivative instruments during offsetting the value of these instruments are related physical positions with a fair value of million loss at december  gains of million were recorded in earnings due to the change in the fair value of related physical positions during the net positions mostly expire in additionally  a long term sales contract volume commitment is  mmbtu per day through october the approximate million net gain from the change in fair value during of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations was reflected in the income statement 
the million net gain represents a reversal of negative mark to market adjustments resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended 
at december   total assets and liabilities include million and million for the fair value of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations 
prior to the physical settlement of any energy contract held for trading purposes  favorable or unfavorable price movement is reported in the income statement 
an offsetting amount is recorded on the balance sheet as unrealized gains or unrealized losses on trading transactions 
when a contract to sell energy is physically settled  the above entries are reversed and the gross amount invoiced to the customer is included as net sales in the income statement 
similarly  when a contract to purchase energy is physically settled  the purchase price is included as cost of sales in the income statement 
until a contract is physically settled  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified to a receivable or payable account 
other than the positive effect on oil and gas realized prices  the results of trading activities are not significant 
reconciliation of fair value of contracts from january  to december  in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at january  contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period gains losses changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at december  maturity periods total source of and fair fair value to to thereafter value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total gas presale in november  occidental entered into a natural gas delivery commitment for proceeds of million  which obligates occidental to deliver billion cubic feet of natural gas over a four year period ending in december this transaction resulted in less expensive financing and enables occidental to satisfy the delivery commitment at a fixed price with open market purchases without reducing its own natural gas reserves 
the imputed interest rate in the transaction is approximately percent 
the current portion of occidental s natural gas delivery commitment million at december  is shown as a current liability on occidental s consolidated balance sheets 
the present value of the non current commitment million at december  is shown under deferred credits and other liabilities on occidental s consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with this transaction  occidental simultaneously entered into a natural gas price swap based on identical volumes of natural gas and a delivery schedule that corresponds to the natural gas delivery commitment 
under the terms of the swap  occidental will pay an average fixed price of per mmbtu of gas and will receive a floating price that will approximate market  which essentially eliminates occidental s exposure to commodity price fluctuations that could affect this transaction 
at december   the fair value of this price swap is an million gain  which is offset by an million loss applicable to the related physical positions 
activities prior to sfas implementation at december   occidental was a party to commodity exchange and over the counter forward obligations 
the instruments held for purposes other than trading expire during the period from january to december  and relate to the hedging of natural gas and crude oil prices 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was million 
offsetting the value of these instruments were related physical positions with a million loss 
the principal components of these instruments and related physical positions are the related natural gas price swap and the natural gas delivery commitment  which is discussed above 
at december   the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of these obligations was an unrealized loss of approximately million 
the instruments held or issued for trading purposes mostly expired in  with the exception of a long term sales contract that expires in the fair value of these instruments at december  was million 
offsetting the value of these instruments were related physical positions with a million loss 
the net gain of approximately million was reflected in the income statement 
the majority of the gain was from the mark to market adjustment under eitf issue no 
of a long term sales contract 
interest rate derivatives fair value hedges interest rate swaps  forward locks and futures contracts are entered into as part of occidental s overall strategy to manage interest rate exposure 
during  occidental entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting 
these derivatives effectively convert approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from to in and  occidental also had interest rate swaps converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt that matured in november net interest expense was impacted by million of income in  million of expense in and income of almost million in to reflect the effects of the fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges occidental is a party to a series of forward interest rate locks  which qualified as a cash flow hedge  that are required to be settled on or prior to december  these financial instruments relate to debt raised by a third party to construct a cogeneration plant that will be subject to a long term operating lease to oxychem 
as the lease payments will be directly related to the amount of interest paid on the underlying debt  the forward rate locks were put in place to hedge the future lease payments 
the lease payments are expected to commence on or before january  the fair value of these financial instruments at december  was an unrealized loss of million  that would be offset by potentially lower lease payments due to the lower interest rate environment 
occidental and its equity investees have also entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges 
the amounts related to these hedges are included below 
for the year ended  a million gain was reclassified from oci to income due to the expiration of cash flow hedges and a million loss was recorded to oci relating to changes in current cash flow hedges 
during the next twelve months  occidental expects that less than about million of net derivative losses included in oci  based on their valuation at december   will be reclassified into earnings 
hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the year 
foreign currency derivatives many of occidental s foreign oil and gas operations and foreign chemical operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar on a continuing basis 
generally  an effective currency forward market does not exist for these countries 
therefore  occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency since the cash flows are mainly denominated in us dollars 
however  in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency  occidental has exposure on debt that is denominated in us dollars that is not material 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 
credit risk occidental s derivative contracts are spread among numerous banks and market leaders in the industry 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an on going basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counter party exposure relative to credit limits  and manages credit enhancement requirements such as collateral  parental guarantees and letters of credit 
credit limits for all customers whether financial or physical are established and entered into occidental s risk management systems  and these limits are monitored for compliance on an aggregated basis across all traded commodities 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
the credit determination process takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the counter party  the counter party s parent  parental guarantees  letters of credit  and other credit enhancing instruments 
taxes deferred tax liabilities were million at december   net of deferred tax assets of million 
the current portion of the deferred tax assets of million is included in prepaid expenses and other 
the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and proceedings 
they have also been named as potentially responsible parties prps in governmental proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and corresponding state acts 
these governmental proceedings seek funding  remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  aggregating substantial amounts 
occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings  and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred in those proceedings where it is probable that occidental will incur remediation costs which can be reasonably estimated 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that occidental and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
several of these matters may involve substantial amounts  and if these were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably to the full amount of their maximum potential exposure  an event not currently anticipated  it is possible that such event could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  in management s opinion  after taking into account reserves  it is unlikely that any of the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and may continue to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process 
these expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to previous waste disposal practices 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or ownership or control of sites 
occidental is currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal cercla sites  comparable state sites and other remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named as defendants and or as prps under the federal cercla law 
these proceedings seek funding and or remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged personal injury or property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  aggregating substantial amounts 
occidental does not consider the number of cercla and similar state sites at which it has been notified that it has been identified as being involved to be a relevant measure of exposure 
although the liability of a prp may be joint and several  occidental is usually one of many companies cited as a prp at these sites and has  to date  been successful in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies 
also  many of these sites are still under investigation by the environmental protection agency epa or the equivalent state agencies 
before actual cleanup  the parties involved assess site conditions and responsibility and determine the appropriate remedy 
the majority of remediation costs are incurred after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval to proceed 
the ultimate future cost of remediation of certain of the sites for which occidental has been notified that it has been identified as being involved cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
as of december   occidental had been notified by the epa or equivalent state agencies  or otherwise had become aware  that it had been identified as being involved at cercla or comparable state sites 
this number does not include those sites where occidental has been successful in resolving its involvement 
the sites include former diamond shamrock chemical sites as to which maxus energy corporation has retained all liability 
of the remaining sites  occidental has denied involvement at sites and has yet to determine involvement in sites 
with respect to the remaining of these sites  occidental is in various stages of evaluation  and the extent of liability retained by maxus energy corporation is disputed at of these sites 
for of these sites  where environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated  occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred 
the sites include sites as to which present information indicates that it is probable that occidental s aggregate exposure is insignificant 
in determining the reserves  occidental uses the most current information available  including similar past experiences  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
for the remaining of the sites being evaluated  occidental does not have sufficient information to determine a range of liability  but occidental does have sufficient information on which to base the opinion expressed above in the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for management s opinion on lawsuits and proceedings and on other environmental loss contingencies  see the above noted section 
environmental costs occidental s environmental costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate environmental reserves corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to long lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc gsh 
gsh has full management authority over all remediation sites and reports directly to occidental s corporate management 
the environmental reserves  as shown in the table above  have been provided for environmental remediation liabilities at the superfund and comparable state sites discussed above  and for resource conservation and recovery act and other sites where occidental has environmental remediation responsibility 
eight counties in the houston galveston area are subject to a federal epa mandate to adopt a plan for implementing certain requirements of the federal clean air act  known as a state implementation plan 
in october  the epa approved a state implementation plan for the houston galveston area the plan 
the plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of percent of current nitrogen oxide nox emissions in the houston galveston area by november occidental operates five facilities that will be subject to the plan s nox reduction requirements 
occidental estimates that its capital expenditures will increase by between million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the plan s enacted or proposed nox reduction requirements 
occidental began expending the capital necessary to comply with the plan in and expects expenditures to end in  although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility 
occidental presently estimates that divisional capital expenditures for environmental compliance including the sip discussed above will be in the range of million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion was located in the middle east  approximately million was located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder were located in pakistan and russia 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles require the use of management judgments and estimates in addition to the rules and regulations established by accounting pronouncements 
occidental has adopted a number of accounting policies  the most important of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
occidental believes the most critical accounting policy  including judgments in its application  that may have an impact on occidental s financial statements relates to the accounting for capitalized  long term assets 
the rates at which these assets are depreciated or otherwise written off are subject to a number of judgments about future events  many of which are beyond management s control 
oil and gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring proved and unproved properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
annual lease rentals and exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs and exploratory dry hole costs  are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined principally by the unit of production method and is based on estimated recoverable reserves 
these reserves are subject to revision based upon actual performance as well as changes in the price of oil and gas 
significantly higher or lower product prices will lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits or the effects of production sharing contracts 
the process of estimation of reserves is inherently judgmental  especially during the early life of a field 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
thus  occidental s depreciation and depletion expense could change in the future 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately billion  as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these costs are not subject to depreciation or depletion on a current basis 
as development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized cost of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized cost of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the rate at which these unproven properties are written off  therefore  depends upon future exploration and development activities as well as the product price environment 
occidental believes its development and exploration efforts will result in the addition of sufficient reserves to fully realize this investment in unproved properties 
chemical facilities are depreciated using either the unit of production method or straight line method  both based upon the estimated productive life of the facilities 
occidental makes annual capital renewal expenditures for its chemical plants on a continual basis while the plants are in operation 
impairment reserves are provided when a decision is made to dispose of a property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis 
judgments about the useful life of a chemical plant can change depending on a number of factors  such as sustained higher or lower energy prices  environmental regulations  foreign competition and technological change 
thus  occidental s depreciation expense could be higher or lower depending on these and other factors 
additional accounting changes listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to occidental
