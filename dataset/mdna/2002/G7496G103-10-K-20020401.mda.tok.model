item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the years ended december   and for the year ended december  the following also includes a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this filing 
this filing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results described or implied by these forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview founded in  renaissancere is one of the leading providers of property catastrophe reinsurance coverage in the world 
we believe that we are a provider of first choice for many insurers and reinsurers due to our modeling and technical expertise and our industry leading performance 
we principally provide property catastrophe reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers  with exposures worldwide  on an excess of loss basis 
property catastrophe reinsurance generally provides protection from claims arising from large catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  winter storms  freezes  floods  tornadoes  fires  explosions and other man made or natural disasters 
accordingly  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  and the coverage offered to clients impacted by these events 
we are a leader in utilizing sophisticated computer models to construct a superior portfolio of these property catastrophe coverages 
we believe that a combination of several factors our disciplined underwriting approach  the experience of our underwriters  as well as our sophisticated risk models have enabled us to significantly outperform the majority of our competitors 
this was especially evident during when we achieved an operating return on equity even though industry insurance losses were at an all time high 
for the years ended december  and december   our gross premiums written were million and million  respectively  our net premiums written were million and million  respectively  our operating income available to common shareholders  which excludes realised gains and losses on investments  was million or per common share and million or per common share  respectively  and our net income available to common shareholders was million or per common share and million or per common share  respectively 
at december   we had total assets of billion and total shareholders equity of billion 
at december   total shareholders equity attributable to common shareholders was billion and our book value per common share was  compared with million and per share at december  our principal subsidiary is renaissance reinsurance  a bermuda domiciled company 
in  renaissance reinsurance wrote million of gross written premiums  compared to million in of these premiums  million were derived from property catastrophe reinsurance coverage  compared to million in in recent years  we have formed certain joint ventures whereby we write property catastrophe reinsurance for the joint ventures in return for management fees and a profit participation 
o in january  we formed top layer re with state farm to provide high layer coverage for non us risks 
renaissance reinsurance and state farm each own of top layer re 
o in october  we formed davinci reinsurance ltd 
with state farm and other private investors 
davinci writes property catastrophe reinsurance side by side with renaissance reinsurance and is consolidated in our financial statements 
o in  we were also appointed underwriting managers of op cat  a wholly owned subsidiary of overseas partners limited overseas partners 
opcat  like davinci  was formed to write property catastrophe reinsurance side by side with renaissance reinsurance 
in february  overseas partners decided to exit the reinsurance business 
in conjunction with this decision  renaissance reinsurance has agreed to assume op cat s business 
in november  renaissancere incorporated renaissance underwriting managers to act as underwriting manager to these joint ventures 
together  these joint ventures wrote million of premium in  compared to million in in total  top layer re and davinci had access to approximately billion of capital as of december  we believe that our position as a leading property catastrophe reinsurance underwriter is reflected by the continued growth in the property catastrophe premiums written by renaissance reinsurance and these joint ventures which  when combined  we refer to as managed catastrophe premiums 
the total managed catastrophe premiums written on behalf of renaissance reinsurance and the joint ventures increased to million on a gross basis for the year ended december  million  including million written on behalf of our joint ventures million 
subsequent to the world trade center tragedy  demand and prices of property catastrophe reinsurance have increased and we currently expect total managed catastrophe premiums to grow substantially in in addition to catastrophe reinsurance  we also write certain other lines of reinsurance through renaissance reinsurance including aviation  finite  satellite and catastrophe exposed workers compensation coverages 
we refer to this business as our specialty reinsurance business 
in  we wrote gross written premiums of million of specialty reinsurance  compared with million written in we also write primary insurance through our four subsidiaries glencoe insurance ltd  desoto insurance company  desoto prime insurance company and stonington insurance company  formerly known as nobel insurance company 
glencoe  the largest of these subsidiaries  primarily provides catastrophe exposed primary property coverage on an excess and surplus lines basis 
during  glencoe s gross written premiums were million  compared to million in desoto and desoto prime are active in the florida homeowners market 
during  desoto and desoto prime wrote million of primary homeowners insurance coverage  compared to million in stonington  a texas domiciled insurance company  is licensed to operate in all states of the us because we focus on writing reinsurance and insurance which provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverage we offer to clients impacted by these events 
in addition to the reinsurance and insurance coverages discussed above  from time to time  we may consider opportunistic diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth or the acquisition of other companies or books of business 
in evaluating such new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core reinsurance operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the claims and claim expense reserves 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  it is possible that our individual case reserves for each catastrophic event are incorrect  possibly materially 
the period of time from the reporting of a loss to us through the settlement of our liability may be several years 
during this period  additional facts and trends will be revealed and as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted 
therefore  changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant  or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
the impact on net income from changes in prior years loss reserves was an increase of million during  a decrease of million during and an increase of million in to reduce the potential impact from prior period reserve adjustments  we estimate our claims and claim expense reserves based on claims reports from insureds  our underwriters experience in setting claims reserves  the use of computer models where applicable and historical industry claims experience 
where necessary we will also use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
we review our reserves on a regular basis 
other material judgments made by us are the estimates of potential impairments in asset valuations  particularly potential uncollectable reinsurance recoverables  and impairments in our deferred tax asset 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables which might be uncollectable  our senior managers evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers  on a reinsurer by reinsurer basis  both before purchasing the reinsurance protection from them and after the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event 
we believe that our process is effective  and to date we have not written off any significant reinsurance recoveries 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million relating to reinsurance recoverables  based on specific facts and circumstances evaluated by management 
in estimating impairments to our deferred tax asset  we analyze the businesses which generated the deferred tax asset  and the businesses that will potentially utilize the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax asset relates primarily to net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxes payable of our us operating subsidiaries 
however  due to the limited opportunities in the us primary insurance market  the us insurance operations have not generated taxable income in the last few years 
this calls into question the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
although we retain the benefit of this asset through  during and we recorded valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
as of december   the net balance of the deferred tax asset was million 
summary of results of operations for and a summary of the significant components of our revenues and expenses are as follows year ended december  in thousands net underwriting income reinsurance    net underwriting income loss primary   other income    investment income    interest and fixed charges    corporate expenses    taxes    other  net operating income available to common shareholders    net realized gains losses    net income    net income per common share net underwriting income consists of net premiums earned less claims and claim expenses incurred  acquisition costs and operational expenses 
net operating income excludes realised gains and losses on investments 
the million increase in operating income in  compared to  was primarily the result of the following items o a million increase in underwriting income from our reinsurance operations due primarily to an increase in net premiums earned of million  in part offset by a million increase in claims  plus o an increase in fee income from our joint ventures of million  primarily as a result of fees earned in on premiums written on behalf of our joint ventures in  plus o a reduction in interest and fixed charges of million resulting primarily from the repayment of million of outstanding bank loans in the fourth quarter of  less o an increase in tax expense during as a result of a million increase to our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset as a result of further reductions of our us based insurance operations after this adjustment the net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet is million  less o an increase in corporate expenses of million primarily due to costs related to research and development initiatives conducted by us in  less o a decrease in investment income of million primarily as a result of declining interest rates 
the million increase in operating income in  compared to  was primarily the result of the following items o a million increase in investment income primarily due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in the level of assets held during the majority of  plus o an increase in fee income from our joint ventures of million as a result of an increase in premiums written on behalf of our joint ventures to million in compared with million in  less o an increase of million in interest expense as a result of an increase in outstanding bank loans during the majority of  less o a million increase in tax expense during the year  primarily as a result of an million increase to our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  as a result of a decrease in our us based insurance operations 
results of operations for and the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december   compared to each of the years ended december   and  and a discussion of our financial condition at december  premiums gross written premiums year ended december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance    specialty reinsurance    total reinsurance    insurance premiums glencoe    insurance premiums other    total insurance premiums    total gross written premiums    the increase in our property catastrophe premiums over the past two years is primarily due to an improving market following the worldwide level of losses occurring in during  insured losses from natural catastrophes and man made disasters are estimated to be over billion which  before the world trade center disaster in  was the second highest claims total ever for insurers 
during  nine significant worldwide catastrophic events occurred the hail storms in sydney  australia in april  the oklahoma tornados in may  hurricane floyd which struck in september  typhoon bart which struck japan in september  turkish and taiwanese earthquakes in august and september  respectively  and the danish windstorm  anatol  and the french windstorms  lothar and martin  in december 
six of these events each resulted in over billion of insured damages 
because of these events  as with many large losses  two things occurred many reinsurers recorded significant losses and were forced to  or chose to  withdraw their underwriting capacity from these regions  and these losses raised the awareness of the severity of the losses which could impact these geographic locations 
as a result of these factors  prices for reinsurance coverages in these and other geographic locations increased  in some cases significantly 
accordingly  our reinsurance premiums also increased  first from the increased prices on renewing policies and secondly by enabling us to write new business which was previously priced at an uneconomical rate of return 
our property catastrophe premiums also increased as a result of reinstatement premiums we received relating to these large losses 
per contractual terms  we record reinstatement premiums after an insured notifies us of a claim 
reinstatement premiums allow an insured to purchase  or reinstate  the limit of their reinsurance policy for the remainder of the policy period 
because of the increased level of claims from the events  and more recently from the world trade center disaster  our reinstatement and adjustment premiums for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
because of improving market conditions  we have increased our premiums in the specialty reinsurance market  which we define as reinsurance coverages that are not specifically property catastrophe coverages 
in evaluating specialty reinsurance opportunities  we focus on those coverages which  like property catastrophe reinsurance  produce losses that are infrequent in nature  but could be severe if they occur 
examples include aviation  satellite  finite and catastrophe exposed workers compensation coverages 
over the past couple of years  we have reduced the amount of insurance premiums written by our other primary insurance companies because of the limited profitable opportunities in the us primary insurance markets 
during  stonington accounted for the majority of the premiums written  million  the substantial majority of which was reinsured 
ceded reinsurance premiums ceded premiums year ended december  in thousands reinsurance    primary    total    because of the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance business  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses 
we utilize our rems c modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase 
during and  we increased our purchases of reinsurance because we received a number of new opportunities to purchase reinsurance at economical rates of return 
although we would remain liable to the extent that any of our reinsurers fails to pay our claims  before placing reinsurance we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers 
we believe that our process is effective and  to date  we have not written off any significant reinsurance recoveries 
as of december   the majority of the million of losses recoverable relates to outstanding claims reserves on our books  and accordingly they cannot be collected by us until we first pay our losses 
we expect to fully collect on all of this recorded reinsurance balance recoverable 
also  we have recently begun buying quota share protection of our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
these policies are similar to our joint venture activities  where we receive an override and a profit commission on these cessions 
approximately of the limits under our reinsurance coverage have been purchased on a multi year basis  which will result in relatively stable costs on those policies for fiscal years and to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the potential volatility of our results 
gross premiums written by geographic region year ended december  in thousands united states and caribbean    worldwide    worldwide excluding us    europe    other    australia and new zealand    specialty reinsurance    total reinsurance    united states primary    total gross premiums written    the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category specialty reinsurance includes coverages related to non catastrophe reinsurance risks assumed by us 
these coverages primarily include exposure to claims from accident and health  aviation  finite and satellite risks assumed by us 
underwriting results the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its loss ratio  expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the loss ratio is the result of dividing claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is the result of dividing underwriting expenses acquisition and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the table below sets forth our net premiums earned  claims and claim expenses and underwriting expenses by segment and their corresponding loss  expense and combined ratios year ended december  in thousands reinsurance net earned premiums property catastrophe    reinsurance net earned premiums specialty reinsurance    total reinsurance net earned premiums    primary net earned premiums    total net earned premiums    reinsurance claims and claim expenses    primary claims and claim expenses    total claims and claim expenses    reinsurance underwriting expenses    primary underwriting expenses    total underwriting expenses    reinsurance net underwriting profit    primary net underwriting profit loss    net underwriting profit total    reinsurance claims and claim expense ratio primary claims and claim expense ratio total claims and claim expense ratio reinsurance expense ratio primary expense ratio total expense ratio reinsurance combined ratio primary combined ratio total combined ratio our claims and claim expenses  claims and claim expenses ratio  and our combined ratio for the reinsurance operations have increased primarily as a result of an increase in our specialty reinsurance premiums  which normally will produce a higher claims and claim expense and combined ratio than our principal product  property catastrophe reinsurance 
our claims and claim expenses for also increased as a result of our claims and claim expenses from the world trade center tragedy 
although industry wide insurance losses were the highest in history during and were the third highest in history in  we recorded increases in net income  cash flows from operations  earnings per share and book value per share 
we attribute this outstanding performance to our disciplined underwriting approach  the experience of our underwriters  as well as our sophisticated risk models 
in the normal course of business  we also purchase reinsurance protection see discussion of ceded reinsurance premiums above 
our underwriting results benefited from our purchase of reinsurance protection as we recorded reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
although there can be no assurance that our underwriting results will continue to benefit from the purchase of reinsurance  we will continue to purchase reinsurance protection to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available 
our underwriting expenses consist of operational expenses and acquisition costs 
operational expenses consist of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
acquisition costs consist of costs to acquire premiums and are principally made up of broker commissions and excise taxes 
our reinsurance business operates with a limited number of employees and we are able to grow our book of business without substantially increasing our operating costs 
acquisition costs are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
therefore  as our premiums increase  we expect that our operating costs will tend to remain relatively stable 
since our acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premiums written  these costs will fluctuate in line with the fluctuation in premiums 
therefore  in total  as our premiums increase  we would expect that our expense ratio would decrease  as was the case in other factors may also affect the expense ratios  including business mix  the receipt of ceding commissions or similar payments that may offset expenses 
acquisition costs and operational expenses for the year ended december  were million  or  compared to million  or of net premiums earned for the year ended december  as discussed above  the primary reason for the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio was the increase in net premiums earned and the limited growth in the operational expenses of our reinsurance business 
acquisition costs and operational expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned  compared to million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  the primary contributor to the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was the increase in gross premiums earned by renaissance reinsurance with respect to noncatastrophe reinsurance products  which typically produce a higher underwriting expense ratio than our principal product  property catastrophe reinsurance 
for our primary operations  the majority of the premiums written are currently ceded to other reinsurers and as a result  net earned premiums from the primary operations were relatively minor during  and based on this reduced level of net earned premiums  relatively modest one time adjustments to net written premiums  claims and claim expenses incurred  acquisition expenses or operating expenses can cause  and did cause  unusual fluctuations in the claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio of the primary operations 
because of its small scale  our primary insurance business does not materially affect the ratios of our consolidated operations 
as can be seen by the net underwriting losses of the primary operations during and  the primary operations are not a significant contributor to our consolidated operations 
subsequent to the september th tragedy  and the resulting insurance market turmoil  we currently expect that glencoe  our bermuda primary operation  will experience considerable growth in we also expect that the us primary operations of desoto  desoto prime and stonington will continue to be limited  and therefore we do not expect these entities to contribute significantly to our consolidated operations during  although these operations may grow if market conditions allow 
net investment income year ended december  in thousands    because we primarily provide reinsurance coverage for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  it is possible that we could become liable for a significant amount of losses on a short term notice 
accordingly we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains investments in fixed income securities  such as us government bonds  corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
as a result of the declining interest rate environment during  the average yield on our portfolio fell from as of december  to as of december  accordingly  as yields on our portfolio decrease  our interest income will also decrease  as was the case during partially offsetting this decrease was the significant growth in assets during the year  which was primarily due to our capital raising activities of issuing million of senior notes in july  issuing million common shares for million in net proceeds in october and issuing  million of series a preference shares in november at december   we had an unusually large allocation to cash  which resulted from our decision to wait to invest the proceeds of these capital transactions until we perceived more favorable market conditions 
in the short term this large cash allocation has depressed our investment returns 
during  the increase in investment income resulted primarily from an increase in interest rates  together with an increase in the investment base during the year 
although invested assets at december  only reflected an increase of million from the prior year end  we had an additional million in bank loans during most of  which was repaid during the fourth quarter of other income year ended december  in thousands    as discussed previously  in we began to manage property catastrophe books of business for the top layer re and op cat joint ventures 
we record our profit and or equity participation from these joint ventures as other income 
during  and other income included million  million and million of profits  respectively  from these two ventures 
the remainder of our other income relates to net results from small non underwriting portions of our operations  as well as minor activities with catastrophe and derivative instruments under which losses could be triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables 
in  other income included approximately million from our primary operations and million from our investments in non indemnity catastrophe index contracts 
in  contributions to other income from our primary operations and from trading in catastrophe linked index transactions were immaterial 
in  we reported million in other income relating to recoveries on catastrophe linked index transactions and million relating to other income from our primary operations 
during  we formed a third joint venture  davinci  in which we own of the equity 
due to the voting and governance structures of davinci  our income from this joint venture is not reflected in other income  but is instead consolidated in our financial statements 
our profit participation and equity participation in davinci will therefore be reflected primarily through underwriting income and investment income  partially offset by an increase in minority interest for the of davinci owned by third parties 
also  as discussed previously  since op cat has decided to cease its operations  and since we have decided to assume this book of business  our portion of the earnings from this book of business will  in the future  be reflected in our consolidated underwriting results and investment income instead of other income 
corporate expenses year ended december  in thousands    corporate expenses are incurred by us in running our non underwriting operations include expenses related to legal and certain consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
the majority of the increase in corporate expenses during primarily related to costs related to research and development initiatives conducted by us in fixed charges year ended december  in thousands interest revolving credit facilities    interest million senior notes  interest million capital securities    dividends million preference shares  total fixed charges    due to our financial strength  we have had the ability to access the capital markets for various forms of capital 
it is advantageous to have access to various forms of capital  as we therefore do not become dependant on any one source of capital 
furthermore  the cost and flexibility of each form of capital can help us to improve our return to common shareholders and at the same time  maintain a level of capital that allows us to grow our operations 
during  our total fixed charges decreased as a result of our repayment of million of borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan agreement in the fourth quarter of since the majority of these funds were borrowed in august  and due to the rising interest rates during and  this caused interest expense on our debt to increase in over interest expense in as a result of our issuance during of the senior notes and the preference shares  we expect our fixed charges to increase in compared to income tax expense benefit year ended december  in thousands    in  in conjunction with charges we recorded relating to our purchase and subsequent decision to significantly reduce the operations of stonington  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
this deferred tax asset relates primarily to net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxes payable of our us operating subsidiaries 
however  due to the limited opportunities in the us primary insurance market  the us insurance operations have not generated taxable income in the last few years 
this calls into question the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
although we retain the benefit of this asset through  during and during we recorded increases in our valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
as of december   the net balance of the deferred tax asset was million 
should our current us operations begin to generate taxable income  or should additional opportunities arise to conduct business in the us  the valuation allowance could be eliminated as profits are recorded  and we could possibly earn profits without a corresponding reduction for taxes 
realized gains losses year ended december  in thousands    during  net realized gains on sales of investments were million  compared to net realized losses of million in as noted above  because our portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  our gains and losses on investments will be highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
accordingly as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our portfolio  and as interest rates increase  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our portfolio 
financial condition as a holding company  we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and capital securities  and to make dividend payments to our preference shareholders and common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law 
us statutory regulations and the bermuda insurance act  amendments thereto and related regulations of bermuda  require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was  million  and the amount required to be maintained by the act was million 
our us subsidiaries are also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our us subsidiaries was million and the amount required to be maintained was million 
during  renaissance reinsurance declared aggregate cash dividends of million  compared with million in our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their own expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide sufficient liquidity to meet extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million credit facility to meet additional capital requirements  if necessary 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities for were million  which principally consisted of net income of million  plus million for losses incurred but not paid as of december   plus million of collections on losses recoverable 
the cash flows from operations were primarily utilized to reinvest in fixed income securities 
we have generated cash flows from operations in and in significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance business  we will consider using such capital to invest in new opportunities 
because of the nature of the coverages we provide  which typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
reserves for claims and claims expenses for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the claims and claim expense reserves 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  it is possible that our individual case reserves for each catastrophic event are incorrect  possibly materially 
the period of time from the reporting of a loss to us through the settlement of our liability may be several years 
during this period  additional facts and trends will be revealed and as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted 
therefore  changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant  or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
the impact on net income from changes in prior years loss reserves was an increase of million during  a decrease of million during and an increase of million in our principal business is property catastrophe reinsurance  which subjects us to potential losses that are generally infrequent  but can be significant  such as losses from hurricanes and earthquakes 
because the loss events to which we are exposed are generally characterized by low frequency but high severity  our claims and claim expense reserves will normally fluctuate  sometimes materially  based upon the occurrence of a significant natural or man made catastrophic loss for which we provide reinsurance 
our reserves will also fluctuate based on the payments we make for these large loss events 
as we pay losses related to these large events  if no other events have occurred  our loss reserves would normally tend to decrease 
the table below sets forth our gross and net claims and claim expense reserves for the previous eight years  compared with the balance of our shareholders equity 
percentage gross net shareholders of equity at december  reserves reserves equity gross net the above information further reflects how our gross reserves  as a percentage of equity  can fluctuate based on the occurrence of significant loss events 
for instance in  our gross reserves  and our gross reserves as a percentage of equity increased sharply  due to the nine significant loss events occurring in  many of which occurred in the last four months of the year see discussion of premiums above for a discussion of these events 
however  as also can be seen from the data above  because of our ability to purchase reasonably priced reinsurance  historically our net reserves as a percentage of equity have shown much less variation from year to year 
we generally expect that the majority of our losses from large catastrophic events will be paid in a two to four year time frame 
however  the event causing the loss  the locations of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers  can affect the time period in which our claims will be paid 
for instance  losses occurring in the us  tend to pay more quickly than those losses occurring in other parts of the world 
this trend is reflected in the current balance of our reserves  whereby seven of the nine events occurring in  occurred outside of the us  and accordingly  our claim payments on these losses have tended to pay slower than those on events occurring in the us also  the events impacted claims payments in and to a greater extent than normal because most of the events occurred late in the year  including the most severe events  which were the european storms in december 
for illustrative purposes  the table below sets forth our claim payments and claim developments for the accident year for our reinsurance segment through december  gross ceded net accident year reserves reserves reserves incurred reserves claim payments in reserve as of december  claim payments in reserve additions in reserves as of december  claim payments in reserve additions in reserves as of december  at december   and  the claims and claim expense reserves of the reinsurance segment were million  million and million  respectively  of the total reserves of the company 
also  as of december   and  of the total reserves of the reinsurance segment   and of the reserves  respectively  related to claims and claim expense reserves of the three most recent accident years 
as of december   and  included in our claims and claim expense reserves were reserves for incurred but not reported claims ibnr of million  million  and million  respectively 
during  our claims and claim expense reserves  our claims recoveries and our net reserves all increased as a result of losses we incurred from the world trade center tragedy 
during  as we pay losses related to the world trade center tragedy and other currently known loss events  if no additional significant loss events occur  we would expect the balance of our claims and claim expense reserves to decrease 
for our insurance and reinsurance operations  our estimates of claims reserves are based on claims reports from insureds  our underwriters experience in setting claims reserves  the use of computer models where applicable and historical industry claims experience 
where necessary we will also use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
we review our reserves on a regular basis 
capital resources our total capital resources at december  and were as follows at december  in thousands common shareholders equity   series a preference shares  total shareholders equity   senior notes  capital securities   revolving credit facility unborrowed   revolving credit facility borrowed  term and revolving loan facility   total capital resources   as is customary in our industry  a portion of our reinsurance policies provide our clients with the right to cancel or not renew our policies in the event our claims paying ratings are downgraded 
in some instances the downgrade must be to a rating several levels below our current rating  in others  the trigger level is somewhat higher  and in others it is only one or two levels below our current rating 
many of our policies do not contain a provision of this type 
moreover  we cannot precisely estimate the amount of premium that is at risk  as this amount depends on the particular facts and circumstances at the time  including the degree of the downgrade  the time elapsed on the impacted in force policies  and the effects of any related catastrophic event on the industry generally 
in the event any of these provisions are triggered  we will vigorously seek to retain our clients and do not anticipate that a material amount of premium would be cancelled or nonrenewed 
however  we can not assure you that our premiums would not decline  perhaps materially  following a ratings downgrade 
during  as a result of the world trade center disaster  two results occurred in the reinsurance market 
first  reinsurers recorded significant losses and were forced to  or chose to  withdraw their underwriting capacity for certain lines of reinsurance 
second  these losses raised the awareness of the severity of the losses which could occur 
these factors caused an imbalance in the supply of and demand for reinsurance and  as a result  prices escalated for many segments of the reinsurance market 
these imbalances provided us with an opportunity to increase our penetration of the property catastrophe reinsurance market  as well as provided us with opportunities to grow other areas of our operations  specifically our specialty reinsurance operations and our commercial property insurance operations written through glencoe insurance 
with these increased opportunities to grow our businesses  we also decided to materially increase our capital resources through the following activities in october  we issued million of common shares for net proceeds of million 
in november  we raised million in net proceeds through the issuance of  par value series a preference shares at per share 
the shares are non convertible and may be redeemed at per share on or after november  dividends are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable quarterly in arrears at when  if  and as  declared by our board of directors 
under certain circumstances  such as amalgamations and changes to bermuda law requiring approval of the holders of our preference shares to vote as a single class  we may redeem the shares prior to november  at per share 
the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any of our other securities 
in july we issued million of senior notes due july we used a portion of the proceeds to repay million of outstanding amounts under our million revolving credit and term loan agreement 
we can redeem the notes prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium  however  we currently have no intentions of calling the notes 
the notes  which are senior obligations  pay interest semi annually and contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restriction as to the disposition of stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens on the stock of designated subsidiaries 
we also formed davinci  our third joint venture  in october to form davinci  we raised million of outside capital million as of december  and we utilized million of our capital when we contributed million as equity and provided million as bridge financing 
in the first half of  we expect davinci to replace our million of bridge financing with bank debt which  because we are consolidating davinci  will increase the outstanding debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  in conjunction with market opportunities following the september th tragedy  we contributed an additional million of capital to glencoe  thereby increasing its total capital to greater than million 
we continue to maintain a revolving credit and term loan agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
during the third quarter of  we repaid borrowings of million on this facility and as of december  no amounts were outstanding 
in the fourth quarter of we repaid million of the then outstanding balance 
interest rates on the facility are based on a spread above libor and averaged during  compared to in our revolving credit agreement contains certain financial covenants including requirements that consolidated debt to capital does not exceed a ratio of  consolidated net worth must exceed the greater of million or of consolidated debt  and of invested assets must be rated bbb or better 
we were in compliance with all the covenants of this revolving credit and term loan agreement at december  renaissance us has a million term loan and million revolving loan facility with a syndicate of commercial banks  each of which is guaranteed by renaissancere 
interest rates on the facility are based upon a spread above libor  and averaged during  compared to in the related agreements contain certain financial covenants  including a covenant that renaissancere  as principal guarantor  maintain a ratio of liquid assets to debt service of the term loan has mandatory repayment provisions approximating million per year in each of years and the loan facility of million is repayable in during  renaissance us repaid approximately million of this facility 
we were in compliance with all the covenants of this term loan and revolving loan facility at december  our subsidiary  renaissancere capital trust has issued capital securities which pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
during  we purchased million of these capital securities recognizing a gain of million which has been reflected in shareholders equity 
no securities were purchased during the sole asset of the trust consists of our junior subordinated debentures in an amount equal to the outstanding capital securities 
the indenture relating to these junior subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a covenant prohibiting us from the payment of dividends if we are in default under the indenture 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture at december  the capital trust securities mature on march  generally accepted accounting principles do not allow these securities to be classified as a component of shareholders equity  therefore  they are reflected as minority interest 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  we may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our letters of credit are secured by a lien on a portion of our investment portfolio 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating million  compared to million in this increase is primarily related to the losses emanating from the september th tragedy 
also  in connection with our top layer re joint venture we have committed million of collateral to support a letter of credit 
in order to encourage employee ownership of common shares  we have guaranteed certain loan and pledge agreements between certain employees and bank of america  illinois bofa 
pursuant to the terms of this employee credit facility  bofa has agreed to loan the participating employees up to an aggregate of million 
the balance outstanding at december  was million  compared to million in each loan under this employee credit facility is required to be initially collateralized by the respective participating employee with common shares or other collateral acceptable to bofa 
if the value of the collateral provided by a participating employee subsequently decreases  the participating employee is required to contribute additional collateral in the amount of such deficiency  failing which bofa can accelerate the loan and liquidate the remaining collateral 
loans under this employee credit facility are otherwise non recourse to the participating employees 
given the level of collateral  we do not presently anticipate that we will be required to honor any guarantees under the employee credit facility  although there can be no assurance that we will not be so required in the future 
shareholders equity during  shareholders equity increased by million  from million at december  to billion at december  the significant components of the change in shareholders equity included net income from continuing operations of million  million received from the issuance of million series a preference shares  and million received from the issuance of million common shares  offset by the payment of dividends of million 
at december   shareholders equity attributable to common shareholders was billion 
from time to time  we have returned capital to our shareholders through share repurchase programs 
at december   we had million remaining under our existing program 
during  we purchased  common shares for an aggregate value of million 
during  we repurchased  common shares for an aggregate value of million 
no shares were repurchased during investments at december   we held cash and investments totaling billion  compared to billion in  with net unrealized appreciation of million  compared to unrealized appreciation of million in because we primarily provide coverage for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we may become liable for substantial claim payments on short term notice 
accordingly  our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains investments in fixed income securities  such as us government bonds  corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the table below shows the aggregate amounts of investments available for sale  other investments and cash and cash equivalents comprising our portfolio of invested assets at december  in thousands investments available for sale  at fair value   other investments   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments   total invested assets   the growth in our portfolio of invested assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of million  million raised from the issuance of million common shares  million received from the issuance of million series a preference shares  million raised from the issuance of senior notes and million of third party investment in our most recent joint venture  davinci reinsurance 
at year end  we had an unusually large allocation to cash  which resulted from our decision to wait to invest the proceeds of these capital transactions until we perceived more favorable market conditions  in the short term  this large cash allocation has depressed our investment returns 
over time  we expect our cash position to return to historical levels 
our current investment guidelines call for the invested asset portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  to have at least an average aa rating as measured by standard poor s ratings group 
at december   our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa  an average duration of years and an average yield to maturity of 
catastrophe linked instruments we have assumed risk through catastrophe and derivative instruments under which losses could be triggered by an industry loss index or geological or physical variables 
during  and we recorded recoveries on non indemnity catastrophe index transactions of million  nil  and million  respectively 
we report these recoveries in other income 
we cannot provide any assurances that this performance will continue 
market sensitive instruments our investment portfolio includes investments which are subject to changes in market values with changes in interest rates 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in total return of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million at december  at december   the decrease in total return would have been  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million 
the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
currency our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
our current foreign currency policy is to hold foreign currency assets  including cash and receivables  that approximate the net monetary foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
all changes in the exchange rates are recognized currently in our statement of income 
when necessary we will seek to hedge our exposure to foreign currency transactions through the use of options  swaps and or forward contracts 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding options  swaps or forward contracts related to foreign currency exposure 
effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
off balance sheet and special purpose entity arrangements as of december   we have not entered into any guarantees  or guaranteed the liabilities of any non consolidated affiliates or subsidiaries or other non related parties 
new accounting pronouncement effective january  we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer being amortized but are reviewed periodically for impairment 
the adoption of sfas had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
current outlook the september th tragedy has caused significant changes to the market environment 
many insurance and reinsurance companies are seeking and receiving higher prices for the risks that they assume and have substantially reduced their exposures  including various exclusions for acts of terrorism and acts of war 
these actions are being taken as a result of an increased perception of risk for the industry in general  as well as an improved understanding of the correlation between  and within  various classes of business that were previously believed to be independent by other companies 
in addition  there is a heightened sensitivity to credit quality as a number of other insurance companies have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings 
because renaissancere experienced relatively limited losses from the world trade center tragedy  and continues to have stable  high credit ratings  we believe we are well positioned to significantly increase our managed catastrophe premiums 
in addition  we are anticipating that we will expand our presence in the specialty reinsurance coverages  which by our definition are coverages that are not specifically property catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
in evaluating opportunities in the specialty reinsurance market  we focus on those coverages which  like property catastrophe reinsurance  produce losses that are infrequent in nature  but could be severe if they occur 
examples include aviation  satellite  finite and catastrophe exposed workers compensation coverages 
we also anticipate that we will increase the premiums written by our bermuda based primary insurance company  glencoe 
glencoe  which primarily provides catastrophe exposed primary property coverage on an excess and surplus lines basis  wrote million of gross written premiums in as a result of the world trade center tragedy  we expect the cost of reinsurance protection to increase during if prices rise to levels whereby we believe the purchase of reinsurance protection would become uneconomical  we may retain a greater level of net risk in certain geographic regions 
in order to obtain longer term retrocessional capacity  we have entered into multi year contracts with respect to a portion of our portfolio 
the world trade center tragedy has caused insurers and reinsurers to seek to limit their potential exposures to losses from terrorism attacks 
we often exlcude terrorism in the reinsurance and insurance that we write  but do have potential exposures to this risk 
we are monitoring our aggregate exposures to terrorist attacks 
subsequent to the world trade center tragedy  a substantial amount of capital has entered the insurance and reinsurance markets both through investments in established companies and through start up ventures 
the addition of new capital in the marketplace may cause a reduction in prices of reinsurance contracts  or could shorten the time horizon of the price increases for reinsurance contracts 
currently  however  we do not believe that the new capital has resulted in adverse changes to the prevailing pricing structure in the property catastrophe reinsurance market 
to the extent that the newly formed companies or established companies were to reduce the pricing of their products  this could force us to reduce our future underwriting premiums
