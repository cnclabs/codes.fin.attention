item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto set forth in item critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due  to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  we have created approximately a general reserve for bad debt based upon the total accounts receivable balance 
we believe that is a reasonably conservative reserve  as write offs were less than for each of the proceeding three years 
in addition  we deem the general reserve may be necessary due to the change in economic conditions 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
on a quarterly basis  the company compares the amount of the inventory on hand and under commitment with its latest forecasted requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
although the writedowns for excess or obsolete inventory reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and are considered adequate by the company s management  there can be no assurance that these writedowns will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with the company s inventory 
at december   the company had only one product  the photomask repair system  with a carrying value making up more than of the total inventory 
in december  the company had an inventory write down of approximately million  which was largely related to a specific vendor part where reliability was an issue 
in addition the marking operations of baublys gmbh and control laser corporation were merged  which also resulted in inventory write offs of approximately thousand 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   the company has approximately million of net deferred tax assets related principally to domestic and foreign loss carryforwards and inventory reserves 
should the pretax book income and taxable income be considerably lower than projected  an increase to the valuation allowance may be required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on demand deposits with banks and money market funds and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates the company manages its cash and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolios consist primarily of cash and equivalents  with carrying amounts approximating market value
