consolidated results in thousands years ended december earnings from continuing operations before unusual items    per diluted common share earnings from continuing operations    per diluted common share weighted average shares outstanding diluted    unusual items represent year expense and restructuring and other charges 
management believes that pro forma operating results provide additional information useful in analyzing the underlying business results 
however  pro forma operating results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  reported results of operations 
in  earnings from continuing operations  before and after unusual items  include a one time reduction in deferred taxes of million  or per diluted common share  as a result of a change in canadian tax law that affected the company s canadian operations 
earnings from continuing operations decreased percent in and increased percent in the decrease in earnings from continuing operations in is due primarily to increased restructuring and other charges as part of the company s implementation of strategic initiatives during to reduce company expenses and improve profitability

such decrease was due to volume reductions in the us and in latin america attributable to the continued worldwide economic slowdown and to the sale of the contracts and related net assets associated with the disposal of the outbound auto carriage business of the company s brazilian scs operation vehiculos see further details in restructuring and other charges  net 
fms experienced a revenue decrease of percent due primarily to decreases in fuel sales volumes throughout the year combined with decreases in fuel prices in the fourth quarter of for all years reported  the company realized minimal changes in margin as a result of fluctuations in fuel revenue 
in addition  fms experienced decreases in revenue due to reduced demand for rental vehicles 
revenue was also reduced by the impact of exchange rates on translation of foreign subsidiary revenues  particularly those in the uk and brazil where exchange rates with the uk dollar have decreased by approximately percent and percent  respectively  from revenue from continuing operations increased percent in compared with  led by scs  which grew percent 
fms posted revenue gains of percent  due primarily to increased fuel revenue resulting from increases in related fuel prices 
the fms segment leases revenue earning equipment  sells fuel and provides maintenance and other ancillary services to the scs and dcc segments 
eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties 
in thousands years ended december operating expense    percentage of revenue operating expense decreased percent in compared with the decrease was a result of a reduction in fuel costs as a result of lower volumes and prices  a reduction in overheads due to the company implementing cost containment actions throughout and a reduction in fleet maintenance and licensing costs due to a reduced fleet size 
operating expense increased percent in compared with the increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel costs due to fuel price increases 
in thousands years ended december salaries and employee related costs    percentage of revenue salaries and employee related costs decreased million  or percent  in compared with the decrease was a result of planned reductions in headcount due to the company implementing its strategic initiatives throughout the number of employees at december  was approximately  compared with slightly over  at december  such salary decrease was largely offset by a reduction in net pension income in compared with net pension income was million and million in and  respectively  and principally benefits fms 
pension income from the company s primary us pension plan is partially offset by pension expense from the company s other pension plans 
the company has calculated preliminary pension estimates for based on interest rate  participation and other assumptions and the market related value of plan assets as of december  based on these estimates  the company would anticipate recording million to million in net pension expense in for all pension plans 
such estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis of all pension plans 
the expected increase in net pension expense is attributable primarily to the us pension plan and reflects the adverse effect of negative asset returns in as well as a declining interest rate environment causing a lower discount rate 
the anticipated net pension expense in would primarily impact fms  which employs the majority of the company s employees that participate in the company s primary us pension plan 
salaries and employee related costs increased million  or percent  in compared with the increase was due primarily to increased salaries and wages  specifically in scs  as a result of higher business volumes and higher outside driver costs  offset by increased net pension income in in thousands years ended december freight under management expense    percentage of revenue freight under management expense fum represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which the company purchases transportation 
fum expense decreased million  or percent  in the decrease was due to revenue reductions in related operating units of the scs business segment as a result of reduced freight volumes  decreases in the uk due to lost business and decreases in south america as a result of the sale of vehiculos 
fum expense increased million  or percent  in compared with the increase was due primarily to increased freight volumes in the vehiculos operation  which was sold in in thousands years ended december depreciation expense    gains on vehicle sales  net    equipment rental    depreciation expense decreased by million  or percent  in compared with depreciation expense decreased by million  or percent  in compared with decreases in depreciation expense for both years resulted principally from sale leaseback and other leasing transactions which increased the number of leased compared with owned vehicles in the company s fleet 
in  the decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense associated with the reduction of estimated residual values associated with certain classes of tractors 
gains on vehicle sales decreased million  or percent  in compared with gains on vehicle sales decreased to million in from million in decreases in gains on vehicle sales for both years were due to continuing weak demand in the used truck market 
such weakness began to impact the company during the second quarter of during  average sales proceeds per unit decreased by approximately percent compared with however  the average book value per unit of units sold in was approximately percent lower than that of units sold in as a result of the aforementioned increase in depreciation expense due to reductions in estimated residual values 
the company periodically reviews and adjusts residual values  reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
see further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees at accounting matters 
the company believes that its carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate 
however  a greater than anticipated decline in the market for used vehicles may require the company to further adjust such values and estimates 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment 
equipment rental costs increased percent in and percent in the increases were due to sale leaseback transactions  including securitization transactions  as well as increases in reserves for guaranteed lease termination values to reflect decreases in the estimated residual values of leased equipment 
in thousands years ended december interest expense    percentage of revenue interest expense decreased percent in compared with  due primarily to debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the aforementioned sale leaseback transactions and generally lower interest rates compared with interest expense decreased percent in due primarily to lower commercial paper interest rates  debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the rpts sale and the impact of sale leaseback transactions completed beginning in december in thousands years ended december miscellaneous income expense  net    the company had net miscellaneous income of million in compared with net miscellaneous expense of million in the change was primarily due to lower costs related to the decreased use of the company s revolving facility for the sale of trade receivables combined with increased servicing fee income related to administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts related to the company s securitization transactions

the increase in the company s effective tax rate was partially offset by a permanent reduction in corporate tax rates in canada 
this resulted in a one time reduction in the company s related deferred taxes of approximately million 
the company believes the impact of this tax rate change on its future effective income tax rate will be nominal

contribution margin represents each business segment s revenue  less direct costs and direct overheads related to the segment s operations 
business segment contribution margin for all segments net of eliminations  less css expenses and restructuring and other charges  is equal to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
css are those costs incurred to support all business segments  including sales and marketing  human resources  finance  shared management information systems  customer solutions  health and safety  legal and communications

equipment contribution included in scs contribution margin in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
equipment contribution included in dcc contribution margin in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense is primarily allocated to the fms business segment since such borrowings are used principally to fund the purchase of revenue earning equipment used in fms 
these results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
fleet management solutions fms revenue decreased percent in compared with full service lease and program maintenance revenue remained relatively flat in compared with the company anticipates generally flat to slightly lower full service lease and program maintenance revenue in due to negative net sales over recent periods primarily as a result of the slowing us economy as well as decreases in variable billings  which are generally a function of total miles run by leased vehicles 
net sales takes into consideration new business with new or existing customers and revenue changes with existing customers due to replacement vehicles or rate changes  net of full service leases that reach the end of their term during the reported period 
all elements of commercial rental revenue consisting of pure rental  lease extra and await new lease revenue decreased in compared with in the us  pure rental revenue total rental revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers decreased percent to million in compared with due to the slowing economy

in the us  lease extra revenue decreased percent to million in await new lease revenue represents revenue on rental vehicles provided to new full service lease customers who have not taken delivery of full service lease units 
in  await new lease revenue decreased percent to million in the us such revenue declines were due to lower utilization  a decrease in the number of units in the rental fleet and shorter lead times to place full service lease vehicles into service compared with rental fleet utilization was percent in  compared with percent in rental fleet utilization decreased less than rental revenue as a result of the implementation of planned reductions in the size of the rental fleet 
pure rental revenue  lease extra  await new lease and rental fleet utilization statistics are monitored for the us only  however  management believes such metrics to be indicative of rental product performance for the company as a whole 
fuel revenue decreased in due primarily to decreased sales volume and  secondly  due to reduced sales prices 
fms revenue increased percent in compared with full service lease and program maintenance revenue increased in compared with as a result of growth in both fleet size and average revenue per unit 
commercial rental revenue decreased in compared with due to increased revenue in as a result of a backlog in the arrival of new vehicles for full service lease customers

in  fuel revenue increased as a result of increases in fuel prices 
fms realized minimal changes in margin as a result of fuel price increases 
contribution margin as a percentage of dry revenue revenue excluding fuel decreased to percent in compared with percent in and was flat in compared with the decrease in was attributable to the decrease in gains from the sale of equipment due to weakened used truck market demand  lower net pension income in compared with and decreased rental contribution margin resulting from the decline in rental revenue 
in  improvements in full service lease margins  decreased running costs and the impact of net pension income on benefits costs were offset by reduced gains in vehicle sales compared with decreased running costs in were generally attributable to a decrease in the average age of the fleet

these vehicles may be temporarily out of service  being prepared for sale or not rented due to lack of demand 
supply chain solutions scs revenue decreased percent in compared with mostly due to volume reductions in north america and latin america as a result of the continued worldwide economic slowdown 
in north america  volume reductions experienced in the company s automotive operating unit were the result of reduced auto production 
the electronics and high tech operating units saw reduced volumes due to slowed consumer demand in those sectors combined with lost business in volume decreases in latin america were due to the slowing economies in brazil and argentina and to the sale of vehiculos in additionally  revenue reductions occurred in due to the impact of exchange rates on translation of foreign subsidiaries  particularly in the uk and brazil  as well as to lost business in the uk such revenue decreases were partially offset by business expansion in mexico and asia

such initiatives in these areas included ending the company s sponsorship of the doral ryder open  the sale of the company s corporate jet and reducing the spending rate for new technology projects  respectively 
css increased percent in compared with due to increased spending for mis 
additionally  in  css was reduced by a million gain on a real estate sale as well as million of interest income earned on temporarily investing the proceeds from the rpts sale 
currently  contribution margin is the measure of segment financial performance that is primarily relied upon by management 
in  the company began a project to allocate css expenses to each business segment  as appropriate 
the objective is to provide management more clarity on the profitability of each business segment similar to a earnings before income taxes or nbt measure and  ultimately  to hold leadership of each business segment  and each operating segment within each business segment  accountable for their allocated share of css expenses 
this new measure of segment profitability  contribution margin after allocated css  is still under refinement by the company and is being reported to the company s chief operating decision maker periodically 
beginning in  the company intends to complete its refinement of the allocation methodology and will utilize contribution margin after allocated css as its primary measurement of segment financial performance 
however  the company has decided to provide contribution margin after allocated css by business segment as additional information through the end of its refinement period which is year end certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and as such  remain unallocated in css 
included among the unallocated overhead remaining within css are the costs for investor relations  corporate communications  public affairs and certain executive compensation 
those css costs attributable to the business segments are generally allocated to fms  scs and dcc as follows 
sales and marketing  finance  corporate services and health and safety allocated based upon estimated and planned resource utilization 

human resources individual costs within this category are allocated in several ways  including allocation based on estimated utilization and number of personnel supported 

mis allocated principally based upon utilization related metrics such as number of users or minutes of cpu time 

customer solutions represents project costs and expenses incurred in excess of amounts billable to a customer during the period 
expenses are allocated to the business segment responsible for the project 

other where allocated  the allocation is based on the number of personnel supported

after tax earnings from discontinued operations amounted to million in the transaction generated gains from the settlement and curtailment of certain employee benefit and postretirement plans  offset by provisions for severance and direct transaction and other costs 
the rpts disposal has been accounted for as discontinued operations and accordingly  its operating results and cash flows are segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

as a result of the decrease in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold  the company s accounts receivable balance increased percent to million at december  compared with december  cash used in financing activities slightly decreased in compared with as the company s increased net borrowings were almost offset by decreased use of its commercial paper program due primarily to interest rate decreases in the company s other funding facilities compared with the company s commercial paper program 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in compared with was attributable to lower capital expenditures in higher proceeds provided from the sale leaseback of revenue earning equipment in see financing and other funding transactions were offset by decreased proceeds from the sales of property and revenue earning equipment primarily due to continued weak demand in the used truck market 
cash provided by operating activities increased in compared with primarily due to increases in trade receivables sold in and lower working capital needs in cash used in financing activities decreased in compared with during  cash of million was used in financing activities  primarily to repurchase million of common stock and reduce debt by million 
the stock repurchase program was completed in and there was no such program in or cash used in investing activities was million compared with cash provided by investing activities of million in in  cash provided by investing activities was the result of proceeds from the rpts sale 
after adjusting for such proceeds  cash used in investing activities decreased in compared with primarily as a result of reduced levels of capital expenditures 
the following is a summary of capital expenditures in thousands years ended december revenue earning equipment    operating property and equipment    the decrease in capital expenditures in was principally due to reduced demand for new units as well as increased pricing discipline over new business  which has resulted in fewer sales but improved margins on business sold 
the company has worked to improve controls over capital expenditures and reduce the volume of early terminations of full service leases compared with in contrast to  the company is pursuing a strategy of extending certain full service leases rather than leasing new units 
this allows the company to further control capital expenditures while frequently providing customers with vehicles at favorable pre owned rates compared with rates on new units 
the company expects to fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings 
such capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately million in the decrease in capital spending in was planned based upon the significant increase in capital spending and fleet replacement in fms that took place during the first half of capital spending for was consistent with management s expectations of anticipated growth and fleet replacement in full service leasing and commercial rental 
however  capital spending was significantly above plan during the first half of the excess spending reflected higher than anticipated requirements for replacement 
no acquisitions were completed in during and  the company completed a few immaterial acquisitions  each of which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
total consideration for these acquisitions was million in and million in the company will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in fms and scs in financing and other funding transactions ryder utilizes external capital to support growth in its asset based product lines 
the company has a variety of financing alternatives available to fund its capital needs 
these alternatives include long term and medium term public and private debt  including asset backed securities  bank term loans and leasing arrangements as well as fixed rate and variable rate financing available through bank credit facilities  commercial paper and receivable conduits 
the company also periodically enters into sale leaseback agreements on revenue earning equipment  which are primarily accounted for as operating leases 
debt totaled billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of the decrease in debt in was principally due to repayment of million in debentures in addition to a decrease of million in commercial paper borrowings  which were repaid with proceeds of sale leaseback transactions described below 
in addition to the company s reduced debt in  receivables sold decreased million in compared with decreased debt levels and reduced overall funding needs were generally the result of reduced levels of capital expenditures on revenue earning equipment 
debt totaled billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of the decrease in debt in was principally due to repayment of million in medium term notes  net of an increase of million in commercial paper borrowing

as a result  the company would have to rely on other established funding sources described below 
the company s debt to equity and related ratios were as follows december debt to equity total obligations to equity total obligations to equity  including securitizations debt to equity consists of the company s on balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity

the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for equipment  discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease total obligations to equity  including securitizations consists of total obligations  described above  plus the present value of contingent rentals under the company s securitizations assuming customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due  discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the trust  all divided by total equity 
the decrease in all of the above ratios in was driven by the company s reduced funding needs as a result of decreases in purchases of revenue earning equipment 
for  the company anticipates additional reductions in each of these ratios due to expected improvements in operating cash flow and reduced cash needs due to planned further reductions in capital expenditures 
during  the company replaced its million global revolving credit facility with a new million global revolving credit facility 
the new facility is composed of million which matures in may and is renewable annually and is in the process of being renewed  and million which matures in may the primary purposes of the credit facility are to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
at the company s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
the credit facility s annual facility fee ranges from to basis points applied to the total facility of million based on the company s current credit ratings 
foreign borrowings of million were outstanding under the facility at december  in order to maintain availability of funding  the global revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  of less than or equal to percent 
the ratio at december  was percent 
in september  the company filed an million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec 
proceeds from debt issues under the shelf registration are available for capital expenditures  debt refinancing and general corporate purposes 
the company participates in an agreement  as amended from time to time  to sell with limited recourse up to million of trade receivables on a revolving basis 
this agreement expires in july the company sells the receivables in order to fund the company s operations  particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other means of funding  notably  commercial paper 
the receivables are sold first to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  ryder receivables funding llc rrf llc  that is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
rrf llc then sells certain receivables to unrelated commercial entities at a loss  which approximates the purchaser s financing cost of issuing its own commercial paper backed by the trade receivables over the period of anticipated collection 
the company is responsible for servicing receivables sold but has no retained interests 
at december  and  the outstanding balance of receivables sold pursuant to this agreement was million and million  respectively 
losses on receivable sales associated with this program were million in  million in and million in and are included in miscellaneous income expense  net 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful receivables based on the expected collectibility of all receivables  including receivables sold 
the decrease in trade receivables sold since december  is due to a reduced need for cash as a result of the sale leaseback transaction completed in described below as well as increased use of the company s other funding facilities 
see receivables in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the company s sale of receivables 
as of december  the company had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities in millions global revolving credit facility limited to less than one year shelf registration statement trade receivables facility the company believes such facilities  along with the company s commercial paper program and other funding sources  will be sufficient to fund operations in in addition to the financing activities described above  the company executes sale leaseback transactions with third party financial institutions as well as with substantive special purpose entities spes which facilitate sale leaseback transactions with multiple third party investors securitizations 
in general  sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet  as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt 
accordingly  sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense 
sale leaseback transactions including securitizations are generally executed from time to time for the following reasons 
to lower the total cost of funding the company s operations 
to diversify the company s funding among different classes of investors eg regional banks  pension plans  insurance companies  etc 

to diversify the company s funding among different types of funding instruments proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in the sale leaseback transactions in and were vehicle securitization transactions in which the company sold a beneficial interest in certain leased vehicles to separately rated and unconsolidated vehicle lease trusts and subsequently entered into an operating lease program operating lease with those trusts 
a prospectus for each transaction is on file with the sec 
such securitizations generated cash proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
the vehicles were sold for approximately their carrying value 
the company retained an interest in the vehicle lease trusts in the form of subordinated notes issued at the date of each sale 
the company has provided credit enhancement for each sale in the form of a one time up front cash reserve deposit and a pledge of the subordinated notes  including interest thereon  as additional security for the trusts to the extent that payments under the program operating leases are not made due to delinquencies and incurred losses under the program operating leases and related vehicle sales 
the trusts rely on collections from the program operating leases  sales proceeds from the disposition of such vehicles and cash reserve funds to make payments to investors 
the trusts are solely liable for such payments to investors  who are all independent of the company 
other than the credit enhancement noted above  the company does not guarantee investors interests in the securitization trusts 
see leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the company s securitization transactions 
the following table summarizes the company s undiscounted on and off balance sheet contractual cash obligations and contingent rentals at december  in thousands thereafter total long term debt        capital leases      total debt        operating leases a        total contractual cash obligations        contingent rentals b        total        a the amounts in the previous table are based upon the assumption that revenue earning equipment will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements 
no effect has been given to renewals  cancellations  contingent rentals or future rate changes  except as described below for vehicle securitization transactions 
b contingent rentals relate to the company s vehicle securitization transactions 
the timing and amount of payment of rent by the company for securitized vehicles is dependent on the timing and amount of payments received from the company s customers for use of such vehicles  as stipulated by the program operating lease 
for purposes of this presentation  the company has assumed that the full monthly payment for each vehicle is received from the customer exactly when such payment is due  and that there are no defaults  prepayments or early termination of leases between the company and its customers 
contingent rentals in the table above are estimated based upon this assumption 
the actual amount and timing of contingent rentals paid by the company may vary from that assumed above 
certain of the company s agreements for the sale and operating leaseback of revenue earning equipment contain purchase and or renewal options as well as limited guarantees of the lessor s residual value residual value guarantees 
the company s reserve for residual value guarantees was million at december  see discussion on depreciation and rental of revenue earning equipment at accounting matters for a further discussion on residual value guarantees 
at december   the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which primarily guarantee certain insurance activities 
certain of these letters of credit guarantee insurance activities associated with insurance claim liabilities transferred in conjunction with the sale of certain businesses reported as discontinued operations in previous years 
to date  such insurance claims  representing per claim deductibles payable under third party insurance policies  have been paid by the companies that assumed such liabilities 
however  if all or a portion of such assumed claims of approximately million are unable to be paid  the third party insurers may have recourse against certain of the outstanding letters of credit provided by the company in order to satisfy the unpaid claim deductibles 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
the company manages such exposures in several ways  including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
the company does not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
the company s interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  the company also uses an interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of its debt instruments to that of its portfolio of assets 
at december   an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million was outstanding  which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge of fixed rate debt 
no interest rate swap or cap agreements were outstanding at december  the following tables summarize debt obligations outstanding as of december  and expressed in us dollar equivalents 
the tables show the amount of debt  including current portion  and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  and this information should be read in conjunction with the debt note to the consolidated financial statements 
expected maturity date years ended december in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt dollar denominated         average interest rate pound sterling denominated     average interest rate canadian dollar denominated      average interest rate other        average interest rate variable rate debt dollar denominated a      average interest rate pound sterling denominated      average interest rate canadian dollar denominated    average interest rate other    average interest rate total debt excluding capital leases   a includes commercial paper which is assumed to be renewed through may 
as discussed in the debt note to the consolidated financial statements  the commercial paper program is supported by the company s million global credit facility which is composed of million which matures in may and is renewable annually  and million which matures in march 
the company classified commercial paper borrowings as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and expected maturity date years ended december in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt dollar denominated         average interest rate pound sterling denominated     average interest rate canadian dollar denominated       average interest rate other      average interest rate variable rate debt dollar denominated     average interest rate pound sterling denominated     average interest rate canadian dollar denominated    average interest rate other     average interest rate total debt excluding capital leases   exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
no foreign currency option contracts or forward agreements were outstanding at december  or the company does not generally hedge the translation exposure related to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since the company generally has no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies  the lack of transactions between the company and its foreign subsidiaries and the level of net investment in foreign subsidiaries  the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not material 
exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a portion of the company s service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
as of december   the company had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
none of the company s current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased and as such the company is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices 
increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to customers and have only a minor effect on contribution margins 
the company believes the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the operations of the company involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require the company to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  the company has upgraded operating facilities and implemented various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million in and the company incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses  such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
the increase in expenses in reflected the impact of lower claim recoveries compared with lower environmental expenses in resulted from increased claim recoveries and a decrease in the number of projects compared with the ultimate cost of the company s environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
see environmental matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
euro conversion on january   the participating countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
on january   the euro began circulation within the participating countries  with the existing national currencies continuing as legal tender through february   at which time the existing national currencies were completely removed from circulation 
the euro was adopted as functional currency in the operations of the company s subsidiaries in germany and netherlands 
at december   total assets were million and million in germany and netherlands  respectively  and equity was million and million in germany and netherlands  respectively 
due to the nature and small magnitude of current international operations affected by the euro conversion  conversion to the euro did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
accounting matters critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in the footnotes to the company s financial statements 
certain of these policies are considered to be critical 
that is  they are both the most important to the financial presentation of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting policies that management considers to be critical 
self insurance reserves management uses a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate required self insurance reserves 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  management considers such factors as frequency and severity of claims  claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of the company s business  among other factors 
on an annual basis  the company s self insurance reserves are reviewed for reasonableness by third party actuaries 
the company s estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services  unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process  among other factors 
while management believes that self insurance reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates may not occur 
at december   self insurance reserves were million 
depreciation and residual value guarantees the company periodically reviews and adjusts the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment as described in revenue earning equipment  operating property and equipment and depreciation and residual value guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reductions in residual values the price at which the company ultimately expects to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment 
the company reviews residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of revenue earning equipment 
reviews are performed based on vehicle class  generally subcategories of trucks  tractors and trailers by weight and usage 
the company considers such factors as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles  expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles eg rental fleet  scs and dcc applications 
future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors 
the company also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements 
certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment 
results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease 
the amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease 
at december   total liabilities for residual value guarantees of million were included in accrued expenses for those payable in less than one year and in other non current liabilities 
while management believes that the amounts are adequate  changes to management s estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles  the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized 
in determining the required level of such allowance  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is based on management s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods 
such assessment  and thus the related valuation allowance  is subject to change based on changes in anticipated future taxable earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations as no business combinations were initiated after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   with certain early adoption permitted 
the company will adopt sfas effective january  and is currently assessing its impact on the company s financial statements  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
however  at the date of this report  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting sfas  which will be effective for  on its results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
sfas also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by the company effective january  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its results of operations  cash flows or financial position

other accounting matters in january  the company revised its vacation policy in the us starting january   employees earn vacation based on the calendar year rather than their anniversary date 
additionally  unused earned vacation may not be carried forward into the next calendar year 
at december   the company s vacation accrual for us employees was approximately million 
as a result of the policy change  the balance was approximately million at december  which represents vacation accrual for california employees where local law did not permit the adoption of the revised policy
