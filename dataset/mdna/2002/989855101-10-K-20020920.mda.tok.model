item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  warranty costs  accounting for incomes taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  there is no significant risk pertaining to customer acceptance  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgement is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for the company s products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory and losses on contracts 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company considers historical warranty costs actually incurred to establish the warranty liability 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an estimated amount based on historical and forecasted results 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  and an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal on december   the company sold its automation systems group in longmont  colorado  to brooks automation  inc of chelmsford  massachusetts  in a cash transaction  for  substantially all of the assets were sold to brooks and substantially all of the liabilities were assumed by brooks 
the gain on the sale was  before related exit costs of  to be paid from the proceeds  inventory write downs of  and tax expense of  net sales of  for fiscal decreased by  or  from fiscal net sales of  for fiscal  net sales in the semiconductor segment were  or of total net sales  as compared to  or  in the prior year period  net sales in the industrial segment were  or of total net sales  as compared to  or  in the prior year period  and net sales in the telecommunications segment were  or of total net sales  as compared to  or  in the prior year period 
the decrease in sales is primarily due to a decrease in units sold  reflecting the downturn in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
company sales to the americas  primarily the united states  amounted to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal levels of  the company s sales to outside the americas amounted to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal levels of  sales to japan during fiscal amounted to  a decrease of  or  from fiscal sales levels 
sales to europe other  primarily europe  amounted to  an increase of  or  from fiscal sales to the pacific rim  excluding japan  amounted to  an increase of  or  from sales levels 
substantially all of the company s sales and costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact the sales of the company s products in its export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
the impact of such changes in foreign currency values on the company s sales cannot be measured

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal amounted to  a decrease of  or  from fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a for fiscal resulted from lower incentive compensation costs due to lower sales volumes and net losses for fiscal research  development and engineering expenses r d in fiscal totaled  and increased by  or  from fiscal r d as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the continued investment in the semiconductor segment  primarily in the motion measurement product line  through the first three quarters of fiscal amortization expense of  for fiscal increased by  or  from fiscal levels of  the company s operating loss in fiscal was  including  of exit costs and  of inventory write downs related to the sale of the automation systems group in longmont  colorado  as compared to an operating profit of  in fiscal operating loss as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to the operating profit as a percentage of sales of in fiscal income tax benefit in fiscal totaled  or of pretax losses  which compares with income tax expense of  or of pretax profits  in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of transactions involving the early sale of stock resulting from the exercise of incentive stock options by former employees of firefly renamed zygo teraoptix  and changes in the valuation for certain state tax carryforwards 
the company recorded a net loss for fiscal year of  or 
loss per share  as compared to a net profit of  or 
on a diluted per share basis  during fiscal excluding the gain on sale of the automation systems group in longmont  colorado of  and related exit costs  inventory write downs  and tax expense  the net loss was  or 
on a diluted per share basis  for fiscal year the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  basic shares and  fully diluted shares for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in the number of shares outstanding was primarily due to the  shares issued in march in the secondary offering of the company s common stock 
backlog at june  was  a decrease of  or  as compared to  excluding backlog from the automation systems group in longmont  colorado at june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of  or  in the semiconductor segment   or  in the industrial segment  and  or  in the telecommunications segment 
orders  net of debookings  for the fiscal year ended june  totaled  including  related to the automation systems group in longmont  colorado and consisted of  or  in the semiconductor segment   or  in the industrial segment  and  or  in the telecommunications segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of  for fiscal increased by  or  from fiscal net sales of  the significant increase in sales was due to increased demand from key markets  specifically increased sales and market share in stage metrology  optical metrology  and macro optics products 
for fiscal  net sales in the semiconductor segment were  or  net sales in the industrial segment were  or  and net sales in the telecommunications segment were  or 
company sales to the americas  primarily the united states  amounted to  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal levels of  the company s sales to outside the americas amounted to  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal levels of  sales to japan during fiscal amounted to  an increase of  or  from fiscal sales levels 
japan sales reached record levels driven by demand for stage metrology  metrology instrumentation components and systems  and semiconductor and optical storage 
sales to europe other  primarily europe  amounted to  an increase of  or  from fiscal due to increased sales in the industrial and semiconductor markets driven by the first full year of operations of the zygolot joint venture 
sales to the pacific rim  excluding japan  amounted to  a decrease of  or  from sales levels due to reductions in sales in the semiconductor and industrial markets 
substantially all of the company s sales and costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact the sales of the company s products in its export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
the impact of such changes in foreign currency values on the company s sales cannot be measured 
gross profit in fiscal amounted to  an increase of  or  from gross profit of  in fiscal excluding fiscal nonrecurring charges of  gross profit for fiscal increased  or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal excluding nonrecurring charges  fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 
on a comparable basis  excluding nonrecurring charges for fiscal  the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the increase in volume and higher productivity resulting from investments in equipment and manufacturing process enhancements 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal amounted to  an increase of  or  from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a has remained relatively constant at approximately 
the increase in fiscal resulted from increased commissions and incentive compensation costs resulting from higher sales and profit and increased administrative costs due to one new location that opened during the year  three locations which opened last fiscal year that now have been operating for a full year  and higher professional fees 
during fiscal  the company recorded a  credit to sg a as a result of a legal settlement 
research  development and engineering expenses r d in fiscal totaled  and increased by  or 
excluding fiscal nonrecurring charges of  fiscal r d costs increased  or 
r d as a percentage of net sales has remained relatively constant at approximately 
the company continues to invest in technology to enhance its position in the marketplace 
r d was driven by investments in next generation lithography product requirements and investments to broaden our customer base into automotive and telecommunications 
the company did not record any nonrecurring charges in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges in the amount of  in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges of  as a result of the acquisition of firefly technologies  inc  which became zygo teraoptix  inc 
zygo teraoptix 
the nonrecurring charge from the acquisition consisted of  for compensation expense resulting from the difference in the firefly stock option exercise price and the deemed fair market value on the date of grant for financial statement purposes and  for the payment of professional fees related to the transaction 
in  the company recorded a charge of  as a result of its reorganization of its west coast operations  principally for the write off of goodwill and inventory 
amortization expense of  for fiscal decreased by  or  from fiscal levels of  substantially all of the decrease is associated with the west coast operations write off of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal the company s operating profit in fiscal was  an increase of  from the operating loss of  excluding fiscal nonrecurring charges of  operating profit for fiscal increased  operating profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to the operating loss as a percentage of sales of in fiscal excluding nonrecurring charges  fiscal operating profit as a percentage of sales was 
income tax expense in fiscal totaled  or of pretax profits  which compares with income tax benefit of  or of pretax losses  in fiscal the effective tax rate of versus the combined federal and state statutory rate of in fiscal is primarily due to the impact of transactions involving the early sale of stock resulting from the exercise of incentive stock options by former employees of firefly renamed zygo teraoptix 
the effective tax rate of versus the combined statutory rate of in fiscal was primarily due to the tax benefits related to expenses that could not be recorded as a charge to earnings for financial statement purposes associated with the compensation charge in connection with the firefly acquisition 
the company recorded net earnings for fiscal year of  or 
on a diluted per share basis  as compared to a net loss of  or loss per share  during fiscal excluding nonrecurring charges for fiscal year  net earnings were  or 
on a diluted per share basis 
the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding at june  was  an increase of  as compared to  at june  the increase is due to the shares related to the secondary offering and the impact of stock options offset by the repurchase of shares from two officers and directors 
backlog at june  was  an increase of  or  as compared to  at june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of  or  in the semiconductor segment   or  in the industrial segment  and  or  in the telecommunications segment 
the backlog decreased  between the third and fourth quarters due to the slowdown in the semiconductor and telecommunications markets 
orders for fourth quarter fiscal totaled  and consisted of  or  in the semiconductor segment   or  in the industrial segment  and net debooking of  or  in the telecommunications segment 
the net debooking in the telecommunications segment was primarily due to cancellations of orders totaling  from two major customers due to market conditions 
liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was  a decrease of  from the  at june  the company maintained cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities excluding restricted cash of  at june  totaling  a decrease of  from june  excluding the cash received from the sale of the automation systems group of  net of escrow of  there would have been a decrease of  during the year ended june  marketable securities are invested primarily in securities with maturity dates ranging from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in working capital was due to the operating loss  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and progress payments  and investments in property  plant  and equipment  partially offset by a decrease in receivables in all cases  after excluding the automation systems group assets and liabilities from the june  balance sheet which were transferred to brooks automation  inc 
the decrease in accrued expenses was due to payments of profit sharing and other incentive compensation liabilities that existed at june  due to the current year net loss  similar liabilities did not exist as of june  the investments in property  plant  and equipment are primarily due to investments in optical equipment  and the completion of the teraoptix facility in westborough  massachusetts 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the company s  bank line of credit at fiscal year end stockholders equity at june  decreased by  from the year earlier to  primarily due to net loss 
the company incurred significant losses from its telecommunications segment and there is very little visibility as to when a healthy telecommunications market will occur 
management is reviewing various options to reduce the effect of its ongoing negative impact on the financial results 
the company s short term liquidity at june  was adequate for its requirements and the company expects that available cash and its existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements over the near term 
risk factors that may impact future results industry concentration and cyclicality zygo s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures and component requirements for manufacturers in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
these industries are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by us 
for the foreseeable future  our operations will continue to be dependent on the capital expenditures in these industries which  in turn  is largely dependent on the market demand in the semiconductor  industrial  and telecommunications markets 
the overall economy continues to be in a low growth period  which could have a significant impact on the company s near term financial results  as customer demand remains stagnant 
during the fourth quarter of  the company showed a slight increase in orders over the average of the previous three quarters 
the increase was due to an increase in the industrial segment 
the semiconductor and telecommunications segments continue to be adversely affected by the current economic conditions 
zygo s net sales and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if downturns or slowdowns in the markets in which we serve extend significantly into the future 
risks associated with acquisitions zygo s growth strategy includes expanding our products and services  and we may seek acquisitions to expand our business 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products complementary to our business and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including some or all of the following substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of certain intangible assets  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  the inability to manage the growth expected for various acquisitions  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies in the process of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds  and combining different corporate cultures 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in long term benefits to us or that our management will be able to effectively manage the acquired businesses 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business may require substantial capital investment 
we may not have the necessary funds nor may they be readily available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
manufacturing capacity we have recently built and financed a new facility in westborough  massachusetts for our zygo teraoptix operation  providing us with significantly more micro optics manufacturing capacity 
to the extent our micro optics business continues to not grow as quickly as we had expected  our new manufacturing facility might in part represent excess capacity for which we may not recover the cost 
in that circumstance  our revenues may be inadequate to support our committed costs and our planned growth  and our profitability and business results would suffer 
customer concentration  relationship with canon during fiscal   and  sales to canon inc and canon sales co  inc collectively  canon  zygo s largest customer in those periods  accounted for   and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that sales to canon  an original investor in zygo which owns approximately of zygo s outstanding shares of common stock and is a distributor of certain zygo products in the japanese market  will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our customers generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase zygo s products 
a reduction or delay in orders from this customer  including reductions or delays due to market  economic  or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve  could have a material adverse effect upon zygo s results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations zygo s quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as the effect of our acquisitions and consequent integration  the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  our ability to develop innovative products  the timing of new product releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of our products  changes in our and our competitors pricing policies  budgeting cycles of our customers  changes in operating expenses and personnel changes  changes in our business strategy  and general economic factors 
due to these and other factors we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
in future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole or of capital expenditures in the semiconductor  industrial and telecommunications markets 
because all of the components of the company s budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of spending within these markets  the prevailing economic uncertainty renders estimates of future revenue and expenses even more difficult than usual to make 
possible volatility of stock price zygo believes that factors such as the announcement of new products or technologies by zygo or our competitors  market conditions in the semiconductor  industrial  and telecommunications markets  and quarterly fluctuations in financial results are expected to cause the market price of the common stock to vary substantially 
further  our net sales or results of operations in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely decline 
in addition  historically the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market volatility may adversely affect the market price of the shares of zygo s common stock 
competition zygo faces competition from a number of companies in all its markets  some of which have greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological  and personnel resources 
in addition  we compete with the internal development efforts of our current and prospective customers  some of which may attempt to become vertically integrated 
zygo s competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may necessitate price reductions  which can adversely affect results of operations 
although we believe that we have certain technical and other advantages over some of our competitors  maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by zygo in research and development and sales  marketing  and service 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the bases of competition in the industries in which zygo competes will not shift 
technological change and new product development the market for zygo s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards  respond to changes in customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
zygo commits significant financial and personnel resources on a continuous basis to redesign and enhance its instruments  systems  and components and upgrade its proprietary software technology incorporated in its products 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on zygo s business and impact our close relationships with customers 
this could have an impact on customers willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to such information  that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or product and service enhancements on a timely basis  or respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in addition  there can be no assurance the new products and services or product enhancements  if any  developed by zygo will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on proprietary technology zygo s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology by third parties or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws of the united states 
in addition  there remains the possibility that others will reverse engineer our products in order to determine their method of operation and introduce competing products or that others will develop competing technology independently 
any such adverse circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation for financial gain that is based on patents with broad  and often questionable  application 
as the number of our products increase  the markets in which our products are sold expands  and the functionality of those products grows and overlaps with products offered by competitors  we believe that zygo may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
although we do not believe any of our products or proprietary rights infringe the rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against zygo in the future or that any such claim will not result in costly litigation or require us to enter into royalty arrangements  which may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
dependence on key personnel zygo s success depends in large part upon the continued services of many of our highly skilled personnel involved in management  research  development and engineering  sales and marketing  manufacturing  and support and upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified employees 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
competition for these individuals from a variety of employers  including our competitors and companies in computer or technology related industries  is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract and retain additional personnel 
dependence on third party suppliers zygo is dependent on suppliers for raw materials and various electrical  mechanical  and optical supplies  including fiber and electronic components and modules 
if any relationship with a key supplier is terminated or if a supplier fails or is unable to provide reliable services or equipment and we are unable to reach suitable alternative solutions quickly  we may experience significant delays and additional costs in the manufacturing of our products 
if our key suppliers cease manufacturing the supplies we require  if their manufacturing operations are interrupted for any significant amount of time  or if they are unwilling to supply us for any other reason  including capacity restraints  then we may be at least temporarily unable to obtain these supplies  thus exposing us to significant delays and additional costs 
currently there are only a limited number of companies that are capable of supplying optical materials in the quantity and of the quality we require 
although we enter  either directly or through our contract manufacturers  into purchase orders with our suppliers based on our forecasts  we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
moreover  as our demand for supplies increases  we may not be able to obtain these supplies in a timely manner 
if we are unable to obtain  either directly or through contract manufacturers  a sufficient amount of supplies  or if we experience any interruption in delivery of supplies  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative supplies 
revenues derived from international sales and foreign operations we sell our products internationally  primarily to customers in japan and throughout the pacific rim 
net sales to customers outside the americas primarily the united states accounted for   and of our net sales in each of the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively  and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
international sales and foreign operations are subject to inherent risks  including the economic conditions in these various foreign countries and their trading partners  political instability  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  compliance with foreign laws  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other barriers  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  staffing and managing foreign operations  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations  transportation delays  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
substantially all zygo s sales and costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
however  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive to the extent locally produced alternative products are available 
such conditions could negatively impact international sales of our products and foreign operations  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
there can be no assurance that risks inherent in international sales and foreign operations will not have a material adverse effect on zygo in the future 
backlog zygo schedules the production of its systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog will ultimately result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales could adversely affect our results of operations 
the company has recently experienced a significant decrease in backlog primarily due to the slowdown in the semiconductor and telecommunications markets  and net debookings in the telecommunications segment  primarily due to order cancellations 
sales cycle zygo s lengthy and variable qualification and sales cycle makes it difficult to predict the timing of a sale or whether a sale will be made  which may cause us to have excess manufacturing capacity or inventory and negatively impact our operating results 
as is typical in the industry  our customers generally expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our products and manufacturing process 
this evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three to six months and sometimes longer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales  marketing and research and development expenses  expend significant management efforts  increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead time supplies prior to receiving an order 
even after this evaluation process  it is possible that a potential customer will not purchase our products 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to unplanned processing and other delays  particularly with respect to larger customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchase activity 
if we increase capacity and order supplies in anticipation of an order that does not materialize  our gross margins will decline and we will have to carry or write off excess inventory 
even if we receive an order  the additional manufacturing capacity that we add to service the customer s requirements may be underutilized in a subsequent quarter 
either situation could cause our results of operations to be below the expectations of investors and public market analysts  which would  in turn  cause the price of our stock to decline 
our long sales cycles  as well as the practice of companies in the telecommunications industry to sporadically place large orders with short lead times  may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
prediction of manufacturing requirements if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales 
we currently use a rolling month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and  in the telecommunications field  our limited product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms  and demand for each component at a given time 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales 
if we overestimate our requirements  we could have excess inventory of parts 
we also may experience shortages of components from time to time  which also could delay the manufacturing of our products and could cause us to lose orders or customers 
undetected product defects zygo s products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects that are not detected until after our products have been installed  which could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
we design some of our products for deployment in large and complex optical networks 
because of the nature of these products  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our fiber optic products may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released  and our customers may discover defects in our products only after they have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these conditions increase the risk that we could experience  among other things loss of customers  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could cause us to experience losses  incur liabilities  and cause our net sales to decline 
environmental regulations environmental regulations applicable to zygo s manufacturing operations could limit our ability to expand or subject us to substantial costs 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to comply with present and future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including money market funds  commercial paper  government agency securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income on our variable rate investments is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that a material risk exposure exists

the impact of such changes in foreign currency values on the company s sales cannot be measured
