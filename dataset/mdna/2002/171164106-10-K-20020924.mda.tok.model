item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business we are a distributor of prescription drugs for people with certain chronic health conditions 
we consider our business to be unique and refer to it as specialty pharmacy 
we serve patients with highly specialized pharmaceutical needs and help employers and third party payors manage patient care costs 
we distribute pharmaceuticals and provide specialized patient management services nationwide for people with chronic conditions including hiv aids  organ transplants  and diseases treated with biotech injectable medications 
we work directly with patients  physicians  healthcare providers  insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  government agencies  and other third party payors to improve clinical and financial outcomes for patients with chronic  complex  and expensive pharmaceutical needs 
we are comprised of two operating segments mail order and retail 
the mail order segment includes the biotech injectables program  organ transplant medications  and home service medical the home service medical business was sold as of september  see note  notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the retail segment focuses on hiv aids  organ transplant medications  and certain biotech injectables through the statscript specialty pharmacy stores 
during fiscal year  we disposed of or shut down certain lines of business together  the disposed businesses 
within the mail order segment  we sold the home service medical hsm business and closed the diabetes service centers in the first quarter of fiscal within the retail segment  the remaining clinical partners business ceased operations in the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note  notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time prescriptions are dispensed by the pharmacist and shipped to or picked up by the patient 
we participate in various third party provider networks and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of these networks  the amount to be paid for our products is determined or adjudicated through electronic connections with these networks at the time of sale 
however  for certain third party providers and state medicaid programs for which there is no electronic adjudication process available at the time of sale  we determine an appropriate estimate for expected payor discount 
revenue is then reported at the estimated net realizable amount and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
although management continually monitors its assumptions used in estimating payor discounts  such subsequent adjustments could be favorable or unfavorable to future periods 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  prescription benefits managers  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of accounts by payor type  and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
goodwill we have million of goodwill on our balance sheet at june   related to acquisitions 
the periodic assessment of the valuation of these assets involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we will also review the carrying value of these assets whenever there are any events or circumstances that indicate the potential for impairment 
if an impairment is determined  the carrying values of these assets will be reduced to fair value

net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations revenue total revenue for fiscal was up to million from million in fiscal  reflecting strong existing business as well as full year revenues from three acquisitions in the second half of fiscal  which  together will be referred to as the acquired businesses 
our existing business and the acquired businesses together will be referred to as the on going business 
the acquired businesses include four retail pharmacies of american prescription providers app acquired in february  and a single location pharmacy in sherman oaks  california oaks acquired in april  in the retail segment  and the organ transplant pharmacy of sangstat medical sangstat acquired in april  in the mail order segment 
overall  these three acquisitions contributed approximately million or of our million year over year growth excluding the disposed businesses  as noted below 
during fiscal year  we disposed of or shut down certain lines of business together  the disposed businesses 
within the mail order segment  the hsm business was sold and the diabetes service centers were closed in the first quarter of fiscal year within the retail segment  the remaining clinical partners business ceased operation in the second quarter of fiscal by revenue source  fiscal compares to fiscal as follows in thousands fiscal year change mail order segment on going business   disposed businesses 
 total mail order   retail segment on going business   disposed businesses 
total retail   total company   the mail order segment revenue grew year over year  despite the september  sale of the segment s hsm business and the closure of its diabetes service centers 
excluding these businesses in both years  the year over year growth was 
this growth was due to several factors  including the addition of new biotech injectable patients from several payors  the april  sangstat acquisition  and price inflation 
the sangstat acquisition contributed approximately million of the growth in year over year revenue 
excluding the sangstat acquisition  the rate of revenue growth slowed to approximately in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  due to new patients from the contract with aetna that became effective july   unfavorable retention of organ transplant patients  and product shortages for enbrel and the hepatitis c drug peg intron 
payor reimbursements from aetna represented and of our mail order revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
except for aetna  no other private payor accounts for or more of our revenues in fiscal years and the retail segment revenue grew for the year due to continued additions of new patients at existing stores and the full year benefit of the acquisition of the app and oaks specialty pharmacies 
the newly acquired stores accounted for approximately million of our growth in the on going business  while same store revenue accounted for the remainder of the revenue growth  with a increase for the year 
the same store growth was due to a combination of increased anti viral medication volume bolstered by increased post transplant drug sales 
we plan to continue our expansion of retail product offerings beyond our hiv aids focus  to include post transplant and hepatitis c medications 
a single private payor represented approximately and of our on going retail revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross profit total gross profit dollars increased million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margins as a percentage of revenue remained unchanged at in fiscal and fiscal mail order margins as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from the year ago period due to a stabilization in pricing pressures in markets we serve  improved purchasing programs  and a change in product mix toward higher margin products 
aetna represented and of our mail order margins for fiscal years and  respectively 
retail margins as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly from the year ago period primarily due to the closing of selected geographic markets or store locations and a large payor s decision to reduce reimbursement in the middle of fiscal year a single private payor represented and of our retail margins for fiscal years and  respectively 
we anticipate that payors will continue to exert downward pressure on the prices we will be able to charge as payors continue to seek containment of healthcare costs  which will negatively affect margins in the future 
we are working to offset this pricing pressure in a number of ways  including sales and marketing efforts to direct more profitable medications into both the retail and mail order segments  enhanced programs with manufacturers  wholesalers  and group purchasing organizations to reduce product costs  and a store by store focus on payor and drug mix to improve gross margins 
operating expenses our operating expenses include selling and marketing  general and administrative g a  and bad debt expenses 
our g a expenses include both corporate g a expenses corporate management  information systems  accounting  human resources and direct segment g a expenses division management  customer service  billing  pharmacy fulfillment 
our business model for operating expenses is to continue to improve efficiency on greater volume 
selling and marketing expenses the following chart shows the year to year comparisons of selling and marketing expenses 
in thousands fiscal year change on going business   disposed businesses total company   our selling and marketing expenses increased million  or in fiscal our selling and marketing expenses for on going business increased million  or in fiscal  from million to million 
these marketing expenses for on going business represented and of revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase in expenses is primarily due to head count additions and increased travel and promotion activities 
we operate a consolidated selling and marketing organization serving both the mail order and retail segments 
we believe this integrated approach increases the effectiveness of our selling and marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses the following chart shows the year to year comparisons of general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt expense 
in thousands fiscal year change on going business   disposed businesses total company   our general and administrative expenses increased million  or in fiscal  due primarily to retail store acquisitions in the latter part of fiscal and higher lease and pharmacist operating costs in existing specialty pharmacy stores 
for our on going business  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in fiscal  from million to million  and declined as a percentage of total revenue from to reflecting our emphasis on operating leverage against increasing revenues 
we expect to see continued operating leverage in this area in the future 
included in fiscal general and administrative expenses was million of goodwill amortization that was not expensed in fiscal as a result of our adoption of statement see new accounting pronouncements included in this item in addition  fiscal included charges of million related to the statscript retail business for the costs of transferring the kansas city retail headquarters to minneapolis  store closing costs  and costs associated with the fiscal financial restatement 
excluding these charges and the disposed businesses  fiscal year and general and administrative expenses were million and million  or and of revenues  respectively 
bad debt expenses our bad debt expense decreased million  or in fiscal bad debt expenses represented and of revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this high rate of bad debt expense in was due primarily to a higher write off of receivables in the retail segment 
the bad debt experience in fiscal year reflects our consolidation of billing and collection operations to our minneapolis headquarters and related process improvements 
fiscal results are representative of our expectation for future bad debt expense of approximately of revenue 
interest income interest income  net of interest expense  decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting our invested asset levels and declining interest rate environment  net of short term borrowing costs on our line of credit 
included in interest income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively  of interest on a note receivable with the buyer of our hsm business in september this note has been paid in full and as a result will not be generating interest income in fiscal other income loss other income of million in fiscal reflects primarily a million gain on the collection of a previously reserved note receivable due from the buyer of our hsm business 
the million loss in fiscal reflects our loss on sale of available for sale securities that had been received as consideration in the sale of our medgenesis business 
income taxes in fiscal and the income tax expense benefit was calculated on rates of and  respectively 
see note  notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to our statutory rate 
looking forward  we expect our combined federal and state tax rate to approximate 
fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations revenue total revenue for fiscal was up to million from million in fiscal  reflecting strong existing business growth as well as growth from three acquisitions in the second half of the year  which together will be referred to as the acquired businesses 
the existing business and the acquired businesses together will be referred to as the on going business 
the acquired businesses include four retail pharmacies of american prescription providers app acquired in february  and a single location pharmacy in sherman oaks  california oaks acquired in april  in the retail segment  and the organ transplant pharmacy of sangstat medical sangstat acquired in april  in the mail order segment 
overall  these three acquisitions contributed one fourth million of the company s million year on year growth excluding the disposed businesses  as noted below

excluding these businesses in both years  the year on year growth was 
this growth was driven primarily by the addition of new patients from the biotech injectables contract with aetna that became effective july  the sangstat acquisition in april strengthened our position in the transplant market and contributed approximately million in fourth quarter revenue 
the retail segment grew for the year due to continued additions of new patients at existing stores and the acquisition of the app and oaks specialty pharmacies 
the newly acquired stores accounted for approximately one half of the fiscal year growth in the on going business  while same store revenue accounted for the remainder of the revenue growth  with approximately a increase for the year 
the retail segment faced significant reimbursement pressure in fiscal  which lowered the revenue growth rate and reduced gross margins 
cost of revenue and gross profit total gross profit dollars decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margins as a percentage of revenue declined percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal however  exclusive of the disposed businesses  higher revenue led to a gross profit dollar increase of million  from million in fiscal to million in  while margins declined percentage points  from to in the respective years 
mail order margins as a percentage of sales declined slightly due to a change in product mix toward lower margin products  a continuing supply shortage of a high margin product beginning in january   and lower than average reimbursement rates under our contract with aetna 
two primary factors contributed to a significant decline in retail margins 
first  a large uncontracted payor significantly reduced its reimbursement schedule  which caused an approximate two percentage point decrease in the segment s margins 
second  continued pricing pressures from other payors at existing stores lowered the overall segment margins by an additional two percentage points

the decline is attributed primarily to the cost of our pursuit of strategic alternatives in the first three quarters of fiscal million and certain costs incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the contemplated spin off of the medgenesis diagnostic products business million 
we incurred no such related costs in fiscal aside from these items  corporate g a expenses increased  a favorable comparison against a reported increase in revenue 
mail order segment general and administrative expense grew  from million to million

liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million of working capital  compared to million as of june  during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
the average days sales outstanding dso of our accounts receivable improved from days at june   to days at june  faster payment from our larger payors and active collection efforts led to this improvement 
despite this improvement in dso  we used million in cash to finance our receivable growth resulting from increasing revenues 
we expect our receivables to perform at or better than days sales outstanding in fiscal the average days inventory on hand also improved from days at june   to days at june  this improvement resulted in a million source of cash during fiscal we expect our inventory to perform at or below days on hand in fiscal during fiscal  we collected approximately million in income tax refunds resulting from prior years tax losses 
approximately million of cash was provided by investing activities during fiscal  consisting of million from the collection of a note from the buyer of our hsm business  offset by million cash used for the purchases of property and equipment  primarily leasehold improvements for the statscript specialty pharmacies

we are in compliance with the debt covenants of the line of credit as of june  under the terms of the agreement  the debt is secured by receivables and inventory and bears interest at prime rate 
the line of credit expires in january  we are currently in the process of securing a new  long term line of credit agreement  which we expect to complete by december  there were no short term borrowings outstanding under our line of credit at june  we believe that the line of credit and cash provided by operating activities should allow us to meet foreseeable cash requirements and provide the flexibility to fund future working capital growth 
however  we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing beyond our current million line of credit to fund any major business acquisitions or capital spending projects 
we are not currently planning any major capital projects beyond our normal requirements of to million per year

new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  business combinations  which prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  defines the methodology to be used in measuring goodwill and other intangible assets  and defines certain disclosure requirements for business combinations 
statement became effective for all transactions initiated after june   and for all purchase method transactions completed after june  accordingly  we adopted statement beginning july   resulting in no material effect to the financial statements 
on that same date  the fasb also issued statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer being amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules beginning in our first fiscal quarter of that began on june  application of the non amortization provisions of the statement resulted in a decrease of approximately million in amortization of existing goodwill and an increase in after tax net income of approximately million per share in fiscal in fiscal  goodwill amortization totaled million  which would have amounted to after tax net income of million or per share 
during fiscal  we performed periodic impairment tests of goodwill beginning june   resulting in no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill 
in october  the fasb issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement  which replaces statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
statement also broadens disposal transaction reporting related to discontinued operations 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt statement in fiscal and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
prior guidance required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  impact of inflation changes in prices charged by biopharmaceutical manufacturers for the drugs we dispense  along with increasing labor costs  freight and supply costs and other overhead expenses  affect our cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have been able to pass a portion of the effect of such increases to the payor and patient pursuant to automatic price adjustments made under our payor contracts 
as a result  changes due to inflation have not had significant adverse effects on our operations
