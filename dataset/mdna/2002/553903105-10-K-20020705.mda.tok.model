this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
restructuring we are continuing to implement our restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating expenses 
over the past two years  we have reduced our workforce headcount by approximately and have recently shut down our facilities in sunnyvale  california  boston  massachusetts  austin  texas  denver  colorado  florida and north carolina 
we have begun the process  which we expect to complete by the second quarter of fiscal  of consolidating all manufacturing and assembly operations into our facility in dublin  ireland 
we also anticipate reducing the amount of space leased for our corporate headquarters after our anaheim lease expires in january as part of the restructuring  we plan to emphasize our expertise in the design  deployment and servicing of integrated solutions for the enterprise storage marketplace 
we anticipate changing our product sales mix away from proprietary products to integrated products  such as vivant  an ibm mylex based product 
we also anticipate selling a higher proportion of non mti branded products 
although we expect to continue to develop and manufacture proprietary products  we plan to do so at significantly reduced levels  including lower research and development expenditures 
the transition to integrated products is expected to have a negative impact on our gross margins 
the primary goal of the restructuring is to reduce costs 
we believe the restructuring may have other benefits as well  including the ability to offer a wider range of products  greater flexibility in designing solutions for our customers  and the ability to react more quickly to changing technologies 
we face significant risks and uncertainties in connection with the restructuring and we have incurred substantial charges in connection with the restructuring  described below 
despite the restructuring activities that have taken place to date  we have continued to incur recurring losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring will be successful or that the anticipated cost savings will be realized 
please see risk factors for additional risks related to the restructuring 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements 

table of contents we based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales of our equipment are recorded upon shipment  net of an allowance for estimated returns  as long as no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount is determinable 
product sales are not contingent upon customer testing  approval and or acceptance 
revenue from equipment maintenance contracts is recorded as deferred income when billed and is recognized as earned over the period in which the services are provided  primarily straight line over the term of the contract 
we accrue for warranty expense at the time revenue is recognized and maintain a warranty accrual for the estimated future warranty obligation based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated warranty costs and sales volumes 
we apply statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses  provided the software has been delivered to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price charged to the customer is fixed or determinable at fair value and there are no significant obligations on our part related to the sale and the resulting receivable is deemed collectible  net of an allowance for returns  cancellations and maintenance  including vendor and post contract support obligations 
revenue from maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue from consulting and other software related services is recognized as the services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we apply statement  accounting for income taxes  under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  net of a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as management has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
upon the adoption of statement no 
in fiscal  the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was determined to not be impaired 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within this analysis could produce significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  net of an allowance for obsolete  slow moving  and unsalable inventory 
the allowance is based upon management s review of inventories on hand  historical product sales  and forecasts 
we use rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component and product inventory requirements 
lead times for products  materials and components that we order may vary significantly and depend upon factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand 
as a result  our product and component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our product or component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which could lead to additional excess and obsolete charges 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charges operating income loss other income  net equity in net loss of affiliate loss on foreign currency transactions income tax expense benefit net income loss net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was the result of decreased revenue of million  million and million from server products  tape libraries and software products  respectively 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume  mainly from the decrease in sales of our proprietary products resulting from the global economic slowdown and our inability to penetrate global customers 
increased competition has also contributed to the decline in revenue 
our business is greatly affected by general economic and business conditions 
continued softness in the information technology market in both the united states and in europe and consumers uncertainty about the global economic condition could result in further reduced demand for our products and services 
as a result of the weakened global economy  consumers are postponing or reducing expenditures  causing our revenue  our operating results and our financial condition to decline 
the downturn also has led to restructuring actions such as  but not limited to  the relocation of manufacturing activities  complete or partial abandonment of underutilized facilities  headcount reduction  fixed asset write offs and inventory write offs 
as a result  we are shifting to integrated third party products 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and thus  our operating results 

table of contents net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of decreased revenues of million and million from server products and software products  respectively 
server products revenues in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal we transitioned our sales focus during fiscal towards our proprietary products and away from our third party resale products 
as a result of this transition  we increased our sales efforts with irbs 
however  during fiscal  because of the lack of liquidity and resulting higher risk of success of the irbs  we experienced a decrease in demand for our proprietary products from irbs 
we elected to pursue sales to fortune and global customers 
these customers typically have a longer procurement cycle  which adversely affected net product revenue during fiscal year moreover  the secondary effect of the many irb collapses affected our ability to grow revenues 
furthermore  a weakening economy resulted in a decreasing demand for the information storage systems  software and services 
service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to our inability to fully offset lost revenue from maintenance contract that expired with revenue from renewed and new maintenance contracts 
the lower number of renewals is attributable to the loss of customers to competitors during the fiscal year 
due to concerns about our financial position  existing customers may be more reluctant to renew their maintenance contracts 
service revenue was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year increased revenue from maintenance contracts for increased field population was the main cause of this increase 
product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to additional inventory reserves of million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which consisted primarily of additional reserves for gladiator  and inventories 
furthermore  increased pricing competition and reduced manufacturing efficiencies resulting from lower production volumes as well as changes in product mix contributed to the lower product gross margin 
although our restructuring activities are designed to lower our cost structure and increase product gross profit at lower production volumes  there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful 
in addition  product gross profit may decline further in connection with our shift to integrated third party products  as we may face increased pricing competition for such products from a greater number of competitors selling the same third party products 
product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease resulted from a domestic increase in revenue concentration from back up products  which historically carry a significantly lower margin than our proprietary storage products 
this decrease was partly offset by a european increase in revenue concentration from proprietary products  primarily vivant 
also  lower operating volumes caused a significant decrease in our ability to absorb our manufacturing overhead  which reduced our product gross margin 
service gross profit service gross profit for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in service gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased infrastructure costs resulting from reduced manpower  mandatory pay cuts  mandatory vacations  and cost control on travel related expenses 
service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in service gross profit was primarily attributable to increased employment costs from the hiring of additional staff anticipated for service offerings 
we expected the number of installed vivant units to increase in fiscal year over fiscal levels 
during the first nine months of fiscal year  we hired more service and support staff 
we were upgrading the skills of our staff to support the increased volume of proprietary product and service offerings 
as a result  service cost of revenue increased in fiscal year this cost did not continue to increase in fiscal year because we now have sufficient field service staff 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to substantial reduction in salary and benefit expenses by million which resulted from reduced headcounts  elimination of amortization of goodwill of million  reduction in bad debt expense by million  reduction in communication and freight charges by million  reduction in marketing and promotional expenses by million  reduction in professional and consulting fees by million  and reduction in travel and lodging expenses by million 
please see critical accounting policies for greater detail regarding goodwill accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase was because of bad debt expense of million  primarily as a result of internet related customer non payments  and a million charge to write down goodwill related to the purchase of certain product lines from raxco  inc there were other expenses of 
million in legal 
these increases were partly offset by lower salary  commission and bonus expense of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to headcount reductions  substantially lower project costs  reduced travel and lodging expenses and consulting fees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we abandoned our under utilized research and development facility in sunnyvale  california  and consolidated our research and development activities in the anaheim  california and westmont  illinois facilities 
pursuant to the restructuring  we plan to devote fewer resources developing proprietary products and plan to consolidate our operations to avoid redundancy at the two facilities  with the westmont facility serving as our interoperability center while the anaheim center will become our sustaining and software development facility 
as a result  research and development expenses are expected to continue to decrease in fiscal year research and development expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year this increase was primarily for increased development costs associated with hiring more staff to complete expansion of the vivant product line at the high end and also to expand our reach to the mid range product line 
restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which consisted of million  million and million charges related to abandonment of either underutilized or historically unprofitable facilities  headcount reduction of employees or  and disposal of fixed assets  respectively 
of the employees terminated      and were from sales  marketing  general and administrative  field services  research and development and manufacturing departments  respectively 
the expected cash impact of the restructuring charge is million  related to severance  of which million was paid in fiscal year the remaining million will be paid in fiscal year we are attempting to complete transitioning our manufacturing facility to dublin  ireland by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year in order to further reduce expenses  in june  we approved additional restructuring actions such as  but not limited to  additional facility and headcount reductions in the first half of fiscal year as a result of the restructuring  we expect to reduce our domestic and european quarterly expense run rate by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  there can be no assurance that our expenses will be reduced to this extent 
the amount accrued for the fourth quarter fiscal year restructuring activities as of april   was as follows in millions abandoned facilities workforce reduction total during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we included a charge of million for severance in operating expenses 
of this charge  million and million were paid during fiscal year and fiscal 
table of contents year  respectively 
the restructuring included an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by employees or 
as a result of the restructuring  we realized quarterly expense savings of million beginning in the second quarter of fiscal other income  net other income  net in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to decreased income from emc as we received the last payment for a patent sale in fiscal  coupled with a decrease in interest expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a favorable sales tax refund of million in fiscal year other income  net in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase was primarily from increased interest income and decreased interest expense in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this was a result of increased average cash balance during the year and eliminated credit line balances 
equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents our proportionate share of caldera s net losses and amortization of the goodwill related to the investment made in caldera in august the original investment in caldera was million and included a cash payment of million  b note payable of million bearing interest at the prime rate plus one percent per annum and payable in two equal semi annual payments beginning february and c investment costs of million  including the issuance of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the excess of the our investment in caldera over the related underlying equity in net assets of million was being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
however  we adopted statement as of april   the beginning of fiscal year  and therefore  ceased to amortize the remaining balance of goodwill related to the investment in caldera of million  which was written off during the third quarter of fiscal year due to an other than temporary decline in value and recognizing our proportional of share of caldera s net loss 
such loss has been included in equity in net loss of affiliate in our fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes we recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  million related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year because of the continued decline in the market value of our investment in caldera and continued softness in the domestic and european markets for our products  management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets existing on april  we recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax benefit of million in fiscal year the increase was primarily because of the recording of a net million expense related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the net million tax expense was partly offset by million of tax benefit recorded in the first three quarters of fiscal year our management believed  at the time base on our historical profitability  that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefits of the net deferred tax asset existing at april  based on projected financial results and available tax planning strategies  including the realizable value of our caldera investment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at april  and april   respectively  which was a decrease of million 
net operating activities used cash of million in fiscal year  an increase in cash used of million as compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the net loss of million which resulted from decreased revenues and margins 
the net loss was partially offset by non cash expenses of million and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net investing activities used cash of million primarily as a result of capital equipment purchases 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily because of borrowings from canopy of million  the exercise of stock options and the issuance of treasury shares  providing cash of million  offset by capital lease payments of million 

table of contents we have experienced recurring decreases in revenues and margins  which have resulted in significant losses and cash used in operations and have significantly reduced available working capital 
as of april   working capital was million  as compared to million at the end of the prior fiscal year 
in response  we have taken the following actions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented further restructuring activities see note  consisting primarily of a reduction in headcount and a complete or partial abandonment of under utilized facilities and fixed assets 
as a result  we expect to reduce our quarterly cash outlays by approximately million 
in june  the management approved additional restructuring activities such as  but not limited to  a reduction in headcount of approximately individuals domestically and consolidation of under utilized facilities  particularly exiting unused portions of the anaheim  california facility 
of the people     and are from sales  marketing  general and administration  research and development and manufacturing departments  respectively 
as a result  we will record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year and expect to reduce our quarterly cash outlay by million 
in february  we borrowed million from canopy  our largest stockholder 
on june   in response to limited borrowing ability  we replaced our million line of credit with silicon valley bank with a million revolving line of credit from canopy 
the outstanding million loan has been converted to borrowings against this line of credit 
the new line will mature on june   bearing an interest rate of nine percent per annum and will be secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the canopy loan agreement contains negative covenants placing certain restrictions on our ability to repurchase capital stock  pay dividends or make distributions  purchase or sell assets  incur liens on our assets  incur additional debt  merge with another entity  make loans or investments  amend our charter certificate of incorporation or bylaws or issue stock 
although we are currently in compliance with all of the terms of the canopy loan agreement  and believe that we will remain in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow under the canopy loan agreement 
canopy may terminate the canopy loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable upon an event of default  including upon days notice in the event that canopy in good faith deems its interest in mti to be insecure  the value of the collateral to have significantly declined  or the prospect of timely payment or performance to be impaired 
canopy owns approximately  shares  or  of our issued and outstanding common stock 
raymond noorda  chairman of mti  is also chairman of the canopy group and the beneficial owner of the majority interest in the canopy group 
we plan to undertake the following actions in the first half of fiscal sell our remaining shares of caldera corporation common stock 
we entered into an agreement on june   to sell our remaining shares to caldera and we expect to collect approximately million in net proceeds 
transition manufacturing from our anaheim  california headquarters to our dublin  ireland facility further consolidating our anaheim  california operations 
all excess fixed assets and inventory will be brokered or re deployed 
effective february   we entered into an agreement the emc agreement with emc corporation emc in which we sold to emc substantially all of our existing patents  patent applications and related rights 
we were entitled to receive million over the life of the emc agreement 
the final payment of million was received in january we also were entitled to receive royalty payments in the aggregate of up to a maximum of million over the term of the emc agreement 
as part of the maximum million in royalties  minimum royalties of million were to be received in five annual installments  beginning within thirty days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the emc agreement  and within thirty days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
as of march  we had received all such installments 
also  as a result of a computer and technology agreement between emc 
table of contents and ibm announced in march  the minimum royalties of million were to be increased to million 
payments were to be received under the emc agreement in five equal annual installments 
we received the first three annual installments in march  march and march  and are expecting to receive the two remaining annual installments of million in march and we believe that revenues and margins are at sustainable levels and working capital is adequate to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  revenues and margins continue to decrease  we may seek additional financing alternatives such as additional bank borrowings and or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
no assurance can be given that additional sources of financing will be available or that if available  such financing will be on terms favorable to us 
if additional sources of financing are not available  we intend to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
see risk factors we will need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations  and such additional financing may not be available 
the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of april  payments due by period total thereafter in millions note payable lease obligations recent accounting pronouncements the fasb recently issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations addressing financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
statement requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
statement also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and to depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on the results of our operations and financial position  but currently believe the impact will not be material 
on october   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement no 
statement retains many of the fundamental provisions of statement statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principle board opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will adopt statement in fiscal year the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
on april   the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement updates  clarifies and 
table of contents simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
statement rescinds statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in opinion will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
statement amended statement  and is no longer necessary because statement has been rescinded 
statement was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of transition to the provisions of the motor carrier act of because the transition has been completed  statement is no longer necessary 
statement amends statement to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
this amendment is consistent with the fasb s goal of requiring similar accounting treatment for transactions that have similar economic effects 
the company will adopt statement in fiscal statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
inflation and foreign currency exchange we recorded million in foreign exchange losses during fiscal year  which resulted from european currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we have used hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks  none of which were outstanding at april  there can be no assurance  however  that such actions successfully will reduce our exposure to financial market risks 
risk factors the non historical information in this form k constitute forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
the sections entitled risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business contain a discussion of some of the factors that could contribute to those differences 
factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
we cannot predict the long term impact of our recent restructuring and cost reduction activities 
we recently implemented restructuring activities in an effort to reduce costs 
these measures included reductions in our workforce and the elimination of certain under utilized facilities  including offices in sunnyvale  california  boston  massachusetts  austin  texas  denver  colorado  florida and north carolina 
we reduced the number of our full time employees from on april  to as of may  please see significant business developments restructuring 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing the restructuring 
the restructuring may fail to reduce expenses  fail to reduce expenses significantly enough or have other  unintended consequences  such as the loss of key employees  customers or a reduction of revenue 
we may lose competitive advantages by shifting our focus away from proprietary products to third party  integrated products and may face greater competition for such product sales 
we may be unsuccessful in differentiating ourselves from our competitors by emphasizing our service and support capabilities and could lose customers to the extent they have concerns about our financial viability 
we may face increased competition for our services  especially with respect to customers purchasing third party products  who may perceive other companies as having comparable or greater expertise with respect to such products 
such customers may be less likely to enter support and maintenance contracts with us than customers who purchased our proprietary solutions 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of our workforce reductions and any reductions we are compelled to make in the future 
reductions in our workforce could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations  as well as make it difficult to motivate and retain remaining 
table of contents employees  which would affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and otherwise negatively affect our business 
we also cannot assure you that these measures will be successful in achieving the expected benefits within the expected time frames or that the workforce reductions will not impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred million in charges relating to the restructuring and will incur additional charges in the first quarter of fiscal associated with additional restructuring actions 
we also may incur additional or unexpected costs associated with the restructuring  such as ongoing lease obligations at closed facilities or severance costs for terminated employees 
by focusing more on third party  instead of proprietary products  we may become more reliant on third parties to supply us with products 
in addition  we may incur additional costs associated with negotiating new contractual relationships to broaden our offering of third party products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate contracts with third party manufacturers necessary to implement the restructuring 
a failure to successfully implement the restructuring would have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we may need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations  and such additional financing may not be available 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we use cash generated from our operations  equity capital  bank financings and sales of our equity securities to fund capital expenditures  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations 
we believe that our working capital  cash flow from operating activities and amounts available under the canopy loan agreement  assuming our ability to borrow the full amount under the canopy loan agreement  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  canopy may terminate the canopy loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable upon an event of default  including upon days notice in the event that canopy in good faith deems itself to be insecure  the value of the collateral to have significantly declined from the date of the canopy loan agreement  or the prospect of timely payment or performance to be impaired 
if the canopy loan agreement were terminated and all outstanding amounts declared immediately due and payable  we would require additional financing 
in addition  projections for our capital requirements are subject to numerous uncertainties  including the cost savings expected to be realized from the restructuring  the amount of service and product revenue generated in fiscal and general economic conditions 
despite the restructuring activities that have taken place to date  we have continued to incur recurring losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring will be successful or that the anticipated cost savings will be realized 
also  in the longer term  if we do not realize substantial cost savings from our restructuring and achieve profitability  we will require additional funds in order to carry on our operations  and may seek to raise such funds through bank borrowings or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
we may need additional sources of financing in order to carry on our operations as presently conducted  which may include bank borrowings or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
we cannot assure you that such additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional financing is required but not available to us  we would have to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
our failure to raise required additional funds or to secure an additional credit facility would adversely affect our ability to maintain  develop or enhance our product offerings  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competitive pressures  or continue operations 

table of contents additional funds raised through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock may have the following negative effects on the then current common stockholders dilution in percentage of ownership in mti  and the rights  preferences or privileges of the new security holders may be senior to those of the common stockholders 
our securities may be removed from nasdaq listing 
our securities are currently listed and traded on the nasdaq national market 
to maintain our listing  we must meet nasdaq s required continued listing standards including minimum stockholders equity  number of shareholders and bid price 
on may   we received notice from nasdaq that we were not in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing standards because the bid price of our common stock closed below per share for consecutive trading days 
if we are not in compliance by august   we will be delisted 
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the continued listing standards in the future 
if we are delisted  we may not be able to secure listing on other exchanges or quotation systems 
this would materially adversely affect the price and liquidity of our common stock 
we are exposed to general economic conditions 
our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
continued softness in the information technology market in both the united states and in europe and consumers uncertainty about the global economic condition could result in reduced demand for our products and services 
as a result of the weakened global economy  consumers are postponing or reducing expenditures  causing our revenue  our operating results  and our financial condition to decline 
the downturn also has led to restructuring actions 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and thus  our operating results 
our business is affected adversely as a result of a weakening demand in the technology market 
our profitability depends upon the demand for information storage hardware  software and services as a whole 
a decreasing demand for information storage systems  software and services because of a weakening economy or otherwise  will result in decreased earnings 
a significant portion of our sales occurs in the last month of a given quarter and we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may not meet our expectations 
we have experienced historically a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly to increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter extremely difficult and uncertain 
if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be harmed materially for that quarter 
also  we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
as a result  our quarterly sales and operating results in any given quarter are dependent  in large part  upon the volume and timing of orders booked and products shipped during that quarter 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated decrease in our orders  sales or shipments 
therefore  any decline in the demand for our products and services  in relation to our forecast for any given quarter  could materially harm our results of operations 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share for our business 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing 
table of contents pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
furthermore  new products and technologies  whether developed by us or third parties  may depress the sales of existing products and technologies 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
since we plan to place more emphasis on integrating third party products  our ability to respond to new technologies will be substantially dependent upon our contractual relationships with manufacturers 
in addition  we must be able to quickly and effectively train our employees with respect to any new products or technologies 
since the third party products we sell are available from a large number of sources  we must distinguish ourselves by the quality of our service and support 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include quality of service and support  responsiveness to customer and market needs  product price  quality  reliability and performance  and ability to sell  service and deploy new technology 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including emc  hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  engineering  manufacturing  and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological  and personnel resources than we do 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be indicative of future results or helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we anticipate that these fluctuations may continue into the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including changes in demand for our vivant and s series lines of products and services  the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the size  timing and terms of customer orders  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of our products  shifts in our product or services mix  changes in our operating expenditures  the timing of sales  marketing research and development expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  any of which could cause a significant adverse change in the trading price of our common stock 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to sell new products on a timely basis 
we believe that our ability to sell  deploy and service new  innovative products with features that respond to our customers changing demands and that incorporate new technological standards will be critical to our future success 
we are dependent upon our ability to contract with manufacturers to sell their existing products  as well as new product introductions that address customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure by us to update our product offerings  train our staff to support and service such 
table of contents products or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could harm our business materially 
our systems are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly  and time consuming to repair 
undetected software or hardware errors frequently occur in networking products when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
our systems are complex  and from time to time we may find errors in our existing  new  or enhanced products 
also  our systems are combined with products and components made by other vendors  and if errors occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these errors  whether caused by our or another vendor s products  could adversely affect sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
we are dependent upon limited source suppliers for principal components used in our products  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in component costs could harm our business materially 
we currently purchase several key materials used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited source suppliers 
for example  for our vivant product line  we currently purchase disk drives from seagate technology  inc and xyratex corporation  chipsets from arrow electronics  a distributor of the qlogic chipsets  and raid controllers for the vivant s series from xyratex  an original equipment manufacturer for ibm mylex 
we may fail to obtain required materials in a timely manner in the future  or could experience delays from evaluating and testing the products of potential alternative suppliers 
the recent softening of demand in the telecommunications industry could adversely impact the financial condition of our suppliers  many of whom have limited financial resources 
we have in the past  and may in the future  be required to provide advance payments in order to secure key materials from financially limited suppliers 
financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers could limit the availability of key components or materials 
additionally  financial difficulties could impair our ability to recover advances made to these suppliers 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these materials  or the inability to obtain these materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
we order products  components and materials based upon rolling forecasts which could cause us to overestimate or underestimate our actual requirements 
this could cause us to increase our costs needlessly or prevent us from meeting customer demand 
we use rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component and product inventory requirements 
lead times for products  materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend upon factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for such products or components 
as a result  our product and component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our product or component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our product or component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and integration and delay delivery of our 
table of contents products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would unfavorably affect our business and results of operations 
we depend upon our key personnel 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of the services of our executive officers could harm materially our business 
the failure to retain key members of our senior management team  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our senior management team  could materially harm our business 
in addition  a number of the members of our senior management team joined us recently  as we replaced certain management personnel  including the recent termination of paul emery  our chief operating officer and the hiring of mark franzen as chief financial officer 
thus  our management team has had limited time to work together and as a result  may have difficulty working together to successfully manage our business 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales and services 
international sales and services represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
for example  international sales and service revenue represented of our total sales and service revenue for fiscal year if we are unable to maintain international market demand for our products and services  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  import or export restrictions  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  and differing customer and or technology standards requirements 
all of our sales and services in international markets are priced in the applicable local currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
such contracts can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results from operations could suffer 
terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and europe and the military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents our intellectual property is critical to our business and  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  the success of our business and our results of operations could be harmed materially 
our intellectual property includes patents  proprietary technology  trade secrets  copyrights  and trademarks 
we rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to detect this unauthorized usage or to enforce our rights effectively 
any legal action that we may bring to protect our intellectual property rights could be expensive and distract our management from day to day operations 
further  the laws of some countries in which we sell our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in the united states 
unauthorized usage or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business materially 
we may face costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
in addition  in the future  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses  or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we could have to redesign our products  which could be costly and time consuming and could substantially delay product shipments  assuming that a redesign is feasible 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  likely would be time consuming  costly  and a distraction to our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
if we are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may be unable either to sell our systems or to be competitive in the marketplace 
our systems must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the united states and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we introduce in the future also must meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our systems integrate san and nas technologies into single storage architecture 
components of the san and nas must comply with evolving industry standards 
we also depend upon companies that provide other components of the san and nas to meet these standards 
if our vendors or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
an adverse judgment in the securities class action litigation in which we  and several of our officers are defendants could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
from july through september  several class action complaints were filed against us and several of our officers  alleging that we were aware of adverse information that we failed to disclose primarily during fiscal and  hence  that we violated specified provisions of the securities exchange act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the plaintiffs in those cases filed a consolidated amended complaint in the federal court for the central district of california on or about december   making similar allegations 
this consolidated complaint alleges a class period from july  to july  and alleges that the defendants were aware of certain adverse information that they failed to disclose during that period 
we filed a 
table of contents motion to dismiss the complaint  which the district court granted 
however  the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint  and  on october   the district court denied our motion to dismiss that complaint 
the second amended complaint alleges a class period from july  to july  the trial date is august  the plaintiffs have not specified the amount of damages they seek 
although we believe the alleged claims in this lawsuit are without merit and are defending the lawsuit vigorously  due to the inherent uncertainties of the litigation process and the judicial system  we are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation 
this litigation may result in substantial costs and distract management s attention and resources 
as of april   we met the deductible of our insurance policy 
in addition  this litigation may negatively impact our ability to attract new officers or directors 
a judgment against us in this case could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a single stockholder  and other stockholders may not be able to influence corporate decisions 
raymond j 
noorda  our chairman of the board  is also the chairman of the board of canopy and ralph j 
yarro iii  one of our directors  is also the director and president and chief executive officer of canopy 
canopy beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock and is able to substantially affect our actions which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without mr 
noorda s or mr 
yarro s support 
our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of your investment in our company could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock variations between our actual and anticipated earnings  the timing and announcement of new products or services by us or by our competitors  services or technological innovations by us or by our competitors  failure of our results from operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or our competitive position  potential de listing from the nasdaq exchange the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions broadly and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
in addition  stock markets  particularly the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of securities of companies such as ours have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
fluctuations such as these may affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management s attention and resources 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions  provisions for staggered terms of office of the board of directors  and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
also  the rights of holders of our common stock may be affected adversely by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to 
table of contents the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
we have used and may continue to use hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks  none of which were outstanding at april  there can be no assurance that such actions successfully will reduce our exposure to financial market risks
