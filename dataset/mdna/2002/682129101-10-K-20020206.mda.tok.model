a sudden and prolonged deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the company s customers requiring the company to increase its reserves for bad debts 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserves for obsolescence 
a significant increase in roofing system repairs or replacements could also require the company to increase its reserves for warranty claims 
if such adverse conditions would occur  the company cannot readily predict the effect on its financial condition or results of operations as any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions

the effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters
