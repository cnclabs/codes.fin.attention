item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates affect  among other things  the amounts of receivables  rental and merchandise inventories  property and equipment  net  goodwill  net  deferred income tax assets  other liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  and operating costs and expenses 
we base our judgments  assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from amounts based on our judgments  assumption and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates  which affect amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the rental and sale of our products 
rental revenue for extended rental periods when the customer chooses to keep the product beyond the original rental period is recognized when the extended rental period begins 
revenue recorded for extended rental periods is net of estimated amounts that we do not anticipate collecting based upon historical collection experience 
we continuously monitor actual collections 
estimates are revised when we believe it is appropriate in light of actual collection rates and other relevant circumstances 
historically  actual collections have approximated the related net revenue recorded 
however  if actual collections in the future are less than the related net revenue recorded  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
amortization of rental inventory rental inventory  which includes vhs videocassettes  dvds and video games  is stated at cost and amortized over its estimated useful life to an estimated residual value 
our estimates of useful lives and residual values affect the amounts of amortization recorded  which in turn affects the carrying value of our rental inventory and cost of rental and  upon the transfer of previously viewed items from rental inventory to merchandise inventory  the carrying value of our merchandise inventory and cost of product 
for new release tapes acquired for rental under revenue sharing arrangements  the studios share of rental revenue is expensed as revenue is earned net of an average estimated interim residual value 
tapes  dvds and video games acquired for rental at fixed prices are amortized to estimated interim residual values in four months and then to estimated ending residual values over their remaining estimated useful lives 
purchases of catalog products are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to their estimated ending residual values 
due to the numerous variables associated with the judgments and assumptions we make in estimating useful lives and residual values of these items  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these estimates including the effects of competing products and technologies and actual selling prices obtainable for previously viewed product  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  a number of observations led us to change our estimates of rental inventory lives and residual values  which resulted in a million increase to amortization expense in that quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be a primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows eg  at the store level 
we deem a store to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the store  including estimated disposal value  if any  is less than the asset carrying amount 
if a store is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount on our balance sheet of the store exceeds its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a discounted future cash flow valuation technique similar to that used by management in making a new investment decision 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of our assets in these circumstances  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related impairment charges are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change significantly 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements and tax returns 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including temporary timing differences and net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount expected to be realized in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  in light of significant doubt that existed regarding our future income and therefore our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a million valuation allowance on our million net deferred tax asset 
in  as a result of our operating performance for the year  as well as anticipated future operating performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain future tax benefits would be realized 
as such  we reversed million of this valuation allowance  which resulted in a million increase in net income and a corresponding decrease in our shareholders deficit 
the valuation allowance of million as of december  represents an allowance for the uncertainty as to the future realization of deferred tax assets based upon our revised expectations 
while changes in the valuation allowance have no effect on the amount of income tax we pay or on our cash flows  the effects on our reported income and shareholders equity may be viewed by some investors and potential lenders as significant 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
legal contingencies our estimates of our loss contingencies for legal proceedings are based on various judgments and assumptions regarding the potential resolution or disposition of the underlying claims and associated costs 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
results of operations summary results of operations our net income for was million compared to a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in the improvement in operating results was primarily the result of improved operating performance in our existing store base  adjustments to our valuation allowance on our net deferred income tax asset see note to the consolidated financial statements and closing down the e commerce operations at reel 
com in june of the large net loss in was primarily the result of special charges summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements

also favorably impacting revenue was an additional weighted average number of stores 
the closure of reel 
com in june  which had total revenue of million in  unfavorably impacted revenue 
revenue increased by million  or in compared to  primarily due to the addition of new superstores in revenue was also favorably impacted by an increase of in comparable store revenue in we ended with  superstores operating in states  compared to  stores operating in states at the end of and  stores operating in states at the end of we currently offer a day rental program on all products in the majority of our stores 
new release videos and all dvds rent for 
catalog videos rent for 
since the fourth quarter of  we have not increased prices on new release videos  dvds and catalog videos 
video games rent for and  with the newer platforms renting for the higher amount 
customers who choose not to return movies within the applicable rental period are deemed to have commenced a new rental period of equal length at the same price 
rental revenue from initial rental periods was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
rental revenue from extended rental periods was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross margin rental margins rental gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue increased to in from in during the fourth quarter of  we made several key observations that led us to change estimates regarding rental inventory lives and residual values 
as a result of the growing demand for dvds  the estimated residual value of catalog vhs cassettes was reduced from to and the estimated useful life was reduced from five years to one year 
we adopted the changes in estimate prospectively on october   and recorded a charge of million 
by applying these changes prospectively  we also recorded incremental depreciation expense of approximately million and million in the fourth quarter of  and in the first three quarters of  respectively 
excluding the charge and the respective incremental depreciation expense amounts  margins increased to in from in primarily due to a shift in revenue from vhs to dvds  which typically have higher margins 
rental gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue decreased to in from in  primarily due to the charge and incremental depreciation associated with the change in estimates discussed above 
product margins product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in product margins in were negatively impacted by a million charge for the discontinuation of e commerce operations at reel 
com and a million charge to value the inventory on hand at december  at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
excluding the operations of reel 
com and the million charge  product margins increased to in from in  primarily due to improved margins on previously viewed movie sales 
compared to  margins on previously viewed product for increased due to the depreciation change in estimate  which resulted in lower residual values being charged to cost of product sales 
product gross margin as a percentage of product sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to the charges noted above 
excluding the operations of reel 
com and the million charge  product margins decreased to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of previously viewed movies for sale 
operating costs and expenses operating and selling total operating and selling expenses of million in decreased million from million in total operating and selling expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in impacting operating and selling expense in was a million charge for impaired property and equipment see note to consolidated financial statements and reel 
com operating expenses of million 
excluding the impairment charge and operating expenses of reel 
com  operating and selling expenses decreased million for as compared to the decrease was driven by decreases in advertising expense of million  other operating and selling expenses of million and depreciation expense of million  which were partially offset by an increase in store wages of million and occupancy costs of million 
the decrease in advertising expense was the result of the discontinuation of a mass media advertising campaign that ran in in  we returned to a more cost effective direct mail strategy 
the increases in store wages and occupancy costs were primarily due to the addition of weighted average stores when compared to the prior year 
total operating and selling expenses of million in increased million from million in total operating and selling expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in total operating and selling expenses was due to increases in depreciation expense of million primarily caused by the impairment charge noted above  store wages of million  occupancy costs of million  advertising expenses of million  and other store operating expenses of million  which were offset by an million decrease in expenses incurred by reel 
com 
the decrease in reel 
com expenses was primarily due to operating reel 
com for six months in compared to the entire year in the increases in store wages  occupancy costs  and other store operating expenses were primarily due to the increase in the number of superstores operated by us 
we operated  superstores at december  compared with  superstores at the end of advertising expense was higher due to an increase in national television campaigns as compared to prior years 
restructuring for closure of internet business on june   we announced that we would close down the e commerce business of reel 
com 
although we had developed a leading web site over the seven quarters after reel 
com was purchased in october of  reel 
com s business model of rapid customer acquisition led to large operating losses and required significant cash funding 
due to market conditions  we were unable to obtain outside financing for reel 
com  and could not justify continued funding from our superstore cash flow 
on june   we terminated the employment of approximately of reel 
com s employees  and paid million in involuntary termination benefits 
the remaining employees have since been terminated or integrated into hollywood entertainment 
as a result of the discontinuation of reel 
com s e commerce operations  we recorded a total charge of million in the second quarter of  of which million was classified as a restructuring charge on the consolidated statement of operations and million was included in cost of product sales 
the charge was reduced by million to million in the fourth quarter of  and also reduced by million to million in the fourth quarter of  because we were able to negotiate termination of certain obligations and lease commitments more favorably than originally anticipated 
the restructuring charge line item included million of severance and benefits paid on june   million of asset impairment charges  and million net of reductions of accrued liabilities 
the asset impairment charges included million to write off the remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of reel 
com  and million to write down equipment  leasehold improvements  prepaid expenses and accounts receivable to their net realizable values 
amounts accrued included net of reductions million for contractual obligations  lease commitments and anticipated legal claims against the company and net of reductions million for legal  financial  and other professional services incurred as a direct result of the closure of reel 
com 
as of december   we had paid million of the accrued amounts 
restructuring charge for store closures in december  we approved a restructuring plan involving the closure and disposition of stores that were not operating to our expectations the restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges aggregating million  including an million write down of property and equipment  a million write down of goodwill and an accrual for store closing costs of million 
the established reserve for store closing costs is for lease termination fees and other store closure costs 
we have liquidated  and plan to continue liquidating  related store inventories through store closing sales  any remaining product will be used in other stores 
revenue during the years ended december  and for the stores included in the restructuring plan was approximately million and million  respectively 
operating income or loss defined as income or loss before interest expense and income taxes during the years ended december  and for the stores included in the restructuring plan were approximately million loss and million loss  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december  these stores recorded a combined operating loss of million that is included in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we had closed of the scheduled stores that we included in the restructuring plan 
we incurred  in expenses during the twelve months ended december  related to the closures and received  to exit one of the leases 
in december of  we amended the restructuring plan and removed stores from the closure list 
we anticipate closing the remaining stores in in accordance with the amended plan  and updated estimates of closing costs  we reversed million of the original million charge  leaving a million accrual balance at december  for store closing costs 
general and administrative total general and administrative expenses of million in decreased million from million in total general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in included in general and administrative expenses in were employee loans written off or fully reserved for as doubtful for million  reserves established for pending litigation for million and reel 
com general and administrative expenses of million 
included in general and administrative expenses in were million of non cash compensation expense related to a stock grant to our chief executive officer as part of a three year employment agreement 
also included was million of non cash stock compensation associated with other grants under our stock option plans 
excluding the adjustments noted above  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in compared to in the prior year 
we made the decision to invest in certain elements of the business  such as the store field supervision structure  the loss prevention function and human resources 
we believe these investments will have a direct impact on the business by improving the level of execution 
total general administrative expenses of million increased million from million in total general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in compared to in included in general and administrative expenses in is a special charge of million for legal and settlement charges associated with the settlement of two lawsuits 
excluding these charges  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  primarily due to employee loans written off or fully reserved for as doubtful  other payroll and related costs  and establishing reserves for pending litigation  offset by a million decrease in overhead costs associated with reel 
com 
the decrease in reel 
com expenses was primarily due to operating reel 
com for only six months in compared to the entire year in amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of million taken in the fourth quarter of related to acquired store goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and the closure in june of of reel 
com  which had million of amortization expense in the prior year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the discontinuation of reel 
com s e commerce operations and the resulting charges 
amortization of intangibles increased by million in compared to  primarily due to an impairment charge of million related to goodwill on several acquired stores as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as partially offset by a decrease in amortization of goodwill associated with the reel 
com acquisition 
non operating income expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in compared to  primarily due to decreased levels of revolving credit borrowings and lower interest rates 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased in compared to  due to increased revolving credit borrowings and higher interest rates and the issuance in june of an additional million of senior subordinated notes 
income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to a provision of in and a provision of in which varies from the federal statutory rate as a result of non deductible executive compensation  net non deductible option grant compensation  non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the reel 
com acquisition  state income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances 
valuation allowances reduce deferred income tax balances to the approximate amount of recoverable income taxes based on assessments of taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods for each year 
change in effect of a change in accounting principle in april  sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities was finalized  which requires that cost incurred for start up activities  such as store openings  be expensed as incurred 
we adopted sop effective january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was to increase net loss by million  net of tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources overview during  we experienced a number of significant events with respect to our liquidity and capital situation 
we began the year growing at the average rate of one store per day  as well as funding significant cash losses at reel 
com 
in order to meet the funding needs to continue at this growth rate  our then existing million revolving credit facility needed to be expanded or refinanced 
during early  we attempted to refinance this facility 
in march  we received an underwritten commitment from a group of banks for a new million credit facility 
however  syndication of this new facility failed in may primarily due to market conditions including lenders concerns with losses at reel 
com and the business of internet companies generally and the significant capital needed to fund our aggressive growth 
without the availability of new funding  we were faced with a requirement to begin reducing the maximum borrowing capacity under the million revolving credit facility  starting with a million reduction on december  and quarterly reductions of million in each quarter thereafter  and to make such payments as would be necessary to cause the borrowings outstanding under the facility to be less than or equal to the reduced borrowing capacity 
in order to meet this obligation  we needed to make significant changes to our growth plans 
as part of these changes  in june of  we closed the e commerce business at reel 
com  thereby stopping its cash losses 
furthermore  we made the decision to curtail our new store growth and not sign new leases for the remainder of the year 
we believe that by discontinuing reel 
com s e commerce operations which were losing money at an annual run rate of approximately million in early  and by largely curtailing our new store growth in which we were investing at an annual run rate of approximately million in early  we have substantially reduced our ongoing uses of cash from that of early and before 
on june   we obtained a waiver for non compliance with certain covenants under the revolving credit facility  including a leverage ratio covenant and a covenant regarding loans to affiliated persons 
this temporary waiver was extended on june  and again on july  the revolving credit facility was amended on august  to permanently amend these covenants 
as consideration for the requested amendment  we agreed to certain new covenants which  among other things  placed restrictions on capital expenditures and store growth 
these amendments did not affect the amortization schedule of the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we were in violation of covenants under the revolving credit facility regarding our tangible net worth ratio  our leverage ratio and our interest coverage ratio 
although we obtained a waiver for the violations  the waiver was scheduled to expire on may  because it was probable we would incur covenant violations after may  without a restructured agreement  in accordance with fas  classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor  we reclassified million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   such that the entire million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolving credit facility were classified as current liabilities as of that date 
as a result of the uncertainty regarding our ability to negotiate a permanent amendment to the revolving credit facility and the fact that we had net losses in   and and at december  had a shareholders deficit of million  our independent accountants included a going concern paragraph in their report on our consolidated financial statements for because it was doubtful that we would be able to meet the scheduled revolving credit facility amortization of million  we began negotiating a restructured amortization schedule with our lenders 
on march   we made a million amortization payment and our lenders agreed to defer million of the million total due on that date until may  during the deferral period we and our lenders worked toward a permanent change in the amortization schedule to better match bank debt pay down with our business plan 
on may   we made a million amortization payment and our lenders agreed to defer until june  on june   we amended our revolving credit facility and  in connection therewith  paid to the lenders fees of approximately million 
the amendment extended the maturity of the facility from september  to december   and created a new amortization payment schedule 
in connection with the amendment  million of the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility were reclassified as long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheet as of june  as a result of the amendment  our independent accountants removed the going concern paragraph from their report 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the amended facility was set at ibor plus  subject to reduction upon the achievement of specified performance targets 
we generate substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash from the rental and sales of videocassettes  dvds and games 
the amount of cash generated from operations in funded our debt service requirements and all capital expenditures with sufficient cash left over to reduce accounts payable by million 
at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
on december   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering up to  of our common stock together with up to an additional  of our common stock for purposes of satisfying any over allotment options and up to  of non convertible debt securities 
on december   we announced that we received a fully underwritten commitment from ubs warburg llc for a new bank credit facility 
on february  the shelf registration statement became effective 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock resulting in proceeds of million before underwriting fees and expenses  of which million was applied to the repayment of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
on march   we obtained new senior bank credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders led by ubs warburg llc consisting of a million senior secured term facility maturing in and a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in we applied a portion of initial borrowings thereunder to repay all remaining borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility which was then terminated 
the maturity of the new facilities will automatically be extended to if our existing million senior subordinated notes are refinanced prior to february with a maturity date beyond which  subject to market conditions and other relevant factors  we presently expect to accomplish through the issuance of new senior subordinated notes in as contemplated in our shelf registration statement 
as a result of the early retirement of our prior revolving credit facilities  we anticipate recording an extraordinary charge of approximately million in the first quarter of the credit agreement governing the new facilities contains customary representations  warranties  covenants including financial covenants and events of default 
the financial covenants  some of which may become more restrictive over time  include a maximum debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  minimum interest coverage test  and minimum fixed charge coverage test determined in each case on the basis of the definitions and other provisions set forth in such credit agreement 
currently  these financial covenants require us to maintain a ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda of to or less  a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of to or greater  and a ratio of adjusted ebitda  plus rent expense  to fixed charges of at least to we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations  revolving credit availability and other capital resources will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements associated with our present operations for the foreseeable future 
we continue to analyze our strategic plan and capital structure and to consider additional financing transactions  including possible issuances of debt securities  as sources of incremental liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to excluding the effects of changes in accounts payable  our net cash flow from operations would have increased by million or in the increase was due to the discontinuation of e commerce operations at reel 
com and improved operating performance in our existing store base 
the increase was partially offset by net pay downs of accounts payable in of million compared to a net increase in accounts payable in of million 
we lease all of our stores  corporate offices  distribution centers and zone offices under non cancelable operating leases 
all of our stores have an initial operating lease term of five to years and most have options to renew for between five and additional years 
at december   the future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases were as follows operating year ending leases december  in thousands thereafter  cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease is primarily due to fewer new store openings in we opened new stores in and only six stores in following is a table summarizing our cash used in investing activities for the last three years in thousands rental inventory new release replenishment    new store and other investments    book value of transfers to merchandise inventory and loss    purchases of rental inventory  net    purchase of property and equipment  net    investment in businesses acquired  increase in intangibles and other assets    total cash used in investing    new release replenishment includes the cost of purchases of new release video tapes  dvds and games for existing stores and the estimated interim residual value of video tapes and dvds acquired under revenue sharing arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
it does not include net revenue sharing expense included in cost of rental on the statement of operations 
net revenue sharing expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
new store and other investments in rental product includes all fixed price rental inventories for new store openings  major catalog inventory enhancement projects  such as an expansion of dvd catalog  and other long term investments not considered new release replenishment 
capital expenditures other than for product include expenditures for equipment  fixtures  and leasehold improvements for new and existing stores  remodeling projects  and implementing and upgrading office and store technology 
we anticipate that capital expenditures  other than purchases of rental inventory  will be approximately million in  of which million is anticipated to relate to new  relocated or remodeled stores 
the remaining balance relates to corporate capital expenditures 
we presently intend to seek to open approximately new stores during the remainder of and to increase our store base by approximately per year thereafter 
cash flow from financing activities in our cash flow from financing activities was a net use of million compared to million of net cash provided by financing activities in the slowing of store growth coupled with an increase in cash provided by operations allowed us to operate with internally generated cash flow instead of outside financing 
over the course of  we repaid million of principal on capital leases and reduced amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility by million 
at december  the balance outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility was at million  or million under the maximum availability of million 
as of march   we had million available under our new senior secured revolving credit facility 
other financial measurements working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
the working capital deficit is primarily the result of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as discussed below 
other factors contributing to the deficit were the current amounts due under our prior revolving credit facility and significant accrued expenditures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
rental inventories are accounted for as non current assets under gaap because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of our revenue  the classification of these assets as non current excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  we believe working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as a non current asset  we will  more likely than not  operate with a working capital deficit 
we believe the current existence of a working capital deficit does not affect our ability to operate our business and meet obligations as they come due 
other financial measurements adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we believe other financial measurements  such as adjusted ebitda and free cash flow  as defined below  are additional measurements that are useful in understanding our operating results  including our ability to meet our growth plans and debt service requirements 
these measurements should not be viewed as a measure of financial performance under gaap or as substitute for gaap measurements such as net income or cash flow from operations 
our calculation of these measurements is not necessarily comparable to those reported by other companies due to the lack of uniform definitions 
adjusted ebtida represents income loss from operations  before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda  plus certain special charges  plus non cash expenses  minus the cost of replenishing new release rental inventory for existing stores  which is capitalized see item  selected financial data  for a reconciliation of ebitda to adjusted ebitda

general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality we anticipate that our business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including i variations in the number and timing of new store openings  ii the performance of new or acquired stores  iii the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  iv additional and existing competition  v marketing programs  vi the level of demand for movie and video game rentals and purchases  vii the effects of changing and or new technology and intense competition  viii the prices for which we are able to rent or sell our products  ix the costs and availability to us of newly released movies and video games  x changes in other significant operating costs and expenses  xi the effects of our substantial indebtedness and the limitations imposed by restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments  xii our ability to manage store expansions and growth  xiii acts of god or public authorities  war  civil unrest  fire  floods  earthquakes  acts of terrorism  the weather and other matters beyond our control 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
we believe these seasonality trends will continue 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve substantial risks and uncertainties and which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical information and include the words expects  believes  anticipates  plans  may  will  intend  estimate  continue or other similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  items discussed below under the heading cautionary statements and above under the heading general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release or update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are  however  advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and any reports made on form k to the securities and exchange commission 
cautionary statements we are subject to a number of risks that are particular to our business and that may or may not affect our competitors 
we describe some of these risks below 
if any of these risks materializes  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed  and the value of our securities could fall 
we face intense competition and risks associated with technological obsolescence  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
the home video and home video game industries are highly competitive 
we compete with local  regional and national video retail stores  including those operated by blockbuster  inc  the largest video retailer in the united states  and with mass merchants  specialty retailers  supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  mail order operations  online stores and other retailers  as well as with noncommercial sources  such as libraries 
substantially all of our stores compete with stores operated by blockbuster  most in very close proximity 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  market share and name recognition than hollywood 
as a result of direct competition with blockbuster and others  pricing strategies for videos and video games is a significant competitive factor in our business 
our home video and home video game businesses also compete with other forms of entertainment  including cinema  television  sporting events and family entertainment centers 
if we do not compete effectively with competitors in the home video industry or the home video game industry or with providers of other forms of entertainment  our revenues and or our profit margin could decline and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
we also compete with cable and direct broadcast satellite television systems 
these systems offer both movie channels  for which subscribers pay a subscription fee for access to movies selected by the provider at times selected by the provider  and pay per view services  for which subscribers pay a discrete fee to view a particular movie selected by the subscriber 
historically pay per view services have offered a limited number of channels and movies  and have offered movies only at scheduled intervals 
today  however  advances in digital compression and other developing technologies are enabling cable and satellite companies  and may enable internet service providers and others  to transmit a significantly greater number of movies to homes at more frequently scheduled intervals throughout the day 
in addition  certain cable companies  internet service providers and others have tested and are continuing to test video on demand services in some markets 
as a concept  video on demand would provide a subscriber with the ability to view any movie included in a catalog of titles maintained by the provider at any time of the day 
if video on demand or other alternative movie delivery systems  whether alone or in conjunction with sophisticated digital recording systems which allow viewers to record  pause  rewind and fast forward live broadcasts  achieve the ability to enable consumers to conveniently view and control the movies they want to see when they want to see them  such alternative movie delivery systems could achieve a competitive advantage over the traditional video rental industry 
while we believe that there presently exist substantial technological  economic and other impediments to alternative movie delivery systems achieving such a competitive advantage  technological advances and other developments could enable them to do so  which in turn could harm our profitability and otherwise harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
changes in the way that movie studios price videocassettes and or dvds could adversely affect our revenues and profit margins 
movie studios use various pricing models to maximize the revenues they receive for movies released to the home video industry 
historically  these pricing models have enabled a profitable video rental market to exist and compete effectively with mass retailers and other sellers of home videos 
initially  the movie studios adopted a rental pricing model under which high initial wholesale prices are established in order for the studios to maximize revenues from rental retailers prior to setting prices at levels to create demand from mass merchants 
more recently  movie studios have entered into revenue sharing arrangements usually on a title by title basis under which studios provide movies to video rental retailers at reduced prices in exchange for a share of rental revenues 
movie studios have also utilized sell through pricing under which lower wholesale prices generate more consumer demand for home video purchases  but also result in an increase in profit margins on video rentals 
we can neither control nor predict with certainty whether the studios pricing policies will continue to enable us to operate our business as profitably as we can under current pricing arrangements 
if the studios were to significantly change their pricing policies in a manner that increases our cost of obtaining movies under revenue sharing arrangements or other arrangements  our revenues and or profit margin could decrease  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations would be harmed 
we could lose a significant competitive advantage if the movie studios were to adversely change their current distribution practices 
currently  video stores receive movie titles approximately to days earlier than pay per view  cable and satellite distribution companies 
if movie studios were to change the current distribution schedule for movie titles such that video stores were no longer the first major distribution channel to receive a movie title after its theatrical or direct to video release or to provide for the earlier release of movie titles to competing distribution channels  we could be deprived of a significant competitive advantage  which could negatively impact the demand for our products and reduce our revenues and could harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the video store industry could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the motion picture industry 
the video store industry is dependent on the continued production and availability of motion pictures produced by movie studios 
any conditions that adversely affect the motion picture industry  including constraints on capital  financial difficulties  regulatory requirements and strikes  work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers  actors or other essential personnel  could reduce the number and quality of the new release titles in our stores 
this in turn could reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our revenues  which would harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the failure of video game software and hardware manufacturers to timely introduce new products could hurt our ability to attract and retain video game rental customers 
we are dependent on the introduction of new and enhanced video games and game systems to attract and retain video game rental customers 
if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new games and systems  the demand for games available to us could decline  negatively impacting our revenues  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
expansion of our store base has placed and may place pressure on our operations and management controls 
we have expanded the size of our store base and the geographic scope of operations significantly since our inception 
between and we opened an average of stores per year 
although we have currently curtailed new store openings  we intend to open new stores in the future 
this expansion has placed  and may continue to place  increased pressure on our operating and management controls 
to manage a larger store base  we will need to continue to evaluate and improve our financial controls  management information systems and distribution facilities 
we may not adequately anticipate or respond to all of the changing demands of expansion on our infrastructure 
in addition  our ability to open and operate new stores in a profitable manner depends upon numerous contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
these contingencies include our ability under the terms of the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness to make capital expenditures associated with new store openings  our ability to locate suitable store sites  negotiate acceptable lease terms  and build out or refurbish sites on a timely and cost effective basis  our ability to hire  train and retain skilled associates  and our ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations 
we may also open stores in markets where we already have significant operations in order to maximize our market share within these markets 
if we do so  we cannot assure you that these newly opened stores will not adversely affect the revenues and profitability of those pre existing stores in any given market 
we depend on key personnel whom we may not be able to retain  recent management changes are unproven 
our future performance depends on the continued contributions of certain key management personnel 
from late through mid  we made significant changes to our management personnel  including adding two new outside directors to the board of directors  reinstating mark j 
wattles  hollywood s founder and chief executive officer  full time as president  hiring scott r 
schultze  who subsequently became executive vice president and chief operating officer  hiring james a 
marcum as executive vice president and chief financial officer and restructuring other executive and senior management positions 
these new members of management may not be able to successfully manage our existing operations and they may not remain with us 
a loss of one or more of these key management personnel  our inability to attract and retain additional key management personnel  including qualified store managers  or the inability of management to successfully manage our operations could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could harm our business 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems 
in particular  we rely on an inventory utilization system used by our merchandise organization and in our distribution centers to track rental activity by individual videocassette  dvd and video game to determine appropriate buying  distribution and disposition of videocassettes  dvds and video games 
we use a scalable client server system to maintain information  updated daily  regarding revenue  current and historical rental and sales activity  demographics of store membership  individual customer history  and videocassette  dvd and video game rental patterns 
we rely on these systems as well as our proprietary point of sale and in store systems to keep our in store inventories at optimum levels  to move inventory efficiently and to track and record our performance 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could impair our ability to manage our inventory and monitor our performance and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain covenants that restrict our business 
instruments governing our new bank credit facility in which ubs warburg is acting as agent for the lenders thereunder  as well as a lender and our existing senior subordinated notes due contain  and our future indebtedness may contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  significantly restrict our ability to open new stores  incur additional indebtedness  guarantee third party obligations  enter into capital leases  create liens on assets  dispose of assets  repay indebtedness or amend indebtedness instruments  make capital expenditures  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations  and engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations  which could adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility and increase our vulnerability to adverse conditions 
as of december  we had total consolidated long term debt  including capital leases  of approximately million 
this level of indebtedness could increase in the future 
our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or taking advantage of potential business opportunities  limit our ability to execute our business strategy successfully  and place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 
we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness that would be secured by our assets or those of our subsidiaries 
if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries current indebtedness levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to economic  industry and market conditions and to risks related to our business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the debt securities  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain various covenants  including covenants requiring us to meet specified financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with all applicable covenants could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable 
the instruments governing our existing indebtedness contain various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to make capital expenditures and require us to meet specified financial ratios  which generally become more stringent over time  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest and rent coverage ratio 
the instruments governing our future indebtedness may impose similar or other restrictions and may require us to meet similar or other financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control 
if we breach any of these covenants  one or more events of default  including cross defaults between multiple components of our indebtedness  could result 
these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owing to be immediately due and payable  and terminate any commitments to make further extensions of credit 
if we were unable to repay indebtedness owed to our secured creditors  they could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness owed to them 
we are subject to governmental regulations that impose obligations and restrictions and may increase our costs 
we are subject to various us federal and state laws that govern  among other things  the disclosure and retention of our video rental records and access and use of our video stores by disabled persons  and are subject to various state and local licensing  zoning  land use  construction and environment regulations 
furthermore  changes in existing laws  including environmental and employment laws  new laws or increases in the minimum wage may increase our costs 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war against the united states or united states businesses 
also  as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into armed conflict 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers 
furthermore  these attacks or armed conflicts may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease further or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations  and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future price of our securities 
our quarterly operating results will vary  which may affect the value of our securities in a manner unrelated to our long term performance 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and we expect that they will continue to vary in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to vary include the level of demand for movie rentals and purchases  existing and future competition from providers of similar products and alternative forms of entertainment  the prices for which we are able to rent or sell our products  the availability and cost to us of newly released movies  changes in other significant operating costs and expenses  weather  seasonality  variations in the number and timing of store openings  the performance of newer stores  acquisitions by us of existing video stores  the success of new business initiatives  other factors that may affect retailers in general  changes in movie rental habits resulting from domestic and world events  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and acts of god or public authorities  war  civil unrest  fire  floods  earthquakes  acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control 
our securities may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our securities has been and can be expected to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including public announcements concerning us  our competitors or the home video rental industry  fluctuations in our operating results  introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  and changes in analysts revenue or earnings estimates 
in addition to the foregoing  the market price of our debt securities may be significantly affected by change in market rates of interest  yields obtainable from investments in comparable securities  credit ratings assigned to our debt securities by third parties and perceptions regarding our ability to pay our obligations on our debt securities 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the target of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs and suffer from a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
future sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
if we or our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following this offering  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain provisions prohibiting or limiting the payment of dividends on our common stock 
provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult to acquire us  even though an acquisition may be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated with any shares of our common stock that may be acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute a control share acquisitions upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquiror in any such transaction 
provisions or oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
in addition  under our articles of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the foregoing provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of hollywood  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock and the occurrence of a control share acquisition may constitute an event of default under  or otherwise require us to repurchase or repay  our indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we have entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term and long term debt 
historically  and as of december   we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
however  we may in the future enter into such instruments for the purpose of addressing market risks  including market risks associated with variable rate indebtedness 
the interest payable on our bank credit facility is based on variable interest rates ibor or the prime bank rate at our option  and therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
hypothetically  if variable base rates were to increase in as compared to the end of  our interest rate expense would increase by approximately million based on our outstanding balance on the facility as of december
