overview the company is a corporation with a limited operating history  formed in february  when it commenced field trial and limited sales of its original product  the foxbox 
additionally  efforts were made to obtain operating capital and convert the company to a public entity 
this was successfully accomplished through a reverse merger with watchdog patrols  inc  a publicly traded otcbb  non reporting corporation 
operating expenses have increased significantly since the company s inception 
this reflects the cost associated with the formation of the company as well as increased efforts to promote market awareness for the company s security products and services  solicit new customers  recruit personnel  build operating infrastructure and continued product development 
netwolves products and services offer complete system solutions to organizations needing cost effective network security firewall  routing  intrusion detection  content filtering  email  intranet  ftp  etc 
complete with advanced integrated hardware  a user friendly interface  and net based expansion capabilities 
as companies combine data and communications to reduce costs  netwolves provides cost effective  value added expansion technologies such as vpn  a process used to allow secure data transmissions on a local area network  a wide area network  or to secure wireless network connections 
this feature affords the user virtually all the benefits of lease line service without the attendant recurring costs 
netwolves differentiates itself from its competitors primarily through its proprietary patent pending technology  which provides centralized remote monitoring and management srm tm 
while other  more labor intensive management systems currently exist  such systems require an inbound administrative port to provide remote monitoring and management 
most fortune companies are unwilling to take the risk of opening up an administrative inbound port while having their entire enterprise on a public broadband format 
hackers  using simple port scanning tools  can easily locate these administrative inbound ports 
srm tm has the ability to monitor thousands of locations concurrently without opening an administrative inbound port and allows the secure  remote management and monitoring of multiple all in one gateway servers located worldwide 
this monitoring can be performed in real time  and from one or numerous central sites 
this technology also allows a network administrator to create a configuration template with all the configuration information and changes required for all in one units 
this template can be applied to each unit  all via a secure configuration mechanism from the central monitoring location  without compromising network security 
it is this srm tm system that forms the basis of the company s agreement with the general electric company 
the company s initial target markets are perimeter offices of fortune companies and small to medium size business requiring secure managed internet access

the decrease in sales of the company s internet products and services technology segment was primarily the result of reduced shipments to the company s major customer 
sales to this major customer were delayed largely as a result of requests by this customer that the company develop and add new failover technology to be utilized in future large scale deployments 
the company believes this additional feature will result in substantial additional benefits  since the feature added to its core products should assist the company in facilitating sales to other fortune companies 
the company intends to generate continuing revenue from the sale of its internet products and services in the coming year  including continuing revenue from this customer  including sales under its september agreement with general electric consumer finance

the increase in revenue in the technology segment is from shipments to its major customer within that segment 
additional sales to this major customer were delayed largely as a result of requests by this customer to add additional features in the products prior to delivery  including the embedding of third party software applications 
the company believes that the delay in delivery caused by adding these additional features will result in substantial additional benefits  since the features added to its core products should assist the company in facilitating sales to other fortune companies 
the company intends to generate continuing revenue from the sale of its internet products and services in the coming year  including continuing revenue from this customer  as the requested additional features  including new third party software applications  have now been added to its products so that the focus will be on the production and sale of its core technology

there were no cash flows from financing activities related to discontinued operations for the year ended june  post june  transactions on july  the company amended its certificate of incorporation  as authorized by its board of directors  by designating  shares of its  shares of preferred stock as series a convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share series a preferred stock 
cumulative dividends on the series a preferred stock will accrue at a rate of per annum from the date of issuance and will be payable annually in additional shares of the series a preferred stock 
each share of the series a preferred stock will be convertible at the time of the holders option into shares of the common stock an exercise price of per share 
holders of series a preferred stock will have voting rights on an as if converted basis and will vote as a single class with holders of the company s common stock 
through august   the company has issued  shares of its series a preferred stock for a total cash consideration of  the shares were issued in connection with a private offering of the company s securities pursuant to which shareholders also received warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock at an initial exercise price equal to per share 
five warrants were issued for each share of series a preferred stock one half warrant for each share of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock 
the warrants are exercisable for five years from the issuance date and are callable by the company if the closing price of the company s common stock is at or above three times the exercise price for consecutive trading days 
approximately  of the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock was utilized to purchase the outstanding capital stock of norstan network services  inc the company is seeking to sell additional shares of its series a preferred stock  the proceeds of which are intended to be used for working capital on july   the company received advances from certain individuals  some of whom are officers and directors of the company  aggregating  of which   was subsequently repaid 
the advances are non interest bearing  due on demand and have no scheduled repayment terms 
summary historically  the company s source of liquidity has been equity financing which is used to fund losses from operating activities 
netwolves had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  at june  and an additional million was received subsequent to june  as noted above 
in order for the company to execute its business plan  additional cash outflows are necessary for  among other things  continued development of technology  conducting customer pilot programs and increased sales efforts 
to the extent necessary  the company intends to utilize the expected operating profits of the recently acquired norstan network services  inc and raise additional monies from the sale of its capital stock to meet its funding needs over the next to months  however  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient capital to finance its operations 
if the company is unable to raise additional monies from the sale of its capital stock  or there is a reduction in the expected operating profits of norstan network services  inc  management will institute cost saving measures intended to significantly reduce its overhead expenses and curtail the operations of certain business segments 
however  even if the company does raise sufficient operating capital and norstan network services  inc continues to generate operating profits  there can be no assurances that the net proceeds will be sufficient to enable it to develop its business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
estimates have been made by management in several areas  including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as modified by statement of position and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding revenue recognition in the financial statements 
sop provides additional guidance with respect to multiple element arrangements  returns  exchanges  and platform transfer rights  resellers  services  funded software development arrangements  and contract accounting 
accordingly  revenue from the sale of hardware and perpetual and term software licenses are recognized  net of provisions for returns  at the time of delivery and acceptance of hardware and software products by the customer  when the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
maintenance or monitoring revenue that is bundled with an initial license fee is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance or monitoring period 
amounts deferred for maintenance or monitoring are based on the fair value of equivalent maintenance or monitoring services sold separately 
the company recognizes revenue from consulting and training fees when the services are provided 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to prepare our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at june  and obsolete inventory significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or excess 
during the year ended june   the company recorded a writedown of inventory approximating  caused by the substantial upgrades and improvements made by the company to its core products by discontinuing its foxbox line of u products with the introduction of its wolfpac security platform u product line item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk management does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
