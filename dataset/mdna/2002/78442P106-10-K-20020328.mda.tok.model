item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts overview on august   in accordance with the student loan marketing association reorganization act of the privatization act and approval by shareholders of an agreement and plan of reorganization  the student loan marketing association the gse was reorganized into a subsidiary of usa education  inc 
the reorganization 
usa education  inc 
is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including the gse 
references herein to the company refer to the gse and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the reorganization and to usa education  inc 
and its subsidiaries for periods after the reorganization 
usa education  inc 
will be renamed slm corporation effective may  the company is the largest private source of funding  delivery and servicing support for education loans in the united states primarily through its participation in the federal family education loan program ffelp  formerly the guaranteed student loan program 
the company s products and services include student loan purchases and commitments to purchase student loans  student loan servicing and collections  as well as operational support to originators of student loans and to post secondary education institutions  guarantors and other education related financial services 
the company also originates  purchases  holds and services non federally insured private loans 
the following management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and information that are based on management s current expectations as of the date of this document 
discussions that utilize the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate and expect and similar expressions  as they relate to the company s management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  changes in the terms of student loans and the educational credit marketplace arising from the implementation of applicable laws and regulations and from changes in such laws and regulations  which may reduce the volume  average term and costs of yields on student loans under the ffelp or result in loans being originated or refinanced under non ffelp programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and others agree to sell ffelp loans to the company 
the company could also be affected by changes in the demand for educational financing and consumer lending or in financing preferences of lenders  educational institutions  students and their families  changes in the general interest rate environment and in the securitization markets for education loans  which may increase the costs or limit the availability of financings necessary to initiate  purchase or carry education loans  losses from default  and changes in prepayment rates and credit spreads 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these accounting policies include securitization accounting  provision for loan losses  sales of floor revenue contracts and derivative accounting 
securitization accounting 
the company regularly engages in securitization transactions as part of its financing strategy 
when the company sells student loans to a securitization trust  it retains any excess residual cash flows residual interest  servicing rights  and in some cases  a cash reserve account  all of which are retained interests in the securitized receivables 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company transfers the financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
the gain or loss on securitization is based upon the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer and the fair value of the retained interest at the date of transfer 
the company estimates fair value  both initially and on a quarterly basis going forward  based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using management s best estimates of the key assumptions credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
provision for loan losses 
the allowance for student loan losses is established primarily through a charge to the provision for student loan losses 
provisions are made to the reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances principally for the company s non insured student loans 
the estimated losses are based on historical default rates by program type and are regularly evaluated by the company for adequacy by considering factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  changes in actual and forecasted default rates  and evaluating actual versus projected charge offs 
a large percentage of the company s non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
sales of floor revenue contracts 
management continually evaluates the projected balance of the student loan portfolio that contains an embedded option for earning additional income when short term interest rates fall below certain levels 
this evaluation primarily considers prepayment rates  projected volume through originations and purchases and default rates 
based on these projections  management enters into floor revenue contracts see student loan floor revenue contracts 
fluctuations in the value of such contracts are recorded currently in income 
if the estimates used in the projections differ materially from the actual portfolio balances  it could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
derivative accounting 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuation in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments that are used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps  interest rate futures contracts  and interest rate floor and cap contracts 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
most of the derivative contracts into which the company enters are effective economic hedges for its interest rate risk management strategy but are not effective hedges under sfas this results in the majority of these hedges being classified as trading for gaap purposes and therefore the resulting mark to market is included in gaap earnings 
mark to market values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
other accounting policies involve estimates  assumptions and judgments that  if varied  may cause actual results to be materially different from those reported

taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  increased by million while the net interest margin increased by basis points 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in  which led to an increase of million in floor income  and the billion increase in the average balance of student loans 
the net interest margin increase is reflective of the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets and the increase in floor income 
this is partially offset by the increase in the company s portfolio of lower yielding loans due to the acquisition of loans earlier in their life cycles which has decreased the average special allowance payment sap in the student loan yield

student loan income student loan cost of funds student loan spread off balance sheet servicing and securitization revenue average balances in millions of dollars on balance sheet student loans    securitized loans    managed student loans    the company s portfolio of student loans originated under the ffelp has a variety of unique interest rate characteristics 
the company generally earns interest at the greater of the borrower s rate or a floating rate determined by reference to the average of the applicable floating rates day treasury bill  commercial paper  week treasury bill  or the constant maturity treasury rate in a calendar quarter  plus a fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was originated 
if the resulting floating rate exceeds the borrower rate  the department of education pays the difference directly to the company 
this payment is referred to as sap 
if the resulting floating rate is less than the rate the borrower is obligated to pay  the company simply earns interest at the borrower rate 
in all cases  the rate the borrower pays sets a minimum rate for determining the yield the company earns on the loan 
borrowers interest rates are either fixed to term or are reset annually on july of each year depending on when the loan was originated 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average of the day treasury bill auctions  the commerical paper index  the week treasury bill  or the constant maturity treasury rate  either directly or through the use of derivative financial instruments intended to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans 
such borrowings in general  however  do not have minimum rates 
as a result  in certain declining interest rate environments  the portfolio of managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the company s funding costs exclusive of fluctuations in funding spreads will generally decline along with short term interest rates 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is fixed to term  lower interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is reset annually  any benefit of a low interest rate environment will only enhance student loan spreads through the next annual reset of the borrower s interest rates  which occurs on july of each year 
the effect of this enhanced spread is referred to as floor income 
low average treasury bill rates in benefited the company s on balance sheet student loan income  net of payments under floor revenue contracts see student loan floor revenue contracts  by million of which million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates fixed to term and million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates adjusting annually

the basis point increase in the student loan spread in versus is due primarily to the increase in floor income  attributable to lower short term interest rates 
the student loan spread in decreased by basis points from this was due mainly to the decrease in floor income  attributable to higher short term interest rates in the following table analyzes the ability of the ffelp student loans in the company s managed student loan portfolio to earn at the minimum borrower interest rate at december  and  based on the last treasury bill auction of the year percent in and percent in

student loan floor revenue contracts periodically  the company has entered into contracts with third parties to monetize the value of the minimum borrower interest rate feature of its portfolio of ffelp student loans 
under these contracts  referred to as floor revenue contracts  the company receives an upfront payment and agrees to pay the difference between the minimum borrower interest rate less the spread the strike rate and the average of the index over the period of the contract 
if the strike rate is less than the average of the index  then no payment is required 
prior to the implementation of sfas  these upfront payments were amortized over the average life of the contracts 
floor revenue contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is reset annually have historically had terms through the next reset date  a period of one year or less  while floor revenue contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term have multi year terms 
the billion of outstanding fixed borrower rate floor revenue contracts at december  have expiration dates through the year for the years ended december  and  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the sale of floor revenue contracts on the company s on balance sheet student loans with fixed borrower rates was million and million  respectively  and for floor revenue contracts with annually reset borrower rates was million and million  respectively 
effective december   in anticipation of the adoption of sfas  the floor revenue contracts were de designated as effective hedges and marked to market 
the net effect of the fair market value of these contracts and the unamortized upfront payment was a loss totaling million 
this loss was reclassified to student loan premium and is being amortized over the average life of the student loan portfolio 
at december   the unamortized balance related to the fair market value of these contracts in student loan premium totaled million 
for the year ended december   the related amortization totaled million  and the premium write off due to securitization totaled million 
since these contracts are no longer considered effective hedges for gaap  the company marks to market the floor revenue contracts 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million in pre tax  mark to market losses attributable to floor revenue contracts due to the implementation of sfas at december   the outstanding notional amount of floor revenue contracts totaled billion 
activity in the allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the portfolio of student loans 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for losses on its federally insured portfolio of student loans separately from its non federally insured portfolio 
for the federally insured portfolio  the company primarily considers trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors due to servicing defects as well as overall default rates on those ffelp student loans subject to the two percent risk sharing  ie  those loans that are insured as to percent of principal and accrued interest 
once a student loan is rejected for claim payment  the company s policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest 
due to the nature of the ffelp assets and the extensive collection efforts in which the company engages  the company currently writes off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years 
for the non federally insured portfolio of student loans  the company primarily considers recent trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  historical trends in loan volume by program  economic conditions and credit and underwriting policies 
a large percentage of the company s non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio 
an analysis of the company s allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table 
years ended december  balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses reserves acquired in acquisition other charge offs non federally insured loans federally insured loans total charge offs recoveries non federally insured loans federally insured loans total recoveries net charge offs reduction for sale of student loans balance at end of year allocation of the allowance for loan losses non federally insured loans federally insured loans total net charge offs as a percentage of average student loans 


total allowance as a percentage of average student loans 


non federally insured allowance as a percentage of the ending balance of non federally insured loans average student loans    ending student loans    the increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  versus december  of million is primarily attributable to the percent increase in volume of non federally insured student loans year over year 
as the volume of non federally insured loans increases and begins to age  the company obtains more historical data on default rates for these loans 
based on management s assumptions and on actual loan performance  the company re evaluates the requirements for its provision for loan losses 
in  non federally insured loan write offs increased by million over which is primarily attributable to the increased volume and aging of this portfolio 
these factors did not significantly impact the provision for loan losses in or on balance sheet funding costs the company s borrowings are generally variable rate indexed principally to the day treasury bill  commercial paper  week treasury bill  or the constant maturity treasury rate

in  the company completed four securitization transactions in which a total of billion of student loans were sold to a special purpose finance subsidiary and by that subsidiary to special purpose trusts that issued asset backed securities to fund the student loans to term 
in addition  the company acquired the securitization revenue streams of billion of student loans previously securitized by usa group 
in  the company completed three securitization transactions in which a total of billion of student loans were securitized 
the company accounts for its securitization transactions in accordance with sfas  which establishes the accounting for certain financial asset transfers  including securitization transactions 
under sfas  the company records a gain on sale based upon the difference between the cost basis of the assets sold and the fair value of the assets received 
as a result  the company records an asset  the residual interest  which approximates the present value of the expected net cash flows from the trust to the company over the life of the portfolio securitized 
in addition  the company continues to service the loans in the trusts through sallie mae servicing lp  formerly known as sallie mae servicing corporation  for a fee  and earns that fee over the life of the portfolio 
when the contract servicing fee is greater than current market servicing rates  the present value of such excess servicing fees is recognized as a servicing asset and amortized over the life of the portfolio serviced

the increase in the gain percentage in versus is principally due to lower financing spreads 
the increase in the gains and gain percentage in versus is due to increased volume and lower financing spreads  respectively 
gains on future securitizations will continue to vary depending on the size and the loan characteristics of the loan portfolios securitized and the funding costs prevailing in the securitization debt markets 
servicing and securitization revenue servicing and securitization revenue  the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools  includes both the revenue the company receives for servicing loans in the securitization trusts and the income earned on the residual interest asset

the airline industry has been in a state of uncertainty since the events of september  all payment obligations remain current and the company has not been notified of any counterparty s intention to default on any payment obligations 
in the event of default  any potential loss would be partially mitigated by recoveries on the sale of the aircraft collateral and elimination of expected tax liabilities reflected in the balance sheet of million and million at december  and  respectively 
any potential loss would be increased by incremental tax obligations related to forgiveness of debt obligations 
pro forma statements of income under gaap  the company s securitization transactions have been treated as sales 
at the time of sale  in accordance with sfas  the company records a gain which approximates the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the portfolios of loans sold 
interest earned on the residual interest and fees earned for servicing the loan portfolios are recognized over the life of the securitization transaction as servicing and securitization revenue 
income recognition is effectively accelerated through the recognition of a gain at the time of sale while the ultimate realization of such income remains dependent on the actual performance  over time  of the loans that were securitized 
most of the derivative contracts into which the company enters are effective economic hedges for its interest rate risk management strategy but are not effective hedges under sfas because they do not typically extend to the full term of the hedged item 
the majority of these hedges are treated as trading for gaap purposes and therefore the resulting mark to market is taken into gaap earnings 
in addition  sfas requires that the company mark to market its written options but none of its embedded options in its student loan assets 
effectively  in this case  sfas recognizes the liability but not the corresponding asset 
management believes that  in addition to results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap  another important performance measure is pro forma results of operations under the assumptions that the securitization transactions are financings and that the securitized student loans were not sold 
in addition  the effects of sfas are excluded from the pro forma results of operations and the economic hedge effects of derivative instruments are recognized 
the pro forma results of operations also exclude the benefit of floor income  certain gains and losses on sales of investment securities and student loans  a one time integration charge related to the july acquisition of usa group and the amortization and changes in market value of goodwill and intangible assets 
the following pro forma statements of income present the company s results of operations under these assumptions 
management refers to these pro forma results as core cash basis statements of income 
management monitors the periodic core cash basis earnings of the company s managed student loan portfolio and believes that they assist in a better understanding of the company s student loan business

student loan income cost of funds core cash basis student loan spread average balances managed student loans    while the company may earn floor income  depending on the interest rate environment  on its student loan portfolio see student loan spread analysis  these earnings are excluded from core cash basis results 
however  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the floor revenue contracts with fixed borrower rates is included as an addition to student loan income in the core cash basis results 
for the years ended december   and  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the floor revenue contracts with fixed borrower rates was million  million and million  respectively 
the basis point increase in the core cash basis student loan spread versus was mainly due to the company locking in floor revenue through term hedges and as a result of better funding spreads 
in addition  the core cash basis student loan spread increased due to higher yields on the student loan portfolio from the mix private loans versus federal loans and a higher percentage of federal loans in a repayment status 
in  core cash basis financing spreads  relative to the treasury bill  increased by basis points versus this was due to wider financing spreads in both the gse and securitization debt markets and to the higher percentage of the student loan portfolio being funded by the company s asset backed securities 
the company s asset backed securities have a higher cost of funds than the company s gse debt because they are term match funded and do not benefit from the gse s status 
the higher funding costs on the company s asset backed securities is partially mitigated by the absence of offset fees on securitized loans 
the net effect of increased funding costs and lower offset fees in versus was basis points 
in  net interest income  on a core cash basis  was billion compared with billion in and million in the increase in net interest income for the year ended december  versus the year ago period was due to the increase in the average balance of managed student loans of billion and the increase in the student loan spread 
the increase in net interest income in over is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of managed student loans 
core cash basis provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the managed portfolio of student loans 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for losses on its federally insured portfolio of managed student loans separately from its non federally insured portfolio 
for the federally insured portfolio  the company primarily considers trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors due to servicing defects as well as overall default rates on those ffelp student loans subject to the two percent risk sharing 
once a student loan is rejected for claim payment  the company s policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest 
due to the guaranteed nature of the ffelp assets and the extensive collection efforts in which the company engages  the company currently writes off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years 
for the non federally insured portfolio of student loans  the company primarily considers recent trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  historical trends in loan volume by program  economic conditions and credit and underwriting policies 
a large percentage of the company s non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio 
an analysis of the company s allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table

the core cash basis provision for loan losses includes million for potential loan losses on the non federally insured student loans and million for potential loan losses due to risk sharing and other claims on ffelp loans 
the core cash basis provision includes million for potential loan losses on the non federally insured portfolio and million for potential loan losses due to risk sharing and other claims on ffelp loans 
the provision and allowance for loan losses presented on a core cash basis are directly tied to the activity presented for the company s on balance sheet student loan portfolio 
the increased volume and aging of the company s non federally insured student loans and management s estimates as to their effects on the allowance for loan losses were the primary causes for the increase in the provision for loan losses of million in versus this increased volume and aging also contributed to the million increase in write offs in versus delinquencies non federally insured student loans the following table shows the loan delinquency trends for the years presented on the company s non federally insured student loan portfolio

core cash basis other income mainly includes guarantor servicing fees  late fees earned on student loans  fees received from servicing third party portfolios of student loans  and commitment fees for letters of credit

this loss has been excluded from core cash basis other income 
federal and state taxes the company s overall effective tax rate for the years ended december   and is percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the company maintains a portfolio of tax advantaged assets principally to support education related financing activities 
that portfolio was responsible for a decrease in the effective tax rate for the years ended december   and of two percent  two percent  and three percent  respectively 
the gse is exempt from all state  local and district of columbia income  franchise  sales and use  personal property and other taxes  except for real property taxes 
however  this tax exemption applies only to the gse and does not apply to usa education  inc or its other operating subsidiaries 
under the privatization act  the company s gse and non gse activities are separated  with non gse activities being subject to taxation at the state and local levels 
state taxes for the years ended december   and increased the company s effective tax rate by three percent  two percent and one percent  respectively 
as increasing business activity occurs outside of the gse  the impact of state and local taxes will increase accordingly 
ultimately all business activities will occur outside of the gse  which could increase the company s effective income tax rate by as much as five percentage points from the effective tax rate 
the loss of the gse tax exemption for sales and use and personal property taxes could increase operating costs by one percentage point 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s primary requirements for capital are to fund the company s operations  to purchase student loans and to repay its debt obligations while continuing to meet the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio test 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by the gse  off balance sheet financings through securitizations  borrowings under its commercial paper and medium term notes programs  other senior note issuances by the company  and cash generated by its subsidiaries operations and distributed through dividends to the company 
the company s borrowings are broken down as follows years ended december  average average average average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate gse    company  securitizations off balance sheet    total    gse financing activities the gse secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans  along with its other operations  by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets  through public offerings and private placements of us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics 
the gse s debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both moody s and s p 
historically  the agencies ratings of the gse have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise 
since the privatization act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the gse  management anticipates that the gse will retain its current credit ratings 
the gse s unsecured financing requirements are driven by three principal factors refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature  financing of student loan portfolio growth  and the level of securitization activity 
securitization activities in addition to the gse debt  student loan securitization has been an important source of funding for the company s managed student loan portfolio since as student loans are securitized and are removed from the balance sheet  the need for long term financing decreases 
over the long term  securitization is expected to provide the principal source of long term funding for the company s managed portfolio of student loans 
management believes that securitizations represent an efficient source of funding 
the company s asset backed securities generally have a higher cost of funds than its traditional on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded and do not benefit from the gse s status 
however  the increased funding costs of the asset backed securities are mitigated by the absence of the offset fees on securitized loans 
securitization also allows the company to obtain term financing at a lower cost than otherwise would be achievable without the gse s government sponsored status 
securitizations to date have been structured to achieve an aaa credit rating on over percent of its securities sold with an a credit rating on the remaining subordinated securities 
in  the company completed four securitization transactions totaling billion in student loans and an additional million through the recycling provisions of certain securitizations 
in both late and early  the russian bond default in august caused financing spreads on potential treasury bill indexed securitization transactions to be wider and thus more costly than previous years transactions 
as a result  the company did not enter into a securitization transaction from september through may of financial market conditions did improve to a point at which it was economical to securitize student loans  and in the second quarter of  the company reentered the asset backed securities market by completing a billion securitization 
in  the company completed three securitization transactions totaling billion in student loans 
during  demand for treasury bill securities remained high causing treasury bill rates to remain low relative to other market indices 
as a consequence  the company issued billion in libor based asset backed securities  the first issuances indexed to libor in the history of the program 
the company s and securitization transactions continue to be indexed to libor 
the company is managing this off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet financing activities  principally through basis swaps 
company financing activities in order to finance non gse activities and in preparation for the eventual wind down of the gse  usa education is developing additional financing vehicles 
while continued use of the securitization market will be the core of the company s financing strategy  these efforts will be supplemented by commercial paper  asset backed commercial paper  bank lines of credit  underwritten long term debt  and a medium term note program 
in the third quarter of  the company received credit ratings that will facilitate its access to the private funding markets short term debt ratings of a  f and p  and long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a  a and a were issued by s p  moody s and fitch ibca  inc  respectively 
upon receiving its initial credit ratings  the company initiated its commercial paper program 
effective october   the company renewed its million day revolving credit facility for an additional day period 
liquidity support for the company s commercial paper program is provided by this million day revolving credit facility which matures on october   and a million year revolving credit facility which matures on october  on october   the company issued million of its senior notes due september  during  the company issued an additional billion of long term notes under its medium term note program and other senior note offerings 
during  the company used the proceeds from student loan securitizations of billion  repayments and claim payments on student loans of billion  net proceeds from debt issuances of billion  and the net proceeds from sales of student loans to purchase student loans of billion 
operating activities provided net cash inflows of million in  an increase of million from the net cash inflows of million in during  the company issued billion of long term notes to refund maturing and repurchased obligations 
at december   the company had billion of outstanding long term debt issues of which billion had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions 
the company uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps collateralized where appropriate  purchases of us treasury securities and other hedging techniques to reduce its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations that arise from its financing activities and to match the variable interest rate characteristics of its earning assets 
see interest rate risk management 
gse wind down until the gse is dissolved  the privatization act places a number of limitations on the company 
under the privatization act  the gse must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september  the company has the option of effecting an earlier dissolution of the gse if certain conditions are met 
on january   the gse s board of directors approved management s plans to accelerate the wind down of the entity by at least two years  with a view to effecting dissolution of the gse no later than september  any gse debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust  consisting of us government or agency obligations with cash flows matching the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt 
the privatization act requires that on the dissolution date  the gse shall repurchase or redeem  or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock 
the gse redeemed its series a adjustable rate cumulative preferred stock  its only outstanding preferred stock  in the fourth quarter of also upon the gse s dissolution  all of its remaining assets will transfer to the company 
the privatization act effectively requires that the gse maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets plus percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items of at least percent or be subject to certain safety and soundness requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio 
while the gse may not finance the activities of its non gse affiliates  it may  subject to its minimum capital requirements  dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to usa education  inc  which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act requires management to certify to the secretary of the treasury that  after giving effect to the payment of dividends  the statutory capital ratio test would have been met at the time the dividend was declared 
at december   the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio  after the effect of the dividends to be paid in the first quarter of  was percent 
the gse has also received guidance from the us department of treasury s office of sallie mae oversight regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its wind down 
as a result  in connection with any dividend declarations  the gse will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula 
management does not expect the capital levels of the company s consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula 
the privatization act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the gse and its affiliates during the wind down period 
in particular  the gse must not extend credit to  nor guarantee  any debt obligations of usa education  inc or its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act provides that the gse may continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before september  the legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the gse s debt obligations  including the exemptions from sec registration and state taxes  will be fully preserved until their respective maturities 
such debt obligations will remain gse debt obligations  whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of  or issued subsequent to  the reorganization 
the obligations of usa education  inc do not have gse status 
interest rate risk management interest rate gap analysis the company s principal objective in financing its operations is to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by matching the interest rate characteristics of its borrowings to specific assets in order to lock in spreads 
the company funds its floating rate managed loan assets most of which have weekly rate resets with variable rate debt and fixed rate debt converted to variable rates with interest rate swaps 
the company also uses interest rate cap agreements  foreign currency swaps  options on securities  and financial futures contracts to further reduce interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure on certain of its borrowings 
investments are funded on a pooled approach  ie  the pool of liabilities that funds the investment portfolio has an average rate and maturity or reset date that corresponds to the average rate and maturity or reset date of the investments which they fund 
in addition to term match funding at december   billion of the company s asset backed securities match the interest rate characteristics of the majority of the student loans in the trusts by being indexed to the day treasury bill 
at december   there were approximately billion of plus student loans outstanding in the trusts  which have interest rates that reset annually based on the final auction of week treasury bills before each july in addition  at december   there were approximately billion of asset backed securities indexed to libor 
in its securitization transactions  the company retains this basis risk and manages it within the trusts through its on balance sheet financing and hedging activities 
the effect of this basis risk management is included in the following table as the impact of securitized student loans 
in the table below the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index 
fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates 
an interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals

interest rate sensitivity analysis while the company follows a policy to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding its floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt  in low interest rate environments  the student loan portfolio earns at a minimum fixed interest rate 
during  the company was in a low interest environment where the student loans were earning at a fixed minimum rate  while the funding costs for these loans continued to decrease 
the company chose to lock in a portion of the income associated with this mismatch through the use of futures and swap contracts 
the result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt  matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans during the low interest rate environment 
therefore  in certain low interest rate environments  the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability is fixed 
if interest rates rise dramatically  then rates earned on the student loan asset will reach a point where it will become floating again 
for those student loans where the fixed loan rate in low interest rate environments was economically hedged by fixed rate funding through the use of derivatives  a higher spread will be earned in a high interest rate environment 
the impact of the dramatic increase in rates on the hedging positions described above resulted in an approximate million increase to earnings in the scenario in which interest rates are increased by basis points for the year ended december  the positions were not effective in the year the effect of short term movements in interest rates on the company s results of operations and financial position has been limited through the company s risk management activities 
the following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended december  and and the effect on fair values at december  and based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by the company assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remained constant 
the company has chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates  as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements 
the effect on earnings was performed on the company s variable rate assets  liabilities  and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on the company s fixed rate assets  liabilities  and hedging instruments
