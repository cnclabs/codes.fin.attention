item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements any statements we set forth in this annual report or otherwise made in writing or orally with regard to our goals for revenues  cost reductions and return on capital  execution of our business model in a timely manner  expectations as to industry conditions and our financial results and cash flow  demand for or pricing of our products  margin enhancement  retention of key accounts  income growth  market penetration  development of new products and new and existing markets for our products  environmental matters  implementation of our integrated information technology platform  our ability to identify and execute future acquisitions which will enhance both our business growth and return on capital and other aspects of our business may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
accordingly  we identify the following important factors  among others  which could cause our results to differ from any results which might be projected  forecasted or estimated in any such forward looking statements i variations in demand for or pricing of our products  ii our ability to identify  finance and consummate future alliances or acquisitions  iii our ability to develop new  high value added engineered products  iv our ability to realize cost reductions pursuant to our drive project and changes to business processes contemplated by our impact project  v changes in the cost or availability of raw materials we use  in particular market pulp  pulp substitutes and wastepaper  and changes in energy related costs  vi changes in industry paper production capacity  including the construction of new mills  the closing of mills and incremental changes due to capital expenditures or productivity increases  vii the gain or loss of significant customers and or on going viability of such customers  viii cost and other effects of environmental compliance  cleanup  damages  remediation or restoration  or personal injury or property damage related thereto  such as costs associated with the notices of violation novs issued by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pennsylvania dep  the costs of natural resource restoration or damages related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in the lower fox river on which our neenah mill is located and the effect of complying with the wastewater discharge limitations of the spring grove mill permit  ix enactment of adverse state  federal or foreign legislation or changes in government policy or regulation  x adverse results in litigation  xi fluctuations in currency exchange rates  xii disruptions in production and or increased costs due to labor disputes  and xiii our ability to enter into a new debt facility 
significant and subjective estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments and derivative financial instruments  long lived assets  and contingencies  including environmental matters 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the most significant and subjective estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain reserves for expected sales returns and allowances based principally on our return practices and our historical experience 
if actual sales returns differ from the estimated return rates projected  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves for sales returns and allowances  which could affect our reported income 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make required payments 
if customer payments were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our allowances for doubtful accounts  which could affect our reported income 
we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventories to reflect our inventory at the lower of its stated cost or market value 
our estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those we have projected  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  which could affect our reported income 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  equipment and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our evaluations include analyses based on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets  profitability information  including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of an asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans require various assumptions  including but not limited to  discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation growth rates 
our retiree medical plans also require various assumptions  which include but are not limited to  discount rates and annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of health care benefits 
we evaluate these assumptions at least once each year and make changes as conditions warrant 
changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported income  which will result in changes to the assets and liabilities associated with our benefit plans 
we maintain accruals for losses associated with environmental obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing legislation and remediation technologies 
these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation actions continue and or further legal or technical information develops 
such undiscounted liabilities are exclusive of any insurance or other claims against third parties 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties  including insurance carriers  are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 
overview we classify our sales into two product groups specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
the glatfelter division  which includes the spring grove  pennsylvania and neenah  wisconsin paper mills  produces both specialized printing and engineered papers 
the schoeller hoesch division s h includes paper mills in gernsbach  germany and scaer  france 
s h produces specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
we are in the process of changing our organization and information systems to manage our business in three separate business units engineered products  printing and converting papers and long fiber and overlay papers 
our information systems do not currently provide the information necessary for reporting by business unit 
such information is expected to be available by the end of overall demand for our products was fairly stable throughout of our two product groups  specialized printing papers typically are more influenced by the impact of changes in economic conditions 
during  this portion of our business experienced some decline in demand and a resulting decrease in sales volume and some selling price concessions 
despite this weakness  we had some successes during  including an increase in shipments for our book publishing papers in a year when overall industry shipments were down significantly 
the current outlook for our specialized printing papers is for demand to remain weak throughout the first and second quarters of we believe that some improvement in conditions could occur in the third quarter of our engineered papers tend to be less influenced by changing economic conditions 
demand for these products  excluding tobacco papers  remained fairly stable during and overall sales volume increases were realized 
pricing also remained fairly stable  although some price reductions did occur in selected markets 
our current outlook for these products is for stability to continue until mid year  with the potential for improved conditions thereafter 
after several years of declining market conditions  demand for our tobacco papers continued to weaken during the first half of in may  we announced our intent to sell the ecusta division as the tobacco papers market was no longer compatible with our strategic direction see unusual items below 
as part of the sale  which was completed on august   we entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the ecusta division 
under this agreement  which expires mid year  we will continue the manufacture and sale of tobacco papers at our gernsbach  germany facility exclusively for the buyer 
this agreement allows us to transition our product mix from tobacco papers to other engineered products  more specifically to long fiber and overlay papers 
see capital resources below for a description of capital spending related to this transition 
we have defined our vision to become the global supplier of choice in specialty papers and engineered products and established goals to achieve revenue of billion by with a sustainable average return on capital employed roce of 
despite our best efforts  economic conditions that have adversely affected our industry for the last several years have inhibited our progress in reaching our roce goal 
in addition  a lack of external growth opportunities and the sale of our ecusta division have hindered our ability to achieve our revenue growth target 
therefore  it is doubtful that we will be able to achieve these financial goals in the foreseeable future 
compared to overall  net sales in decreased  or  compared to excluding the ecusta division  net sales in decreased  or  compared to due to a decrease in average net selling prices  which were slightly offset by a net sales volume increase of 
average net selling prices decreased primarily due to lower prices because of weaker economic conditions  as well as a weaker mix of products sold and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
the following net sales analysis for both product groups  specialized printing papers and engineered products  excludes the results of the ecusta division 
net sales of specialized printing papers were lower in than in by due principally to a decrease in average net selling prices in addition to a decrease in net sales volume of 
the decreased average net selling prices resulted almost entirely from lower pricing as product mix remained relatively stable 
net sales of engineered papers excluding tobacco papers increased by in versus  as a increase in net sales volume was partially offset by a decrease in average net selling prices 
lower average net selling prices were due chiefly to reduced prices  as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and a weaker mix of products sold 
the cost of products sold decreased  or  in compared to excluding the ecusta division  cost of products sold decreased by  or 
cost of products sold was lower in versus primarily due to lower market pulp prices  savings from our drive initiative see drive and impact projects below and increased pension income 
pension income  which is non cash  reduced cost of products sold by  in compared to  in partially offsetting such cost reductions were higher energy costs for see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our retirement plans  including pension income 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  in over excluding the ecusta division  sg a expenses increased by  net of changes in pension income  or  from to  which was due primarily to increased salaries and professional fees related to building our capabilities to effectively implement our strategic initiatives 
pension income  which is non cash  reduced sg a expense by  in versus  in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gain from property dispositions  etc 
net for increased to  from  in in the third quarter of  we sold a acre tract of land for which we received  in net cash proceeds resulting in a realized pre tax gain of approximately  no significant sales of such properties occurred in from time to time  we divest certain tracts of our timberlands when we are offered attractive prices 
while we do not actively solicit the sale of our timberlands  we are currently evaluating our overall timberland strategy 
earnings excluding unusual items before interest income and expense and taxes were  in compared to  in excluding the ecusta division  earnings excluding unusual items before interest income and expense and taxes decreased by  or 
this was due to higher sg a expenses and a lower gross margin  which were partially offset by higher gains from property dispositions  etc 
net 
interest on investments and other net declined slightly in from from  to  primarily due to lower interest rates in compared to while higher average cash balances nearly offset such lower interest rates in interest on debt was  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower average borrowings 
additionally  a stronger us dollar relative to the deutsche mark dm during caused lower reported interest expense from dm denominated debt 
compared to overall  net sales in increased  or  compared to though net sales volume was higher in versus  the majority of the net sales increase was due to a increase in average net selling price 
sales of specialized printing papers were higher in than by  primarily due to a increase in average net selling prices resulting from improved pricing and product mix 
increased demand for these papers resulted in increased net sales volume of 
sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers fell by in versus  as an decrease in net sales volume was slightly offset by a increase in average net selling price 
the decrease in sales of engineered papers was largely due to a decrease in net sales of tobacco papers 
the majority of this decrease was due to a decrease in net sales volume 
the remainder results from a decrease in average price 
this decrease in sales was in large part a result of our announcement of tobacco papers selling price increases 
as we expected  subsequent to the announcement  some of our tobacco papers customers sought other suppliers 
during the year  ecusta division tobacco paper sales declined by approximately compared to the cost of products sold increased by in compared to with energy costs abnormally high and market pulp price increases uncharacteristically outpacing selling price increases  we would have expected cost of products sold from to to have increased more than the net sales increase 
pension income  which is non cash  reduced cost of products sold by  in compared to  in in addition  implementation of the drive project reduced cost of products sold 
primarily as a result of the increase in pension income and cost savings associated with the drive project  gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  in versus was due primarily to increased spending on outside consulting services relating to our drive and impact projects 
gain from property dispositions  etc 
net for decreased to about half of the gain from  to  in the first quarter of  we sold a acre tract of timberland for  in cash resulting in a realized gain of  during the remainder of  we sold various fully depreciated items  in addition to the rights to standing timber on select tracts of land 
subsequent to the first quarter of  no single sale was material to our results of operations 
no significant sales of such properties occurred in earnings before interest income and expense and taxes were  excluding the unusual item in compared to  in this increase was driven primarily by improved profit margins at the glatfelter and s h divisions as increased sales volume spread fixed costs over a greater number of tons produced and sold 
the ecusta division experienced lower sales volume  which decreased profit margins  thus partially negating the gains of the other divisions 
the strengthening of the us dollar with respect to the dm in also adversely affected earnings as foreign profits translated into fewer dollars 
finally  savings from our drive project contributed to profits  but such savings were offset by the effects of a weaker economy as well as additional consulting costs incurred in interest on investments and other net nearly doubled in from from  to  our average cash holdings in were significantly higher than in  yielding higher interest income 
additionally  cash was invested in higher yielding debt instruments throughout as compared to interest on debt was  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower average borrowings  offset partially by higher interest rates 
such lower average borrowings were related to an decrease in short term debt stemming from payments made 
additionally  a stronger us dollar relative to the dm during caused lower reported interest expense 
unusual items on may   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell our ecusta facility and two of its operating subsidiaries ecusta division 
because our board of directors had committed to a plan to dispose of the ecusta division by accepting an offer to sell the division  subject to certain closing conditions  at a loss  on that date the assets of the ecusta division were reclassified as assets held for disposal  and thus the carrying amount of these assets was reduced to fair value 
the decision to sell the ecusta division was made due to the determination that the business of the ecusta division  principally tobacco papers  did not fit with our long term strategic plans 
on august   we completed the sale of the ecusta division including plant and equipment  inventory  accounts receivable and essentially all other operating assets and certain other receivables related to our tobacco papers business 
the carrying value of the ecusta division totaled  after we recorded an impairment write down of  in the second quarter to reflect the fair value of the ecusta division 
these assets were sold for  plus the assumption by the buyer of certain liabilities totaling  related to the ecusta division s business 
the liabilities assumed by the buyer included accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities related to the operation of the ecusta division s business 
our total charge to earnings associated with the sale was  including the  impairment charge recognized during the second quarter of the  pre tax charge included  in transaction and other costs incurred upon sale of the ecusta division 
of this amount  approximately  related to transaction costs 
the remainder related to certain liabilities accrued related to the transaction 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we are obligated to incur costs in the future related to certain long term liabilities related to employee benefits  and facility maintenance  which would not have been necessary had we retained ownership interest in the ecusta division but were agreed to in order to consummate the transaction 
the  pre tax charge was net of a  pre tax gain related to the curtailment and settlement of pension obligations and other retiree benefits related to employees who transferred to the buyer 
the ecusta division contributed approximately  in operating profit during until its sale in august  had an operating loss of approximately  during and contributed approximately  in operating profit during we also recognized a  pre tax charge during the second quarter of related to the settlement of an environmental matter in connection with the spring grove facility s wastewater discharge permit 
the total unusual items recorded in were  during the first quarter of  we finalized our restructuring plan and shortly thereafter began to reduce the workforce at ecusta 
the workforce reduction was completed during the first quarter of and resulted in the reduction of over salaried and hourly jobs associated with our tobacco paper production capacity 
we accrued and charged to expense   after tax in the first quarter of primarily as a result of the voluntary portion of this restructuring  specifically salaried employees 
of this amount   related to enhanced pension benefits to be paid out of our retirement plans as discussed in our disclosure of retirement and other post retirement benefits 
the remaining  of this charge related to severance and other employee benefits to be paid using our assets 
approximately  of these liabilities were transferred to the buyer of the ecusta division 
unpaid amounts as of december  are expected to be paid by the end of drive and impact projects as of november   we completed the implementation of cost reduction programs designed to realize  at our current operations of annual cash cost savings identified during our on going drive project 
our employees generated over  cost savings ideas under drive of which over ideas were identified for implementation 
drive ideas included  among others  procurement initiatives and production process improvements to reduce the cost of raw materials  efficiency increases to improve paper machine speeds and quality yields  energy conservation programs and the outsourcing of our sheeting operation at the neenah  wisconsin facility 
because of the complex and highly integrated nature of our operations and the number of projects implemented  it is extremely difficult and cost prohibitive to determine the actual amount of cost savings realized 
we do recognize  however  that upon completing the implementation of the drive project  realized cost reductions have been largely offset by increases in on going operating costs such as wages and salaries  fringe benefits  energy costs and professional and other costs 
we continue to review our manufacturing processes for opportunities to improve efficiencies and effectiveness 
our impact project is focused on identifying and implementing changes in our organization and business processes 
we are currently in the second phase of impact  which includes the installation of an enterprise resource planning system 
this system  which will provide a common platform for purchasing  accounts payable  sales orders  cost accounting and general ledgers  among other things  is planned to be implemented at our us based locations during the second quarter of installation at our larger european locations will be completed in the fall of total spending on the impact project is expected to be approximately  of which approximately  is capital related 
through december   we have capitalized approximately  on the impact project 
the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system requires significant and pervasive change and thus subjects our business to significant implementation risk 
based on our progress to date  we believe we will complete an effective implementation within budget and without a material adverse impact on our business 
liquidity during  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  principally due to cash used in financing activities and investing activities of  and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities was mainly for dividend payments and net payment of debt 
cash used in investing activities was for additions to plant  equipment and timberlands  partially offset by cash provided from net proceeds from the sale of the ecusta division see unusual items 
cash used in investing and financing activities was partially offset by cash provided by operations of  our consolidated statement of cash flows cash flow statement for reflects the pre tax loss on the disposition of the ecusta division as an unusual item 
changes in the ecusta division s assets and liabilities  with the exception of taxes  are not reflected as changes in assets and liabilities in the cash flow statement 
the significant decreases reflected in our consolidated balance sheet balance sheet related to accounts receivable  inventory  plant  equipment and timberlands net and current liabilities from december  to december  are primarily due to the disposition of the ecusta division 
we expect to meet all our near and long term cash needs from a combination of internally generated funds  cash  cash equivalents and our existing revolving credit facility or other bank lines of credit and other long term debt 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility and are in compliance with all such covenants 
as the revolving credit facility matures on december   it has been reclassified on the balance sheet to current portion of long term debt 
as of december   we had  of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and an additional  was available under our revolving credit facility 
we intend to repay the revolving credit facility during using a portion of our cash and cash equivalents as well as through borrowings under a new debt facility to be negotiated 
interest rate risk we use our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of our notes to finance a significant portion of our operations 
the revolving credit facility provides for variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the euro london interbank offered rate 
we use interest rate swap agreements to partially hedge interest rate exposure associated with the revolving credit facility 
all of our derivative financial instrument transactions are entered into for non trading purposes 
to the extent that our financial instruments expose us to interest rate risk and market risk  they are presented in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity for our revolving credit facility  and notes and other long term debt as of december  for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents notional amounts and the related reference interest rates by year of maturity 
fair values included herein have been determined based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  and estimates obtained from dealers to settle interest rate swap agreements

the new century project will also require an estimated  and  in spending during and  respectively 
the total capital spending on the new century project is expected to be approximately  including  that was spent during preliminary phases prior to other significant capital expenditures expected during include  to begin the expansion of our long fiber and overlay papers capacity in gernsbach and  to begin the expansion of our abaca pulp making capacity in the philippines 
capital expenditures of  are expected on these projects in in our form k  we estimated our total capital expenditures to be  actual spending was less than that amount due to the cancellation and delay of certain projects

 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  in june and issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in august sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations occurring after june  and requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and establishes revised reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  we no longer amortize goodwill unless evidence of impairment exists  goodwill will be evaluated on at least an annual basis 
as of december  and using the foreign exchange translation rates  we had  in unamortized goodwill and recorded  in goodwill amortization expense in we adopted sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
we will adopt sfas no 
on january  we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and establishes new guidelines for the valuation of long lived assets

on january  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from regulation by various federal  state  local and foreign governmental authorities with respect to the environmental impact of our mills 
to comply with environmental laws and regulations  we have incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures in past years 
during  and  we incurred approximately   and  respectively  in operating costs related to complying with environmental laws and regulations 
we anticipate that environmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations will continue  and perhaps increase  in the future 
in addition  we may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment allegedly resulting from our operations  including the restoration of natural resources  and liability for personal injury and for damages to property and natural resources 
in particular  we remain open to negotiations with the epa and the pennsylvania dep regarding the novs under the federal and state air pollution control laws 
in addition  we continue to negotiate with the state of wisconsin and the united states regarding natural resources damages and response costs related to the discharge of pcbs and other hazardous substances in the lower fox river  on which our neenah facility is located 
we have settled with the pennsylvania dep and with the pennsylvania public interest research group and several other parties collectively pennpirg regarding the wastewater discharge permit for our spring grove facility 
under this settlement  we agreed to the implementation of certain projects encompassed by the new century project consistent with the time table set forth in our water discharge permit  requiring completion of the project by april this settlement also required a one time  pre tax charge of  during the second quarter of we are also voluntarily cooperating with an investigation by the pennsylvania dep  which commenced in february of our spring grove facility related to certain discharges  which are alleged to be unpermitted  to the codorus creek 
the costs associated with environmental matters are presently unknown but could be substantial and perhaps exceed our available resources 
our current assessment is that we should be able to manage these environmental matters without a long term  material adverse impact 
these matters could  however  at any particular time or for any particular year or years  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations or could result in a default under our loan covenants 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to these matters  that our share of costs and or damages for these matters will not exceed our available resources  or that such obligations will not have a long term  material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
with regard to the lower fox river and the bay of green bay  if we are not successful in managing the matter and are ordered to implement the remedy set forth in the proposed remedial action plan issued by the state of wisconsin and the united states  such order would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity and results of operations and would result in a default under our loan covenants 
we have accrued an amount to cover this matter which represents our best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
changes to the accrual reflect our best estimate of the ultimate outcome and considers changes in the extent and cost of the remedy  the status of negotiations with the various parties  including other prps  and our assessment of potential nrd claims  claims for reimbursement of expenses of other parties and residual liabilities 
for further discussion  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
environmental achievements we continue to strive for iso certification for our environmental management system as a component of our commitment to environmental excellence 
iso requires that an organization have an environmental policy that includes commitments to prevention of pollution  compliance with environmental laws and regulations and continual improvements in its environmental management systems 
our spring grove  pennsylvania  neenah  wisconsin and gernsbach  germany facilities are already iso certified 
as a part of maintaining our certification  each facility s environmental management system is audited by an independent third party on an ongoing  periodic basis 
we plan to have our scaer  france facility iso certified by the end of on april   we announced our new century project 
the new century project is our commitment to participate at our spring grove facility in epa s advanced technology incentive program under the cluster rules 
as described in the capital resources section above  we expect to spend approximately  prior to april to eliminate the use of elemental chlorine in our bleaching process  reduce odor emissions and improve water quality 
the new century project demonstrates our commitment to minimizing our impact on natural resources
