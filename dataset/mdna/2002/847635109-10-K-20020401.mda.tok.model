item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in this report which express belief  anticipation or expectation as well as other statements which are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those listed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
examples of these uncertainties and risks include  but are not limited to whether our products in development will prove feasible  safe and effective  whether and when we or our strategic partners will obtain approval from the fda and corresponding foreign agencies  our need to achieve manufacturing scale up in a timely manner  and our need to provide for the efficient manufacturing of sufficient quantities of our products  the lack of immediate alternate sources of supply for some critical components of our products  our patent and intellectual property position  the need to fully develop the marketing  distribution  customer service and technical support and other functions critical to the success of our product lines  the effectiveness and ultimate market acceptance of our products  and the dependence on our strategic partners for funding  development assistance  clinical trials  distribution and marketing of many of our products 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated on october   and since that date we raised capital through the sale of preferred stock  issuance of debt securities  public and private sales of common stock and funding from collaborative arrangements 
following our initial funding in early  we immediately began research and development activities with the objective of commercializing less invasive diagnostic  screening and monitoring products 
as part of our business strategy  we have established arrangements with leading medical device companies for the development  commercialization and introduction of some of our products 
we have entered into collaborative arrangements with respironics for our infant jaundice product  with welch allyn for our cancer detection product  with abbott for our glucose monitoring products  and with roche for our diabetes detection product 
in december  we sublicensed specified technology to and acquired a interest in fluorrx  inc  a delaware corporation formed for the purpose of developing and commercializing technology related to fluorescence spectroscopy 
at december   as a result of subsequent financings  our interest in fluorrx was 
in december  we acquired of the common stock of sterling medivations  inc  a company formed for the purpose of developing and marketing insulin delivery products 
we have a limited operating history upon which our prospects can be evaluated 
our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry 
this industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants  intense competition and a high failure rate 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception  and  as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of about million 
to date  we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts 
we first generated revenues from product sales in  but do not have significant experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling our products 
our development efforts may not result in commercially viable products  and we may not be successful in introducing our products 
moreover  required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  or at all 
our products may not ever gain market acceptance  and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the development and commercialization of our products will require substantial development  regulatory  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other expenditures 
we expect our operating losses to continue through at least as we continue to expend substantial resources to introduce our simple choice product line  complete development of our products  obtain regulatory clearances or approvals  build our marketing  sales  manufacturing and finance organizations and conduct further research and development 
we expect that most of our near term revenues will come from our sales of our new diabetes product line acquired from sterling medivations 
in addition  we expect to receive revenues that will be derived from royalties and manufacturing profits that we will receive from abbott and respironics resulting from sales of the products for which we have collaborative arrangements with each of these companies 
the royalties and manufacturing profits that we expect to receive from each of our collaborative partners depend on sales of these products 
we and our collaborative partners may not be able to sell sufficient volumes of our products to generate substantial revenues or profits for us 
we have entered into collaborative arrangements with respironics  welch allyn  abbott and roche 
the agreements evidencing these collaborative arrangements grant a substantial amount of discretion to each collaborative partner 
if one or more of our collaborative partners were to terminate their arrangement with us  we would either need to reach agreement with a replacement collaborative partner or undertake  at our own expense  the activities previously handled by our collaborative partner 
this would require us to develop expertise we do not currently possess  would significantly increase our capital requirements and would limit the programs we could pursue 
we would likely encounter significant delays in introducing our products  and the development  manufacture and sales of our products would be adversely affected by the absence of collaborative arrangements 
critical accounting policies the material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
because we are still early in our enterprise development  the number of these policies requiring explanation are limited 
as we begin to generate increased revenue from different sources  we expect that the number of applicable policies and complexity of the judgments required will increase 
currently our policies that could require critical management judgment are in the areas of revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accruals of product warranties and inventory valuation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of products or services upon shipment of products or services 
we also recognize milestone revenue from our collaborative partners when a milestone has been accomplished or when we and our partner agree that a milestone is earned  which may require management s judgement in the case of a disagreement between us and a collaborative partner 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses from the inability of our customers or subsidiaries to make required payments  and periodically review the payment history of each of our customers or subsidiaries  as well as their financial condition  and revise our reserves as a result 
accruals of product warranties we recognize a cost for warranty work on each of our products at the time of sale and match actual warranty work against that accrual  as the work is performed 
we periodically review the level of warranty accrual and the actual warranty work incurred and adjust these as needed 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
results of operations comparison of and general 
loss available to common stockholders increased to about million  or per share in from about million  or per share in the increased loss was due primarily to a million decrease in milestone payments received from collaborative partners in as compared to milestone payments received in this was offset by an increase in expense reimbursements from our collaborative partners in as compared to reimbursements in of about million 
we expect net losses to continue 
if we are unable to attain specific milestones under collaborative agreements  our collaborative partners may not make milestone payments under  or may terminate altogether  the agreements 
if this were to happen  future net losses would increase as a result of spending increases necessary to complete research  development and clinical trials of our products  begin sales and marketing efforts and establish manufacturing capabilities  with respect to the products covered by the collaborative agreements 
this would delay some of our product development activities 
in addition  we expect net losses to continue as we begin sales and marketing efforts and establish marketing capabilities for our simple choice product line 
revenue and cost of product sales 
total revenues decreased to about million in from about million in the decrease was solely due to a decrease in milestone payments  other than equity purchases  received from collaborative partners  which decreased to  in from about million in product sales increased approximately to million in from about million in revenues related to the bilichek product line increased approximately for the year 
cost of product sales did not exceed product revenue for the first time in  and again in  but at a relatively low margin as we are in the early stages of product introduction 
cost of product sales increased to about million in from about million in cost of product sales was reduced by about  in due to an agreement with a collaborative partner to reimburse us for excess capacity 
also in  we took a one time write off of obsolete tooling of about  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to about million in from about million in primarily due to an increase of about million in expense reimbursements from our collaborative partners  particularly reimbursements from abbott relating to our continuous glucose monitoring product 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we develop products associated with our current products and the simple choice insulin delivery products acquired with sterling medivations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to about  in from about  in the decrease in expense was due to a decrease in travel and related expenses incurred in relating to establishing distribution outlets for our bilichek product line and a reduction of costs associated with marketing materials for those distribution channels 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as we prepare to market and sell our simple choice product line acquired from sterling medivations 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased from about million for from about million in the decrease resulted from more favorable rates on insurance of approximately  a reduction of allowances on uncollectables due to a much higher percentage of collections on receivables than originally anticipated  and a reduction of legal expenses associated with litigation during as compared to net interest income and other expense 
net interest income and other expense decreased to about  in from about  in although we did maintain higher cash balances in as compared to  the decrease is directly attributed to the reduction in interest rates experienced during comparison of and general 
loss available to common stockholders increased to about million  or 
per share  in from about million  or 
per share  in this increased loss was due primarily to increases in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
revenues and cost of product sales 
revenues increased to about million in from about million in the increase was both in revenue from product sales and milestones from collaborative partners 
the primary reason product sales increased was that our bilichek product line grew to about million in revenue from collaborative agreements  which is generally in the form of milestone payments increased to about million in from about million in  million of the milestones were received from abbott for our continuous glucose monitoring program 
cost of product sales were about million in  unchanged from million in all cost of sales are related to product sales 
those costs did not exceed sales revenues for the first time in  but at a relatively low margin  because we are in the early stages of product introduction and have excess capacity 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to about million in from about million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in employee costs of  costs of prototype materials of  temporary help and consulting costs of  royalty expenses of  primarily related to the initiatives in continuous glucose monitoring and cancer detection  internal and external clinical costs of  for our infant jaundice and diabetes detection products 
research and development costs increases were offset by an increase of reimbursements by our collaborative partners of about million 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to about  in from about  in the increase was due primarily to increases in marketing materials of  and consulting costs for latin and south america of  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to about million in from about million in the increase in general and administrative expense was due to the increases in legal fees of  compensation costs of  recruiting costs of  and costs of contractual agreements of  the increase in legal fees is primarily due to expenses incurred for the altea arbitration and other activities to protect our intellectual property 
net interest income and other expense 
net interest and other income increased to about  for the year ended december  from  in this increase results primarily from interest received on higher average cash balances in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of our debt and equity securities and the public sale of our common stock 
from october   our date of inception  through december   we received about million in net proceeds from sales of our debt and equity securities 
at december   we had cash of about million and working capital of about million 
we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on july   which resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of about million 
in november  we received million from our sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock to abbott in conjunction with an amendment to our agreement with abbott for research and development of our glucose monitoring technology 
in january  we received an additional million from of our sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock to abbott  and in february  we received million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction 
in june  we received million from our sales of an aggregate of about million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase about  shares of common stock to affiliates of safeco corporation and special situations fund in private placement transactions 
in october  we received million from our sales of about  shares of common stock to abbott in connection with a milestone under a program to commercialize our continuous glucose monitoring technology for people with diabetes 
we also received funds in from grants related to our development programs 
in september  we received a grant of  from the centers for disease control for our continuous glucose monitoring product  and in july  we received a  grant from the national cancer institute for our cervical cancer product 
our major cash flows in consisted of cash out flow of million from operations  offset by the cash in flow of million of private placement financing net of transaction costs 
in addition to funds that we expect to be provided by our collaborative partners  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we will need additional funds as compared to prior years to implement the introduction of the simple choice product line 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements through however  these resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations to the point of commercial introduction of our glucose monitoring product our cervical cancer product or our full line of diabetes products 
we currently invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term  investment grade  interest bearing obligations until the funds are used in operations 
substantial capital will be required to develop our products  including completing product testing and clinical trials  obtaining all required fda and foreign regulatory approvals and clearances  beginning and scaling up manufacturing and marketing our products 
any failure of our collaborative partners to fund our development expenditures or our inability to obtain financing from other sources would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
