from inception  the company relied primarily on independent contract manufactures located primarily in the far east 
commencing in the third quarter of and taking advantage of the north american free trade agreement nafta  the company substantially expanded its use of independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors in mexico  primarily for basic garments 
since  the company has engaged in an ambitious program to develop a vertically integrated manufacturing operation in mexico 
the gross sale of products sourced in mexico was approximately million in or of net sales compared to approximately million in or of net sales 
in addition  the company has maintained its sourcing operation from the far east 
the vertical integration of its manufacturing operations through the development and acquisition of fabric and production capacity in mexico concluded in in addition  the company focused on coordinating and improving the efficiencies of its operations throughout the year 
the company believes that the dual strategy of maintaining independent contract manufacturers in the far east and a company controlled manufacturing network in mexico can best serve the different needs of its customers and enable it to take the best advantage of both markets 
in addition  the company believes it has diversified its business risks associated with doing business abroad including transportation delays  economic or political instability  currency fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of tariffs  export duties  quota  and other trade restrictions 
major apparel retailers are increasingly outsourcing apparel merchandise management programs to minimize inventory risks  to increase profitability and return on investment  and to enable them to replenish inventory rapidly 
furthermore  many retailers are consolidating the number of their suppliers to ensure the best service and the volume required for lower cost products 
the company believes that both its sourcing operation in the far east and its mexican manufacturing operations are well positioned to capitalize on these trends 
the continuing predominance of casual wear in the workplace and emphasis on a casual  active lifestyle have increased the demand for casual  moderately priced  private label products 
the company believes its production flexibility of denim and twill products in mexico and its sourcing ability in the far east can satisfy the different requirements from its various customers

the company believes that to a large extent  the cost  problems and inefficiencies initially encountered in its vertical integration strategy have been corrected and the benefits of lower cost production should improve margins 
from the end of through  the us economy experienced an economic downturn  which was exacerbated by the events of september in mexico  the company faced the challenge of an industry wide slowdown coupled with the fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities 
the company responded by implementing programs to cut operating costs  including reducing its workforce by approximately in mexico and hong kong and in the us the company believes the consolidation of its worldwide operations has helped overcome the economic challenges in the past year 
the company also believes that overhead reductions and the current operating efficiency will result in a stronger operating position 
china s entry into the world trade organization wto may pose serious challenges to mexican products due to the elimination of us quotas on chinese apparel products in because the company still maintains a strong sourcing operation in the far east  the company believes it will be able to take advantage of improved pricing from china  and its mexican operation will continue to maintain its competitiveness due to the tariff advantages afforded by nafta

business strategy management believes that the following trends are currently affecting apparel retailing and manufacturing the continued predominance of casual apparel in the workplace and emphasis on a casual  active lifestyle have increased the demand for casual  moderately priced private label products 
consolidation among apparel retailers has increased their ability to demand value added services from apparel manufacturers  including fashion expertise  rapid response  just in time delivery  electronic data interchange edi and favorable pricing

apparel manufacturers offering these capabilities are in demand 
the company believes that it has the capabilities to take advantage of these trends and to become a principal value added supplier of casual  moderately priced  private label apparel because of the following key elements design expertise

on time delivery 
the company has developed a diversified network of international contract manufacturers and fabric suppliers which  together with its vertically integrated mexican manufacturing operations enables the company to accept orders of varying sizes and delivery schedules and to produce a broad range of garments at varying prices depending upon lead time and other requirements of the customer

products while women s jeans have historically been  and continue to be  the company s principal product  in recent years the company has expanded its sales of moderately priced  women s apparel to include casual  denim and non denim  including twill  woven tops and bottoms and has commenced the sale of men s and children s apparel in the company s women s apparel products currently include jeans wear  casual pants  t shirts  shorts  blouses  shirts and other tops  dresses and jackets 
these products are manufactured in petite  standard and large sizes and are sold at a variety of wholesale prices generally ranging from less than to over per garment 
over the past three years  approximately of net sales were derived from the sale of pants and jeans  approximately from the sale of shorts and approximately from the sale of shirts 
the balance of net sales consisted of sales of skirts  dresses  jackets and other products 
while denim continues to be in strong demand  the company s modern spinning and weaving equipment in mexico has the flexibility to produce both denim and twill 
the company  in the ordinary course of its business  regularly evaluates new markets and potential acquisitions and believes that numerous opportunities exist due  in part  to the adverse effect on the earnings of many apparel companies of the recent decline in retail sales  and consolidation among retailers 
such opportunities could include transactions involving acquisitions or brand affiliations 
see acquisitions general and acquisitions vertical integration 
customers for the year ended december   affiliated stores owned by the limited  including express  lerner new york and limited stores accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
lane bryant  currently owned by charming shoppes in but by the limited in  accounted for of net sales in net sales in to affiliated stores owned by the limited inc  including lane bryant  accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
in addition  in sales to walmart  mervyn s and tommy hilfiger accounted for approximately  and of net sales respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales 
in the same period  virtually all of the company s sales were of private label apparel and several major international brands 
the company currently serves over customers  which also include k mart  kohl s  mervyns  sears  abercrombie fitch  northern reflection  tropical sports wear and jc penney 
additionally  the company manufactures branded merchandise for several major designers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
the company generally targets only high volume retailers that it believes could grow into major accounts 
by limiting its customer base to a select group of larger accounts  the company seeks to build stronger long term relationships and leverage its operating costs against large bulk orders 
although the company continues to diversify its customer base  the majority of any growth in sales is expected to come from existing customers 
on october   limited direct associates lp  an entity owned by the limited inc lda  acquired one million shares of the company s common stock through the exercise of an option granted by mr 
guez and mr 
kay  the chairman and president  respectively  of the company  to lda at the time of the company s initial public offering 
the option granted lda the right to purchase of the total shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the initial public offering  or  shares  at a price of per share as adjusted for a two for one stock split effective may  
the transaction was done on a cashless basis  whereby mr 
guez and mr 
kay transferred ownership of one million shares to lda and  in lieu of receiving cash  mr 
guez and mr 
kay retained ownership of the remaining  shares 
the one million shares were subject to a lockup provision  which expired october  the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers and  therefore  there can be no assurance that any customer will continue to place orders with the company of the same magnitude as it has in the past  or at all 
in addition  the apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  with consumer spending for purchases of apparel and related goods tending to decline during recessionary periods 
to the extent that these financial difficulties occur  there can be no assurance that the company s financial condition and results of operations would not be adversely affected

design  merchandising and sales while many private label producers only arrange for the bulk production of styles specified by their customers  the company not only designs garments  but also assists some of its customers in market testing new designs 
the company believes that its design  sample production and test run capabilities give it a competitive advantage in obtaining bulk orders from its customers 
the company also often receives bulk orders for garments it has not designed because many of its customers allocate bulk orders among more than one producer 
the company has developed integrated teams of design  merchandising and support personnel  some of whom serve on more than one team  that focus on designing and producing merchandise that reflects the style and image of their customers 
teams generally are divided between import and domestic sourcing operations 
each team is responsible for all aspects of its customer s needs  including designing products  developing product samples and test items  obtaining orders  coordinating fabric choices and procurement  monitoring production and delivering finished products 
in particular  the team seeks to identify prevailing fashion trends that meet its customer s retail strategies and design garments incorporating those trends 
the team also works with the buyers of its customer to revise designs as necessary to better reflect the style and image that the customer wishes to project to consumers 
during the production process  the team is responsible for informing the customer about the progress of the order  including any difficulties that might affect the timetable for delivery 
in this way  the company and its customer can make appropriate arrangements regarding any delay or other change in the order 
the company believes that this team approach enables its employees to develop an understanding of the customer s distinctive styles and production requirements in order to respond effectively to the customer s needs 
during  the company opened an office in bentonville  arkansas to support this approach and better service the needs of walmart 
the company also operates a similar office in columbus  ohio for the limited  which opened in as part of the company s merchandising strategy  the company produces  at its own expense  five collections a year from hong kong and mexico embodying new designs and fabrics 
the company produces samples at its facilities in guangdong province  china  hong kong and mexico 
the facilities in china and mexico currently furnish the majority of the company s sample requirements 
from time to time and at scheduled seasonal meetings  the company presents its samples to the customer s buyers who determine which  if any  of those samples will be produced on a test run or a bulk scale 
samples are often presented in coordinated groupings or as part of a product line 
some customers  particularly specialty retail stores such as divisions of the limited  may require that a product be tested before placing a bulk order 
testing involves the production of as few as several hundred copies of a given sample in different size  fabric and color combinations 
the customer pays for these test items  which are placed in selected stores to gauge consumer response 
the production of test items enables the company s customers to identify garments that may appeal to consumers and also provides the company with important information regarding the cost and feasibility of the bulk production of the tested garment 
if the test is determined to be successful  the company generally receives a significant percentage of the customer s total bulk order of the tested item 
in addition  as is typical in the private label business  the company receives bulk production orders to produce merchandise designed by its competitors or other designers  since most customers allocate bulk orders among a number of suppliers 
sourcing general when bidding for or filling an order  the company s international sourcing network enables it to choose from among a number of suppliers and manufacturers based on the customer s price requirements  product specifications and delivery schedules 
historically  the company manufactured its products through independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors located primarily in hong kong and china and has purchased its fabric from independent fabric manufacturers with weaving mills located primarily in hong kong and china 
in recent years  the company expanded its network to include suppliers and manufacturers located in a number of additional countries  including thailand  egypt and mexico 
most recently  mexico  through the company s vertical integration strategy  has become the source for more than of its merchandise 
key elements of the company s sourcing strategy include i continuing to maintain its strong sourcing ability in the far east and ii continuing to expand its production of basic denim and twill products in mexico 
the following table sets forth the percent of the company s merchandise  on the basis of the free on board cost at the supplier s plant fob basis  by country for the periods indicated international sourcing hong kong and china other domestic sourcing united states mexico and central america in  such countries consisted of thailand  egypt  cambodia  mongolia and nepal 
dependence on contract manufacturers the use of contract manufacturers and the resulting lack of direct control over the production of its products could result in the company s failure to receive timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
although the company believes that alternative sources of cutting  sewing and finishing services are readily available  the loss of one or more contract manufacturers could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations until an alternative source is located and has commenced producing the company s products 
during the back to school season of  the company experienced this problem when its production was dropped by one such independent contractor 
to avoid this in the future  the company has reduced its reliance on outside third party contractors through its mexico vertical integration strategy 
the company s garment production core business of grupo famian and ajalpan which the company owns  tlaxcala  which is currently leased  the uav joint venture  and the production agreement with manufactures cheja 
all international sourcing is still manufactured by independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors 
see acquisition vertical integration 
although the company monitors the compliance of its independent contractors with applicable labor laws  the company does not control its contractors or their labor practices 
the violation of federal  state or foreign labor laws by one of the company s contractors can result in the company being subject to fines and the company s goods  which are manufactured in violation of such laws  being seized or their sale in interstate commerce being prohibited 
from time to time  the company has been notified by federal  state or foreign authorities that certain of its contractors are the subject of investigations or have been found to have violated applicable labor laws 
to date  the company has not been subject to any sanctions that  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect upon the company  and the company is not aware of any facts on which any such sanctions could be based 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future the company will not be subject to sanctions as a result of violations of applicable labor laws by its contractors  or that such sanctions will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s customers require strict compliance by their apparel manufacturers  including the company  with applicable labor laws 
to that end  the company is regularly inspected by some of its major customers 
there can be no assurance that the violation of applicable labor laws by one of the company s contractors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s relationship with its customers 
except for the company s production agreement with the operator of the twill mill near puebla  mexico  the company does not have any long term contracts with independent fabric suppliers 
the loss of any of its major fabric suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations until alternative arrangements are secured 
the impact of such a loss may be offset in part by the acquisition or development of fabric mills and production facilities in mexico 
see acquisitions vertical integration 
diversified production network the company believes that it has the ability  through its production network  to operate on production schedules with lead times as short as days 
typically  the company s specialty retail customers attempt to respond quickly to changing fashion trends and are increasingly less willing to assume the risk that goods ordered on long lead times will be out of fashion when delivered 
these retailers  including divisions of the limited  frequently require production schedules with lead times ranging from to days 
although mass merchandisers  such as walmart  are beginning to operate on shorter lead times  they are occasionally able to estimate their needs as much as six months to one year in advance for program business basic products that do not change in style significantly from season to season 
the company s ability to operate on production schedules with a wide range of lead times helps it to meet its customers varying needs 
by allocating an order among different manufacturers  the company seeks to fill the high volume orders of its customers  while meeting their delivery requirements 
upon receiving an order  the company determines which of its suppliers and manufacturers both owned and third party contractors can best fill the order and meet the customer s price  quality and delivery requirements 
the company considers  among other things  the price charged by each manufacturer and the manufacturer s available production capacity to complete the order  as well as the availability of quota for the product from various countries and the manufacturer s ability to produce goods on a timely basis subject to the customer s quality specifications 
the company s personnel also consider the transportation lead times required to deliver an order from a given manufacturer to the customer 
in addition  some customers prefer not to carry excess inventory and therefore require that the company stagger the delivery of products over several weeks 
international sourcing the company conducts and monitors its international sourcing operations from its international offices 
at december   the company had offices in hong kong  thailand and mexico 
the staffs at these locations have extensive knowledge about and experience with sourcing and production in their respective regions  including purchasing  manufacturing and quality control 
several times each year  members of the company s senior management  including local staff  visit and inspect the facilities and operations of the company s international suppliers and manufacturers 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risk factors  including  among other things  transportation delays and interruptions  political instability  expropriation  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas  natural disasters and cultural issues 
in addition to these risk factors  the company faces additional risks arising from the uncertainty regarding the future status of hong kong since resumption of chinese sovereignty on july   the continuation of favorable trade relations between the us and china in particular the continuation of china s normal trade relations ntr status for tariff purposes  and the continuation of economic reform programs in china which encourage private economic activity 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
while the company is in the process of establishing business relationships with manufacturers and suppliers located in countries other than hong kong or china  the company still primarily contracts with manufacturers and suppliers located primarily in hong kong and china for its international sourcing needs not including mexico  and currently expects that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
any significant disruption in the company s operations or its relationships with its manufacturers and suppliers located in hong kong or china could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company commenced manufacturing basic denim and twill products through independent contractors in mexico in the second quarter of  and is continuing to expand its use of manufacturing facilities in this region 
during and  the company expanded its mexico production capabilities  and acquired several mexico manufacturing operations 
the company believes that after absorbing the high startup costs  risks and overhead associated with the process  the further diversification of its international sourcing network by increasing the use of manufacturing facilities in mexico along with its vertical integration strategy has i reduced its cost of goods  ii enhanced the proximity of the company s sourcing operations to the company s customers and the company s executive offices  thereby improving delivery times and increasing management s control  and iii lessened certain risks of doing business in the far east 
see acquisitions vertical integration 
the import sourcing process as is customary in industry  the company does not have any long term contracts with its manufacturers 
during the manufacturing process  the company s quality control personnel visit each factory to inspect garments when the fabric is cut  as it is being sewn and as the garment is being finished 
daily information on the status of each order is transmitted from the various manufacturing facilities to the company s offices in hong kong  mexico and los angeles 
the company  in turn  keeps its customers apprised  often through daily telephone calls and frequent written reports 
these calls and reports include candid assessments of the progress of a customer s order  including a discussion of the difficulties  if any  that have been encountered and the company s plans to rectify them 
the company often arranges  on behalf of manufacturers  for the purchase of fabric from a single supplier 
the company has the fabric shipped directly to the cutting factory and invoices the factory for the fabric 
generally  the factories pay the company for the fabric with offsets against the price of the finished goods 
for its longstanding program business  the company may purchase or produce fabric in advance of receiving the order  but in accordance with the customer s specifications 
by procuring fabric for an entire order from one source  the company believes that production costs per garment are reduced and customer specifications as to fabric quality and color can be better controlled 
the manufacturing process the company  through its mexican subsidiaries  has become a vertically integrated apparel manufacturer 
its vertical integration has reduced product costs  allowing the company to better control production variances and making the company more competitive in today s business environment 
in mexico  the company owns the assets including a denim plant along with cutting  sewing  washing  finishing and warehousing facilities and equipment 
as in the case of the products sourced from independent contractors  the manufacturing process begins with the merchandising department in the us working closely with the customers and developing the product 
once the customer places an order for product  the manufacturing process begins 
the mexico and us operations share  via frame relay  the same computer system and communications 
when an order is entered into the computer system  either electronically or manually  the mexico operation schedules production for the appropriate facility 
based on the production schedule  fabric is acquired from either the company s denim plant  the twill plant  which is owned by a related party  or an outside third party 
the fabric is then cut using computerized as well as manual methods 
the cutwork is then transferred to the sewing facility where it is sewn into garments 
once sewn  the company s state of the art washing facilities can perform the complex fashion washing techniques prevalent in today s denim market 
the finishing facility trims and packs the garments for delivery to customers and  finally  the finished garments are shipped to the customer by truck 
distribution based on the company s world wide sourcing capability and in order to properly fulfill orders  the company has tailored its distribution system to meet the needs of the customer 
some customers  like walmart and kohl s  use electronic data interchange edi to send orders and receive merchandise and invoices

the amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors  including the scheduling of manufacturing and shipping of the product  which in some instances  depends on the customer s requirements

the company s experience has been that the cancellations  rejections or returns of orders have not materially reduced the amount of sales realized from its backlog 
import restrictions quotas the company imported approximately of its products on an fob basis in  including approximately imported from mexico 
in the case of mexico  imports are subject to special rules under the north american free trade agreement nafta 
while certain apparel imports may enter free of duty and of quota restrictions  other apparel form mexico remains subject to import duties and quantitative restrictions  but not to the same extent that imports are restricted from countries subject to bilateral textile agreements 
most of the remaining products imported by the company were manufactured in a foreign jurisdictions eg  hong kong and china with which the us has entered into bilateral textile agreements that  among other restrictions  imposes specific quantitative restraints  or quotas  on the amounts of various categories of textiles and apparel that can be imported into the us from that foreign jurisdiction during a particular quota year 
these bilateral textile agreements also include provisions that allow the us to impose quotas on categories of textiles and apparel not previously under quota or to charge ie  impose deductions upon the quotas for origin related violations 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to the restrictions imposed by these bilateral agreements 
through the early s  the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles  known as the multifiber arrangement mfa  provided the international framework for the global regulation of the textile and apparel trade 
pursuant to the mfa  the us entered into these bilateral textile agreements for the purpose of imposing quota on the imports of textiles and apparel

under the atc  quota implemented under the mfa on the importation of textiles and apparel from countries that are members of the world trade organization the wto  which is the successor organization to gatt under the uruguay round agreement will be phased out over a ten year period that commenced on january  with the us phasing out quota on most of the sensitive categories at the end of this period 
however  a member country may  under the uruguay round agreement on safeguards  re impose quotas on textiles and apparel under certain specified conditions 
china is a signatory to the mfa  but was not a member of gatt and  therefore  was not a party to the uruguay round agreement 
china acceded to the wto on december  and as of  quota on chinese origin apparel will be phased out  along with quota on apparel from other wto countries 
because china is now a member of the wto  its exports of textiles and apparel to the us will be covered by the atc

in and  the company experienced a net loss of million and million  respectively 
from inception  the company relied primarily on independent contract manufacturers located primarily in the far east 
commencing in the third quarter of and taking advantage of the north american free trade agreement nafta  the company substantially expanded its use of independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors in mexico  primarily for basic garments 
since  the company has engaged in an ambitious program to develop a vertically integrated manufacturing operation in mexico 
the gross sale of products sourced in mexico was approximately million in or of net sales compared to approximately million in or of net sales 
in addition  the company has maintained its sourcing operation from the far east 
the vertical integration of its manufacturing operations through the development and acquisition of fabric and production capacity in mexico concluded in in addition  the company focused on coordinating and improving the efficiencies of its operations throughout the year 
the company believes that the dual strategy of maintaining independent contract manufacturers in the far east and a company controlled manufacturing network in mexico can best serve the different needs of its customers and enable it to take the best advantage of both markets 
in addition  the company believes it has diversified its business risks associated with doing business abroad including transportation delays  economic or political instability  currency fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of tariffs  export duties  quota  and other trade restrictions 
on march   the company completed the acquisition of a sewing facility located in ajalpan mexico from confecciones jamil  sa de sa which is majority owned by kamel nacif  principal shareholder of the company

on october   the company extended its option to purchase the facility until september  the company has also entered into a production agreement with the operator of the twill mill granting the company the first right to purchase all production capacity of the twill mill 
the company is reviewing strategies and available financing related to exercising the option to purchase this facility prior to the expiration of the option in september the company believes there is a major competitive advantage in being a fully integrated supplier with the capability of controlling and managing the process of manufacturing from raw materials to finished garments 
in order to execute the garment production operations  facilities have been acquired and developed to support anticipated capacity requirements 
computer systems have been developed and installed  which allow the company to better track its production and inventory 
new operational policies have been implemented to insure operations function efficiently and effectively 
the company believes that to a large extent  the cost  problems and inefficiencies initially encountered in its vertical integration strategy have been corrected and the benefits of lower cost production should improve margins 
from the end of through  the us economy experienced an economic downturn  which was exacerbated by the events of september in mexico  the company faced the challenge of an industry wide slowdown coupled with the fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities 
the company responded by implementing programs to cut operating costs  including reducing its workforce by approximately in mexico and hong kong and in the us the company believes the consolidation of its worldwide operations has helped overcome the economic challenges in the past year 
the company also believes that overhead reductions and the current operating efficiency will result in a stronger operating position 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statement  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
vertical integration 
in  the company commenced the vertical integration of its business 
key elements of this strategy include i establishing cutting  sewing  washing  finishing  packing  shipping and distribution activities in company owned facilities or through the acquisition of established contractors and ii establishing fabric production capability through the acquisition of established textile mills or the construction of new mills 
prior to april  the company had no previous history of operating textile mills or cutting  sewing  washing  finishing  packing or shipping operations upon which an evaluation of the prospects of the company s vertical integration strategy can be based 
in addition  such operations are subject to the customary risks associated with owning a manufacturing business  including  but not limited to  the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities  equipment  employees and inventories 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with doing business in foreign countries including  but not limited to  transportation delays and interruptions  political instability  expropriation  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas and cultural issues 
see item acquisitions vertical integration 
reliance on key customers 
affiliated stores owned by the limited including lerner new york  limited stores and express accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales in and  respectively 
lane bryant  owned by charming shoppes in and the limited in  accounted for of net sales in the loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
from time to time  certain of the company s major customers have experienced financial difficulties 
the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that any customer will continue to place orders with the company to the same extent it has in the past  or at all 
in addition  the company s results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon the commercial success of its major customers 
foreign risks 
approximately of the company products were imported in and most of the company s fixed assets are in mexico  the company is subject to the risks associated with doing business and owning fixed assets in foreign countries  including  but not limited to  transportation delays and interruptions  political instability  expropriation  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas and cultural issues 
any changes in those countries labor laws and government regulations may have a negative effect on the company s profitability 
management of complexity 
since the beginning of its vertical integration strategy  the company has experienced increased complexities 
no assurance can be given that the company will meet the demands on management  management information systems  inventory management  production controls  distribution systems  and financial controls given these complexities 
any disruption in the company s order process  production or distribution may have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
manufacturer s risks 
the company  as a manufacturer in mexico  is subject to the customary risks associated with owning a manufacturing business  including but not limited to  the maintenance and management of manufacturing facilities  equipment  employees  trade unions and inventories 
the risk of being a fully integrated manufacturer is amplified in an industrial wide slowdown because of the fixed costs associated with manufacturing facilities variability of quarterly results 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  a substantial variation in its net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include the timing of the company s introduction of new product lines  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product line  general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing  the availability of manufacturing capacity  the seasonality of the markets in which the company participates  the timing of trade shows  the product mix of customer orders  the timing of the placement or cancellation of customer orders  the weather  transportation delays  quotas  the occurrence of charge backs in excess of reserves and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and actions of competitors 
accordingly  a comparison of the company s results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
economic conditions 
the apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits have in the past had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company results of operations 
this has been underscored by the events of september  in addition  certain retailers  including some of the companys customers  have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  financial difficulties  which increase the risk of extending credit to such retailers and the risk that financial failure will eliminate a customer entirely 
these retailers have attempted to improve their own operating efficiencies by concentrating their purchasing power among a narrowing group of vendors 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain a preferred vendor for its existing customers 
a decrease in business from or loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s factor will approve the extension of credit to certain retail customers in the future 
if a customer s credit is not approved by the factor  the company could either assume the collection risk on sales to the customer itself  require that the customer provide a letter of credit or choose not to make sales to the customer 
key personnel 
the company depends on the continued services of its senior management 
the loss of the services of any key employee could hurt the business 
also  the future success of the company depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may impair future results 
china s entry into the wto 
as of  quota on chinese origin apparel will be phased out 
this may pose serious challenges to mexican apparel products sold to the us market 
products from china now receive the same preferential tariff treatment accorded goods from countries granted ntr status 
with china becoming a member of the wto in december  this status is now permanent 
see item import restrictions 
the company s mexican products may be adversely affected by the increased competition from chinese products 
dependence on contract manufacturers 
the company has reduced its reliance on outside third party contractors through its mexico vertical integration strategy 
however  all international and a portion of its domestic sourcing is manufactured by independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors 
the use of contract manufacturers and the resulting lack of direct control over the production of its products could result in the company s failure to receive timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
although the company believes that alternative sources of cutting  sewing and finishing services are readily available  the loss of one or more contract manufacturers could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations until an alternative source is located and has commenced producing the company s products 
although the company monitors the compliance of its independent contractors with applicable labor laws  the company does not control its contractors or their labor practices 
the violation of federal  state or foreign labor laws by one of the company s contractors can result in the company being subject to fines and the company s goods  that are manufactured in violation of such laws being seized or their sale in interstate commerce being prohibited 
from time to time  the company has been notified by federal  state or foreign authorities that certain of its contractors are the subject of investigations or have been found to have violated applicable labor laws 
to date  the company has not been subject to any sanctions that  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect upon the company  and the company is not aware of any facts on which any such sanctions could be based 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future the company will not be subject to sanctions as a result of violations of applicable labor laws by its contractors  or that such sanctions will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  certain of the company s customers  including the limited  require strict compliance by their apparel manufacturers  including the company  with applicable labor laws and visit the company s facilities often 
there can be no assurance that the violation of applicable labor laws by one of the company s contractors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s relationship with its customers 
price and availability of raw materials 
cotton fabric is the principal raw material used in the company s apparel 
although the company believes that its suppliers will continue to be able to procure a sufficient supply of cotton fabric for its production needs  the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate significantly depending on supply  world demand and currency fluctuations  each of which may affect the price and availability of cotton fabric 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the price and availability of cotton fabric or other raw materials used by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management of growth 
since its inception  the company has experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in maintaining or increasing its sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on the company s management  management information systems  inventory management  production capability  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any disruption in the company s order processing  sourcing or distribution systems could cause orders to be shipped late  and under industry practices  retailers generally can cancel orders or refuse to accept goods due to late shipment 
such cancellations and returns would result in a reduction in revenue  increased administrative and shipping costs and a further burden on the company s distribution facilities 
overhead reductions 
since the beginning of  the company has been reducing overhead by the elimination of functions duplicated in los angeles  new york and mexico 
in  the company became more aggressive as sales declined  reducing headcount by in the us and approximately in both mexico and hong kong 
the company may be adversely affected by the increased workloads 
computer and communication systems 
being a multi national corporation  the company relies on its computer and communication network to operate efficiently 
any interruption of this service from power loss  telecommunications failure  weather  natural disasters or any similar event could have a material adverse affect on the company s operations 
recently  hackers and computer viruses have disrupted the operations of several major companies 
the company may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage 
future acquisitions 
in the future  the company may continue its growth through acquisition 
the company may not be successful in overcoming the risks associated with acquiring new businesses and this may have a negative effect on future results 
future capital requirements 
the company may not be able to fund its future growth or react to competitive pressures if it lacks sufficient funds 
currently  the company feels it has sufficient cash available through its bank credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  proceeds from loans from affiliates  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future if necessary 
stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the factors such as quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by the company or its competitors of a material nature  loss of one or more customers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock market price and volume fluctuations 
also  general political and economic conditions such as a recession  or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
closely controlled stock 
at march   certain senior executives beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
these senior executives effectively have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring shareholder approval  including  but not limited to  the election and removal of directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets  and to control the company s management and affairs

comparison of to net sales decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in net sales included a decrease in sales of million to mass merchandisers  a decrease of million to divisions of the limited excluding lane bryant which was sold to charming shoppes in and a decrease of million as a result of converting jane doe from a sales company to a licensing company 
the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the overall economic conditions which are affecting the retail industry 
the weakening economy and announced layoffs have affected consumer spending habits thus hurting retail sales and causing retailers to reduce their orders from suppliers  including the company 
during  sales to divisions of the limited accounted for of total sales as compared to in these results do not include sales to lane bryant  which was sold by the limited in august gross profit which consists of net sales less product costs  duties and direct costs attributable to production for was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for  a decrease of 
the decrease of million in gross profit occurred primarily because of the decline in sales during as compared to the gross profit percent was consistent in both years although lower than anticipated due to excess manufacturing during the year and lower sales levels

during  as the company transitioned some of its operations to mexico thereby reducing overall overhead 
operating income was million in  or of net sales  compared to million in  or of net sales  due to the factors described above

in march  the company converted jdi from an operating company to a licensing company

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to returns  discounts  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts and chargebacks based on the company s historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates ie  an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts reserves was million  compared to million at december  inventory the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
valuation of long lived and iintangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management 
no impairment indicators existed as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
the company had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company will be required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company expects to complete the initial review during the first quarter of income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
debt covenants the company s debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum level of net worth as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if the company s results of operations are eroded and the company is not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lender 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in a majority of the debt agreements  approximately of the company s long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
the company believes that results of operations will improve for the year ending december  and thereafter and the likelihood of our defaulting on debt covenants is unlikely absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
the company also believes that its lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  the company s expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by company 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  the company would experience a material adverse impact on the reported financial position and results of operations 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in mexico as well as certain debt denominated in the euro 
as a result  the company bears the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future as a result of this financing 
at times the company uses forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions and fixed asset purchase obligations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the company actively evaluates the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to derivative financial instruments  and it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations interest rate risk 
because the company s obligations under its various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates primarily libor rates  the company is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect the company s financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on the company s debt 
a majority of the company s credit facilities are at variable rates
