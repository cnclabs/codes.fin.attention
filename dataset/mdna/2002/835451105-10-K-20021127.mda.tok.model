in addition  the company owns and receives income from a minority interest in a few franchised restaurants 
costs of company owned restaurant sales and minority interest in earnings of restaurants relate directly to company owned restaurant sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to both company owned restaurant operations  as well as the company s franchising operations 
the company s revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of company owned restaurants 
the company s revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses are also affected by the number and sales volumes of franchised restaurants 
initial franchise fees and franchise royalties are directly affected by the number of franchised restaurant openings 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenues  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in the company s statements of income 
the table also sets forth certain restaurant data for the periods indicated

number of restaurants open at end of year 
represents percentage increase from the comparable period in the prior year 
represents percentage change for restaurants open in both the reported and prior years 
the calculation of the percentage change of company owned restaurants by core and developing markets is based on a television market determination rather than the state determination reflected in the number of company owned restaurants by core and developing markets set forth above in this table and on page comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year total revenues increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year company owned restaurant sales increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year of the million increase  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year million from the addition of newly constructed restaurants and acquired restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year less million from nine stores sold or closed during the same period 
average sales increases of approximately by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal year and accounted for million of the increase 
franchise royalties increased to million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to franchise same store sales growth of combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate from in fiscal year to in fiscal year each of the company s license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate feature whereby the royalty rate increases as sales volumes increase 
the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in the number of franchise restaurants operating in fiscal year compared to fiscal year franchise fees decreased as franchise drive ins opened during fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year however  the average franchise fee increased as a greater percentage of stores opened under the newest form of license agreement  which has a higher franchise fee and royalty rate 
the company expects total revenue growth during fiscal year of approximately based on targeted same store sales growth of to as well as the addition of approximately to new drive ins to company owned and to franchise 
the company anticipates that the continued benefit of the ascending royalty rate and new franchise store openings will result in million to million in incremental franchise royalties and an increase of approximately seven to ten basis points in the average royalty rate 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was during fiscal year compared to in fiscal year food and packaging costs  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  remained flat as lower than expected beef costs and a moderation in dairy costs were offset by slightly increased discounting from standard menu prices 
payroll and employee benefits  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  increased basis points as a result of an increase in average wage rates  increased investment in store level labor as a part of the company s commitment to outstanding customer service  and an increase in training and store level management for the rollout of the breakfast program 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  decreased basis points primarily as a result of the leverage of higher sales volumes and improvements in utility costs 
minority interest in earnings of restaurants decreased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to during fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year as a result of the decline in overall restaurant level margins 
most of the managers and supervisors of company owned restaurants own a minority interest in the restaurants  and a substantial portion of their compensation flows through the minority interest in earnings of restaurants 
looking forward  the company expects restaurant cost of operations to remain flat or increase slightly  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  during fiscal year as the leverage of operating at higher volumes and a favorable food cost environment is anticipated to mostly offset the continued investment in store level labor and rising workers compensation insurance rates 
the company continues to look for ways to strengthen its partnership program so that a larger percentage of managers and supervisors compensation is derived from the partnership program 
however  since the company expects store level margins to remain flat or deteriorate slightly  minority interest in earnings of restaurants is expected to remain flat or decline slightly as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  as a percentage of total revenues  to during fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year as a result of the leverage of operating at higher sales volumes 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to grow by to in fiscal year while continuing to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
a significant portion of the company s future revenue growth will be attributable to company owned restaurants 
company owned restaurants require a lower level of selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than the company s franchising operations since most expenses of company owned restaurant operations are reflected in restaurant cost of operations and minority interest in restaurant operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million during fiscal year compared to in fiscal year while declining as a percentage of revenue to as compared to the prior year

franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to additional franchise restaurants in operation and an increase in royalty rates caused by the conversion of some of the company s older license agreements to newer agreements  and the automatic royalty rate step up feature contained in many of the company s older license agreements 
the balance of the increase resulted from franchise same store sales growth of in fiscal year each of the company s license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate feature whereby the royalty rate increases as sales volumes increase 
as a result of this feature and the majority of new stores opening under the most current form of license agreement  which contains higher rates  as well as the conversion and automatic step up features described above  the company s average royalty rate grew to during fiscal from during fiscal one hundred fifty seven franchise drive ins opened in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  resulting in an increase in franchise fee revenues 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year food and packaging costs decreased basis points  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  primarily as a result of a lower rate of discounting from standard menu pricing  which combined with lower unit costs for potatoes and pork to more than offset higher beef  dairy and packaging costs 
payroll and employee benefits  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  increased basis points from fiscal year as a result of several factors including an increase in the average wage rate  additional labor related to the company s effort to expand its business in under penetrated day parts  including an expanded breakfast program  as well as incremental training hours associated with an ongoing quality assurance initiative

impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations  management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality the company does not expect seasonality to affect its operations in a materially adverse manner 
the company s results during its second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of company owned and franchised restaurants 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material affect on the company s financial statements 
the company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of risk  judgment and or complexity 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews each restaurant for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
the company tests for impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets related to its brand and its restaurants 
these impairment tests require the company to estimate fair values of its brand and its restaurants by making assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
ownership program allowance for uncollectible notes and accounts receivable 
the company s restaurant philosophy stresses an ownership relationship with supervisors and drive in managers 
most supervisors and managers of company owned restaurants own an equity interest in the restaurant  which is financed by the company 
these notes are typically financed for a term of five years  bear interest at market rates  and are secured by the partner s equity interest 
the company evaluates whether the partner notes are collectible and makes estimates of bad debts based on the restaurant s financial performance and collection history with individual partners 
if an individual restaurant s performance declines  the probability of default by the partners is increased 
the investments made by managers and supervisors in each partnership or limited liability company are accounted for as minority interests in the financial statements 
the ownership agreements contain provisions for buying out partners upon termination 
the amount of the investment made by a partner and the amount of the buy out are based on a number of factors  primarily upon the drive in s financial performance for the preceding months 
in no case  does the buy out amount exceed fair market value 
such payments are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the company collects royalties from franchisees and provides for estimated losses for receivables that are not likely to be collected 
general allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based on historical trends 
although the company has a good relationship with its franchisees and collection rates are currently high  if average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate  the company may have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
contingency reserves 
from time to time  the company is involved in various legal proceedings and has certain unresolved claims pending involving taxing authorities  franchisees  suppliers  employees and competitors 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as estimate potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each issue 
in addition  the company s estimate of probable losses may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company believes that all claims currently pending are either adequately covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
advertising 
under the company s license agreements  each drive in  either company owned or franchise  must contribute a minimum percentage of revenues to a national media production fund sonic advertising fund and spend an additional minimum percentage of gross revenues on local advertising  either directly or through company required participation in advertising cooperatives 
a portion of the local advertising contributions is redistributed to a system marketing fund  which purchases advertising on national cable and broadcast networks and other national media and sponsorship opportunities 
see further description under item  marketing 
as stated in the terms of existing license agreements  these funds do not constitute assets of the company and the company acts with limited agency in the administration of these funds 
accordingly  neither the revenues and expenses nor the assets and liabilities of the advertising cooperatives  the sonic advertising fund  or the system marketing fund are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  all advertising contributions by company owned restaurants are recorded as an expense in the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties 
initial franchise fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income when all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been substantially performed or satisfied by the company 
area development fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise drive in or upon termination of the agreement between the company and the franchisee 
the company s franchisees are required under the provisions of the license agreements to pay the company royalties each month based on a percentage of actual net royalty sales 
however  the royalty payments and supporting financial statements are not due until the th of the following month 
as a result  the company accrues royalty revenue in the month earned based on estimates of franchise store sales 
these estimates are based on actual sales at company owned stores and projections of average unit volume growth at franchise stores 
income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes based on its estimate of federal and state tax liability 
in making this estimate  the company considers the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  the company will update its estimate which could result in an adjustment to the tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and notes receivable  as well as changes in commodity prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of its senior notes  outstanding line of credit  and notes receivable 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  the company has made certain loans to its store operating partners and franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between and 
the company believes the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the impact on the company s results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the line of credit as of the end of fiscal year would be approximately million 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  the company has not made any long term commitments to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase agreements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
