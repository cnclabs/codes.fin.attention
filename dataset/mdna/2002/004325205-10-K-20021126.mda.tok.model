overview acclaim entertainment  inc was founded in as a delaware corporation  and maintains operations in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  spain  australia and japan 
we develop  publish  market and distribute  under our brand names  interactive entertainment software for a variety of hardware platforms  including sony s playstation  microsoft s xbox  and nintendo s gamecube and game boy advance and  to a lesser extent  personal computer systems 
we develop software internally  as well as engaging third parties to develop software on our behalf 
we internally develop our software products through our six software development studios located in the united states and the united kingdom 
additionally  we contract with independent software developers to create software products for us 
through our subsidiaries in north america  the united kingdom  germany  france  spain  and australia  we distribute our software products directly to retailers and other outlets  and we also utilize regional distributors in japan and the pacific rim to distribute software within those geographic areas 
as an additional aspect of our business  we distribute software products which have been developed by third parties 
a less significant aspect of our business is the development and publication of strategy guides relating to our software products and the issuance of certain special edition comic magazines to support some of our time valued brands 
since the company s inception  we have developed products for each generation of major gaming platforms  including ibm r windows based personal computers and compatibles  bit sega genesis video game system  bit super nintendo entertainment system  bit nintendo game boy  game boy advance and game boy color  bit sony playstation  bit nintendo  sega dreamcast  bit sony playstation  bit microsoft xbox  and bit nintendo gamecube 
we also initially developed software for the bit nintendo entertainment system and the bit sega master system 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from one industry segment  the development  publication  marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software 
for information regarding our foreign and domestic operations  see note segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 

table of contents strategy our objective is to become a worldwide leader in the development  publication and distribution of quality interactive entertainment software products that deliver a highly compelling and satisfying consumer entertainment experience 
our strategy includes the following elements create and maintain diversity in product mix  platforms and markets 
we are committed to maintaining a diversified mix of product offerings because a diversified product mix mitigates our operating risks  contributes to enhanced profitability and broadens our demographic market appeal 
see factors affecting future performance we depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenue and profits 
therefore  we strive to develop and publish products spanning a wide range of product categories  including action  adventure  action sports  arcade style games  extreme sports  racing  role playing  simulation and strategy  and products designed for target audiences ranging from game enthusiasts and children to mass market consumers and value priced buyers 
presently  we concentrate on developing  publishing and distributing products that operate on sony s playstation  microsoft s xbox  and nintendo s gamecube console systems and nintendo s game boy advance  hand held device and personal computers 
we may offer our products for use on multiple platforms in order to leverage our costs of development over a larger installed hardware base  therefore increasing potential unit sales 
accordingly  there are a number of factors that we take into consideration in determining the appropriate platform for each product developed including  amongst other things  the platform user demographics  the potential growth of the installed base of each platform and the competitive landscape at the time of a product s release 
create  acquire and maintain strong brands 
we attempt to focus our game developing and publishing activities principally on products that are  or have the potential to become  franchise properties possessing sustainable consumer appeal and brand recognition 
such products can serve as the basis for sequels  prequels and related new products  which can be released over an extended period of time  similar to the movie entertainment industry 
the publication and distribution of products based in large part on franchise properties has the potential to enhance the predictability of net revenue 
we have entered into a number of strategic relationships with the owners of various forms of intellectual property  which have allowed us to acquire the rights to publish products based upon such franchises 
see factors affecting future performance our future depends on our ability to release popular products 
disciplined product selection and development processes 
the success of our publishing business depends  in significant part  on our ability to develop games that will generate high unit volume sales while simultaneously meeting our quality standards 
our quality publishing units use a formal control process for the selection  development  production and quality assurance of our products 
we apply this process to products under development with external  as well as internal  resources 
this process includes in depth reviews of each project at numerous intervals during the development process by a team that includes a number of operating managers from our sales  marketing and product development areas 
in house development group 
we have a substantial in house development staff  both domestically and internationally  who work in project teams to create our software 
we are striving to provide our creative teams the independence and flexibility they need to build an environment that fosters creativity and teamwork 
employing in house development teams provides us with the following advantages they collaborate with each other sharing development techniques  software tools  game engines and useful experience  to form a strong collective and creative environment  they can re focus their efforts quickly to meet the changing needs of key projects  they have more control over product quality  scheduling and costs  and they are not subject to the competing needs of other publishers 

table of contents historically  we have developed our products using a strategic combination of our internal development group and external development resources 
we select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in producing products within certain categories 
as part of that strategy  one external developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game 
this selection process allows us to strengthen and leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources 
software development we have invested  and will continue to invest  in the creation of state of the art software programming tools utilized in our product development process 
utilizing these programming tools provides us with greater flexibility to create game engines for each of the next generation hardware systems 
these tools provide a competitive advantage in the creation of next generation software  since not all entertainment software publishers maintain their own internal development studios 
our investment in software programming tools for the earlier hardware platforms has been strategically important in positioning us for the current generation of bit hardware 
these investments continue to provide value to acclaim 
during fiscal  a majority of our gross revenue  approximately  was derived from software developed at our internal studios by our in house development group 
the balance of our gross revenue for fiscal was derived from software development contracted through third party developers 
in fiscal  we again anticipate that the majority of our revenue will be derived from software developed in our own studios  through the release of our major franchise titles such as alias  all star baseball  legends of wrestling and nba jam 
the development time for a software title on both the dedicated game platforms and personal computers is between twelve and thirty six months and the average development cost for a title ranges from million to million 
the development time for portable systems such as game boy advance is between six and nine months and the average development cost for a title ranges from  to  gross margin percentages for cartridge based game boy advance software are significantly lower than the gross margin percentages for disc based software and the manufacturing time is significantly longer than that associated with disc based software 
the manufacturing lead time for disc based software for the three platform systems is approximately one to three weeks from the placement of an order  as opposed to four to six weeks for cartridge based software 
our product development methodology and organization have in the past been  and continue to be  modeled upon those used in the software industry 
our producers oversee  and are responsible for  the development of our software titles 
these producers manage and monitor the quality  delivery schedule  milestones  and budget for each title  ensure that the title follows the approved product specifications  coordinate testing and final approval of the title  and report directly to the manager responsible for the title 
additionally  we test all software  whether developed by our internal studios or by third party developers  for bugs prior to the title s manufacture 
the software is also tested for bugs by the hardware manufacturers 
the software titles for personal computers are also tested for bugs both internally and by independent testing organizations 
to date  we have not had to recall any of our software due to bugs 

table of contents products we utilize a brand structure and market our products under four distinct key brands acclaim  aka acclaim  acclaim sports  and club acclaim 
we support this strategy through the regularly scheduled introduction of new titles featuring these brands 
in fiscal  we released a total of forty two titles for playstation  xbox  gamecube  game boy advance and personal computers 
in fiscal  we currently plan on releasing a total of approximately fifty five titles for playstation  xbox  gamecube  game boy advance and personal computers 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we have released  to date  four titles for playstation  two titles for xbox  three titles for gamecube and three titles for game boy advance 
see factors affecting future performance our future success depends on our ability to release popular products 
the average life cycle of a new software title is largely dependent on its initial success and will generally range from three months to upwards of twelve to eighteen months  with the majority of sales of the game occurring in the first thirty to one hundred and twenty days after the games release 
therefore  we are constantly required to introduce new titles in order to generate revenue and or replace declining revenue from older titles 
our software titles come from a variety of sources  including our own intellectual property assets  such as  shadowman and vexx scheduled for release in fiscal and a variety of exclusive and non exclusive licenses  including professional sports major league baseball  major league baseball players association and the national basketball association  television and film mary kate and ashley the olsen twins  and alias  sports personalities derek jeter  hulk hogan and george foreman  extreme sports personalities dave mirra  racing paris dakar and burnout  arcade crazy taxi and wheeler american pro trucker  and comic books turok and shadow man 
some of the agreements granting us the rights to use these brands are restricted to individual properties  while some of the agreements cover a series of properties or grant rights to create software based on or featuring particular brands over a period of time 
see factors affecting future performance inability to procure commercially valuable intellectual property licenses may prevent product releases or result in reduced product sales and note license agreements to the notes to the consolidated financial statements at item in this form k

table of contents market we do  and will continue to  develop and publish products for multiple hardware platforms  as this diversification is a key element of our business strategy 
in the past  no hardware platform or video game system has achieved substantial long term dominance in the interactive entertainment market 
new entrants into the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries  such as cable television  telephone companies  and diversified media and entertainment companies  in addition to a proliferation of new technologies  such as online networks and the internet  have increased the competition in our markets 
see factors affecting future performance industry trends  platforms transitions and technological change may adversely affect our revenue and profitability and competition for market acceptance sony released the playstation platform in japan in march  in north america in october and in europe in november the playstation platform is a bit  digital versatile disk dvd based system that is internet and cable ready  as well as backward compatible with the current playstation platform software

to date  we have not received any material claims of infringement 
see discussion below on patent  trademark  copyright and product protection 
marketing and advertising the target consumers for our software titles vary due to the specific content of the title and the title s rating from the entertainment software ratings board 
the primary audience for these titles is generally comprised of males aged twelve to thirty five 
for pc titles our target audience is primarily males aged fifteen to thirty five 
we are also continuing to target one of the industry s fastest growing  yet under served segments the youth girl gamers 
the successful mary kate and ashley brand titles are positioned for the youth girl gamers segment of the female market and attempts to leverage the popularity of these young actresses 
according to current toy retail sales tracking service trsts sales data  our mary kate and ashley brand is currently the top performing female youth oriented brand in the interactive entertainment industry 
in developing a marketing strategy for a title  we seek story concepts and brands or franchises that we believe will appeal to the interests of the title s target consumer 
we strive to create marketing campaigns which are consistent with this strategy and which we believe will appeal to the targeted consumers for each of those titles 
we market our software through television  radio  print  outdoor and internet advertising  our website www 
acclaim 
com and the internet sites of others  product sampling through demonstration software distributed on the internet  consumer contests and promotions  publicity activities  and trade shows 
in addition  we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our customers  where our software is featured in the retail customer s own advertisements to its customers 
dealer displays and in store merchandising are also used to increase consumer awareness of our products 

table of contents online  broadband and wireless technologies we think that there will be opportunities for further exploitation of our intellectual properties through the internet  online services  hand held and other wireless devices and dedicated internet online game services  as the hardware platform technology evolves and becomes more accepted 
we are actively exploring the establishment of online game playing opportunities for the internet and wireless services as a method for realizing additional revenue from our products and an additional platform for our products 
we also plan to develop online components which will support online play for certain of our existing franchises  as well as for new software titles currently being developed for the next generation platforms 
as an example  we intend to release an online version of all star baseball for one or more of the game platforms 
as wireless and online technologies evolve  we think that a number of our intellectual properties may have the potential to be exploited through these mediums 
manufacturing we prepare a set of master program copies  documentation and packaging materials for our products for each respective hardware platform upon which the product is released 
except with respect to products for use on the sony and nintendo systems  our disc duplication  packaging  printing  manufacturing  warehousing  assembly and shipping are performed by third party subcontractors 
in order to maintain protection over their hardware technologies  sony and nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing of the finished products 
we deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator  which then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us and or our warehouse facility for distribution to our customers 
at the time our product unit orders are filled by the manufacturer  we become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units  even if the units do not ultimately sell 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products or material returns due to product defects 
production  sales and distribution pursuant to our agreements with nintendo and sony  each hardware manufacturer manufactures the cds or dvds embodying the software we have developed for its system 
pursuant to our agreement with nintendo  we are required to open a letter of credit simultaneously with the placing of a purchase order for the software 
game boy advance software is delivered to us approximately four weeks after order placement 
disc based software for the three platforms is manufactured and then delivered to our warehouse within seven to twenty one days after we place the order with the manufacturer

we manufacture  through subcontractors  all of our software titles for personal computers 
orders for pc software are generally filled within ten to twenty one days after order placement 
reorders for such software are generally filled within ten days 
we distribute our software by tailoring our distribution methods to each geographic market 
in north america  our software is sold directly by our sales force  complemented by regional sales representative organizations which receive commissions based on the net sales of each product sold 
we maintain an in house sales management team to supervise the regional sales representatives

for sales in other markets  we appoint regional distributors 
we are not contractually obligated to accept returns except for defective products 
however  we grant price concessions to our key customers who are major retailers that control market access to the consumer  when those concessions are necessary to maintain our relationships with the retailers and access to their retail channel customers 
if the consumers demand for a specific title falls below expectations or significantly declines below previous rates of sell through  then  we may negotiate a price concession or credit to spur further sales by retailers to maintain the relationship 
as the market for each generation of game consoles matures and as more titles become available  the risk of product price concessions and returns increases 
we establish sales allowances at the time we record revenue for expected product price concessions and returns based primarily on market acceptance of our products  level of retail inventories  seasonal factors  and historical price concession and return rates 
management continually monitors and adjusts these allowances to take into account actual developments and sales results in the marketplace

competition the interactive entertainment software business is highly competitive 
it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies 
our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours

table of contents factors affecting future performance our future operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the known material risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows our ability to meet cash requirements and maintain necessary liquidity rests in part on the cooperation of our primary lender and vendors  and our ability to achieve our projected revenue levels and reduced operating expenses if we do not substantially achieve our overall projected revenue levels for fiscal  fail to operate within our projected expense levels as reflected in our business operating plans  or do not receive the ongoing support of our primary lender  gmac commercial credit llc and our vendors  then we will be unable to meet our cash and operating requirements for the next twelve months  which would in turn require us to seek additional financing to fund operations and or implement additional expense reductions 
our fiscal business plan includes a lowering fixed and variable expenses worldwide  b eliminating the continued development of certain marginal software products which are not expected to achieve our financial return parameters within the next to months  c limiting and eliminating non essential marketing expenses and d reducing employee related expenses through staff reductions 
some of these measures would require third party consents or approvals  including that of our primary lender  and there can be no assurance that such consents or approvals will be obtained 
we rely on our primary lender to assist us in meeting our cash needs from time to time in the form of advances against receivables and inventory and periodic discretionary supplemental loans 
we also rely on our vendors to provide us with favorable payment terms 
see if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our operational needs  we may be forced to sell assets  refinance debt  or further downsize our operations 
failing to substantially achieve our projected revenue levels for fiscal may also result in a default under our credit agreement with our primary lender 
if a default were to occur under our credit agreement and it is not timely cured by us or waived by our lender  or if this were to happen and our debt could not be refinanced or restructured  our lender could pursue its remedies  including penalty rates of interest  demand for immediate repayment of the debt  and or the foreclosure on any of our assets securing the debt 
if this were to happen and we were liquidated or reorganized  after payment to our creditors  there would likely be insufficient assets remaining for any distribution to our stockholders 
in march and june of  we amended certain provisions of our credit agreement and factoring agreements with our lender  and we are currently negotiating with our lender to further amend and or restate those agreements 
as of august   we received waivers from gmac with respect to those financial covenants contained in the credit agreement for which we were not in compliance 
if waivers from gmac are necessary in the future  we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain waivers of any future covenant violations  as we have in the past 
we currently anticipate that we will need to implement significant expense reductions in fiscal and have begun implementing certain headcount reductions and eliminating the continued development of certain marginal software products  as well as limiting and eliminating non essential marketing expenses during the first quarter of fiscal we cannot assure our stockholders and investors that we will achieve the overall projected sales levels based on our planned product release schedule  achieve profitability or achieve the cash flows necessary to avoid further expense reductions in fiscal see factors affecting future performance if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our operational needs  we may be forced to sell assets  refinance debt  or further downsize our operations  and industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
going concern consideration while the accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that acclaim will continue as a going concern  our independent auditors report  prepared by kpmg llp  includes an explanatory 
table of contents paragraph relating to substantial doubt as to the ability of acclaim to continue as a going concern  due to a working capital deficit as of august  and the recurring use of cash in operating activities 
if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our operational needs  we may be forced to sell assets  refinance debt  or further downsize our operations during the first half of fiscal  we have commenced and will continue to implement certain expense reduction initiatives which we anticipate will reduce our operating expenses commencing with the first quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  so that our operating expenses are in line with our sales forecasts 
our operating plan for fiscal focuses on lowering fixed and variable expenses worldwide  eliminating the continued development of certain marginal software products which are not expected to achieve our financial return parameters within the next to months  limiting and eliminating non essential marketing expenses and reducing employee related expenses through staff reductions 
although we believe the actions we are taking should return our operations to profitability  we cannot assure our stockholders and investors that we will achieve the sales necessary to achieve sufficient liquidity and avoid further expense reduction actions such as selling assets or consolidating operations  reducing staff  refinancing debt and or otherwise restructuring our operations 
see industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect our revenue and profitability below and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
a violation of our financing agreements could result in gmac declaring a default and seeking remedies if we violate the financial or other covenants contained in our credit agreement with gmac  we will be in default under the credit agreement 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement and is not timely cured by us or waived by gmac  gmac could seek remedies against us  including penalty rates of interest  immediate repayment of the debt  and or the foreclosure on any assets securing the debt 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we are required to maintain specified levels of working capital and tangible net worth  among other covenants 
as of august   we received waivers from gmac with respect to those financial covenants contained in the credit agreement for which we were not in compliance 
if waivers from gmac are necessary in the future  we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain waivers of any future covenant violations  as we have in the past 
if acclaim is liquidated or reorganized  after payment to the creditors  there are likely to be insufficient assets remaining for any distribution to our stockholders 
revenue and liquidity are dependent on timely introduction of new titles the timely shipment of a new title depends on various factors  including the development process  debugging  approval by hardware licensors and approval by third party licensors 
it is likely that some of our titles will not be released in accordance with our operating plans 
because net revenue associated with the initial shipments of a new product generally constitute a high percentage of the total net revenue associated with the life of a product  a significant delay in the introduction of one or more new titles would negatively affect or limit sales as was the case in the first and third quarters of fiscal and would have a negative impact on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  as was the case in fiscal and we cannot assure stockholders that our new titles will be released in a timely fashion in accordance with our business plan 
the average life cycle of a new title generally ranges from three months to upwards of twelve to eighteen months  with the majority of sales occurring in the first thirty to one hundred twenty days after release 
factors such as competition for access to retail shelf space  consumer preferences and seasonality could result in the shortening of the life cycle for older titles and increase the importance of our ability to release new titles on a timely basis 
therefore  we are constantly required to introduce new titles in order to generate revenue and or to replace declining revenue from older titles 
in the past  we experienced delays in the introduction of new titles  which have had a negative impact on our results of operations 
the complexity of next generation systems has 
table of contents resulted in higher development expenditures  longer development cycles and the need to carefully monitor and plan the product development process 
if we do not introduce titles in accordance with our operating plans for a period  our results of operations  liquidity and profitability in that period could be negatively affected 
we depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenue and profits a significant portion of our revenue is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises each year 
in addition  many of these products have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets 
in fiscal  of our gross revenue was derived from five franchises 
in fiscal  four franchises accounted for of our gross revenue 
in fiscal  four franchises accounted for of our gross revenue 
we expect that a limited number of popular brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our revenue 
due to this dependence on a limited number of brands  the failure of one or more products based on these brands to achieve anticipated results may significantly harm our business and financial results 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our failure to achieve our projected revenue from two titles  turok evolution and aggressive inline  due to lower than anticipated consumer acceptance of the products  resulted in a net loss for the fourth quarter and fiscal year industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect our revenue and profitability the life cycle of existing game systems and the market acceptance and popularity of new game systems significantly affects the success of our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to predict accurately the life cycle or popularity of each system 
if we do not develop software for games consoles that achieve significant market acceptance  discontinue development of software for a system that has a longer than expected life cycle  develop software for a system that does not achieve significant popularity  or continue development of software for a system that has a shorter than expected life cycle  our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected and we could experience losses from operations 
when new platforms are announced or introduced into the market  consumers typically reduce their purchases of software products for the current platforms  in anticipation of new platforms becoming available 
during these periods  sales of our software products can be expected to slow down or even decline until the new platforms have been introduced and have achieved wide consumer acceptance 
each of the three current principal hardware producers launched a new platform in recent years 
sony made the first shipments of its playstation console system in north america and europe in the fourth quarter of calendar year microsoft made the first shipments of its xbox console system in north america in november and in europe and japan in the first quarter of calendar nintendo made the first shipments of its nintendo gamecube console system in north america in november and in europe in may additionally  in june  nintendo launched its game boy advance hand held device 
on occasion the video and computer games industry is affected  in both favorable and unfavorable ways  by a competitor s entry into  or exit from  the hardware or software sectors of the industry 
for example  in early  sega exited the hardware business  ceased distribution and sales of its dreamcast console and re deployed its resources to develop software for multiple consoles 
more recently  the entry of microsoft which traditionally had only produced software and hardware for personal computers into the video game console market with the xbox has benefited us and other video game publishers by expanding the total size of the market for video games 
the effects of this type of entry or exit can be significant and difficult to anticipate 
we believe the next hardware transition cycle will occur sometime during delays in the launch  shortages  technical problems or lack of consumer acceptance of these platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for these platforms 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to release popular products the life of any one software product is relatively short  in many cases less than one year 
it is therefore important for us to be able to continue to develop new products that are favorably received by consumers 
if we are unable to do this  our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
we focus our development and publishing activities principally on products that are  or have the potential to become  franchise brand properties 
many of these products are based on intellectual property and other character or story rights acquired or licensed from third parties 
these license and distribution agreements are limited in scope and time  and we may not be able to renew key licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing licenses 
the loss of a significant number of our intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with licensors would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and therefore on our business and financial results 
profitability is affected by research and development expenditure fluctuations due to platform transitions and development for multiple platforms our cash outlays for product development for fiscal a portion of which were expensed and the remainder of which were capitalized were higher than the same period last year  and our product development cash outlays may increase in the future as a result of releasing more games across multiple platforms  delayed attainment of technological feasibility and the complexity of developing games for the bit game consoles  among other reasons 
we anticipate that our profitability will continue to be impacted by the levels of research and development expenditures relative to revenue  and by fluctuations relating to the timing of development in anticipation of future platforms 
during fiscal  we focused our development efforts and costs on the development of tools and engines necessary for playstation  xbox and gamecube 
our fiscal release schedule was developed around playstation  gamecube  xbox and game boy advance 
the release schedule for fiscal continues to support these same platforms 
if price concessions and returns exceed allowances  we may incur losses in the past  particularly during platform transitions  we have had to increase our price concessions granted to our retail customers 
coupled with more competitive pricing  if our allowances for price concessions and returns are exceeded  our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted  as has occurred in the past 
we grant price concessions to our key customers major retailers which control market access to the consumer when we deem those concessions are necessary to maintain our relationships with those retailers and continued access to their retail channel customers 
if the consumers demand for a specific title falls below expectations or significantly declines below previous rates of retail sell through  then a price concession or credit may be requested by our customers to spur further sales 
management makes significant estimates and assumptions regarding allowances for estimated price concessions and product returns in preparing the financial statements 
management establishes allowances at the time of product shipment  taking into account the potential for price concessions and product returns based primarily on market acceptance of products in retail and distributor inventories  level of retail inventories and retail sell through rates  seasonality  and historical price concession and product return rates 
management monitors and adjusts these allowances quarterly to take into account actual developments and results in the marketplace 
we believe that our allowances for price concessions and returns are adequate  but we cannot guarantee the adequacy of our current or future allowances 
if we are unable to obtain or renew licenses from hardware developers  we will not be able to release software for popular systems we are substantially dependent on each hardware developer as the sole licensor of the specifications needed to develop software for its game system  as the sole manufacturer nintendo and sony software of 
table of contents the software developed by us for its game systems  to protect the intellectual property rights to their game consoles and technology  and to discourage unauthorized persons from producing software for its game systems 
substantially all of our revenue has historically been derived from sales of software for game systems 
if we cannot obtain licenses to develop software from developers of popular interactive entertainment game platforms or if any of our existing license agreements are terminated  we will not be able to release software for those systems  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability 
although we cannot assure stockholders that when the term of existing license agreements end we will be able to obtain extensions or that we will be successful in negotiating definitive license agreements with developers of new systems  to date we have always been able to obtain extensions or new agreements with the hardware companies 
our revenue growth may also be dependent on constraints the hardware companies impose 
if new license agreements contain product quantity limitations  our revenue  cash flows and profitability may be negatively impacted 
in addition  when we develop software titles for systems offered by sony and nintendo  the products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer 
since each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware system  a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity 
we could be materially harmed by unanticipated delays in the manufacturing and delivery of products 
inability to procure commercially valuable intellectual property licenses may prevent product releases or result in reduced product sales our titles often embody trademarks  trade names  logos  or copyrights licensed by third parties  such as the national basketball association and major league baseball and their respective players associations  or individual athletes or celebrities 
the loss of one or more of these licenses would prevent us from releasing a title and limit our economic success 
we cannot assure stockholders that our licenses will be extended on reasonable terms or at all  or that we will be successful in acquiring or renewing licenses to property rights with significant commercial value 
license agreements relating to these rights generally extend for a term of two to three years and are terminable upon the occurrence of a number of factors  including the material breach of the agreement by either party  failure to pay amounts due to the licensor in a timely manner  or a bankruptcy or insolvency by either party 
we depend on skilled personnel our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify  hire and retain skilled personnel 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical  marketing  sales  product development and management skills 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so 
if we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel  our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 
competition for market acceptance and retail shelf space  pricing competition  and competition with the hardware manufacturers affects our revenue and profitability the interactive entertainment software industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced 
our competitors vary in size from small companies to very large corporations with significantly greater financial  marketing and product development resources than 
table of contents we have 
due to these greater resources  certain of our competitors can undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture  television  sports and character properties and pay more to third party software developers than we can 
only a small percentage of titles introduced in the market achieve any degree of sustained market acceptance 
if our titles are not successful  our operations and profitability will be negatively impacted 
competition in the video and computer games industry is based primarily upon availability of significant financial resources  the quality of titles  reviews received for a title from independent reviewers who publish reviews in magazines  websites  newspapers and other industry publications  publisher s access to retail shelf space  the success of the game console for which the title is written  the price of each title  the number of titles then available for the system for which each title is published  and the marketing campaign supporting a title at launch and through its life 
we compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment software 
significant third party software competitors currently include  among others activision  capcom  eidos  electronic arts  infogrames  interplay entertainment  konami  namco  midway games  sega  take two  thq  do and vivendi universal publishing 
in addition  integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as sony  nintendo and microsoft compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective systems 
the hardware developers have a price  marketing and distribution advantage with respect to software marketed by them 
as each game system cycle matures  significant price competition and reduced profit margins result  as we experienced in fiscal in addition  competition from new technologies may reduce demand in markets in which we have traditionally competed 
as a result of prolonged price competition and reduced demand as a result of competing technologies  our operations and liquidity have in the past been  and in the future may be  negatively impacted 
revenue varies due to the seasonal nature of video and computer game software purchases the video and computer games industry is highly seasonal 
typically  net revenue is highest in our first fiscal quarter  declines in our second fiscal quarter  is lower in the third fiscal quarter and increases again in our fourth fiscal quarter 
the seasonal pattern is due primarily to the increased demand for software during the year end holiday selling season and the reduced demand for software during the summer months 
our earnings vary significantly and are materially affected by releases of popular products and  accordingly  may not necessarily reflect the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole 
we expect that operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
see factors affecting future performance fluctuations in quarterly operating results lead to unpredictability of revenue and income below 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results lead to unpredictability of revenue and earnings the timing of the release of new titles can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations 
a significant portion of revenue in any quarter is often derived from sales of new titles introduced in that quarter or shipped in the immediately preceding quarter 
if we are unable to begin volume shipments of a significant new title during the scheduled quarter  as has been the case in the past including the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 
table of contents  and the first and third quarters of fiscal  our revenue and earnings will be negatively affected in that period 
in addition  because a majority of the unit sales for a title typically occur in the first thirty to one hundred twenty days following its introduction  revenue and earnings may increase significantly in a period in which a major title is introduced and may decline in the following period or in a period in which there are no major title introductions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to domestic retail sales for turok evolution and aggressive inline significantly falling below our projections and anticipated rates of product sell through  our revenue and earnings for that period were substantially below expectations 
quarterly operating results also may be materially impacted by factors  including the level of market acceptance or demand for titles and the level of development and or promotion expenses for a title 
consequently  if net revenue in a period is below expectations  our operating results and financial position in that period are likely to be negatively affected  as has occurred in the past 
our software may be subject to governmental restrictions or rating systems legislation is periodically introduced at the local  state and federal levels in the united states and in foreign countries to establish a system for providing consumers with information about graphic violence and sexually explicit material contained in interactive entertainment software products 
in addition  many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to censor the content and advertising of interactive entertainment software 
we believe that mandatory government run rating systems eventually may be adopted in many countries that are significant markets or potential markets for our products 
we may be required to modify our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new regulations  which could delay the release of our products in those countries 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we released bmx xxx  a software title which is based on bmx bicycle riding  but which contains adult content  partial nudity and adult humor 
accordingly  certain retailers have elected not to carry bmx xxx due to its mature content 
if we create additional games with similar entertainment content in the future  retailers may again elect to not carry those games 
due to the uncertainties regarding such rating systems  confusion in the marketplace may occur  and we are unable to predict what effect  if any  such rating systems would have on our business 
in addition to such regulations  certain retailers have declined to stock some of our products  such as our new software title bmx xxx  because they believed that the content of the packaging artwork or the products would be offensive to the retailer s customer base 
while to date these actions have not caused material harm to our business  we cannot assure you that the actions taken by certain retailers and distributors regarding bmx xxx or  similar actions by our distributors or retailers in the future  would not cause material harm to our business 
our stock price is volatile and stockholders may not be able to recoup their investment there is a history of significant volatility in the market prices of securities of companies engaged in the software industry  including acclaim 
movements in the market price of our common stock from time to time have negatively affected stockholders ability to recoup their investment in the stock 
the price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile  and stockholders may not be able to recoup their investment 
if our future revenue  cash used in or provided by from operations liquidity  profitability or product releases do not meet expectations  the price of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if our securities were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  it may negatively impact the liquidity of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our securities were delisted from quotation on the nasdaq national market 
our common stock is currently trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
although we meet the current 
table of contents listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market  no assurance can be given as to our ongoing ability to meet the nasdaq smallcap market maintenance requirements 
in order to obtain relisting of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  we must satisfy certain quantitative designation criteria 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to meet all of such relisting criteria for the nasdaq national market in the near future 
if our common stock was to be delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market  trading  if any  in our common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the non nasdaq over the counter market 
delisting of the common stock would result in  among other things  limited release of the market price of the common stock and limited company news coverage and could restrict investors interest in the common stock as well as materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for the common stock and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
infringement could lead to costly litigation and or the need to enter into license agreements  which may result in increased operating expenses existing or future infringement claims by or against us may result in costly litigation or require us to license the proprietary rights of third parties  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations  liquidity and profitability 
we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
as the number of titles in the industry increases  we believe that claims and lawsuits with respect to software infringement will also increase 
from time to time  third parties have asserted that some of our titles infringed their proprietary rights 
we have also asserted that third parties have likewise infringed our proprietary rights 
these infringement claims have sometimes resulted in litigation by and against us 
to date  none of these claims has negatively impacted our ability to develop  publish or distribute our software 
we cannot guarantee that future infringement claims will not occur or that they will not negatively impact our ability to develop  publish or distribute our software 
factors specific to international sales may result in reduced revenue and or increased costs international sales have historically represented material portions of our revenue and are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods 
sales in foreign countries may involve expenses incurred to customize titles to comply with local laws 
in addition  titles that are successful in the domestic market may not be successful in foreign markets due to different consumer preferences 
we continue to evaluate our international product development and release schedule to maximize the delivery of products that appeal specifically to that marketplace 
international sales are also subject to fluctuating exchange rates 
the adoption of the euro as the single currency of most european union member nations may reduce our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates within the european union if the price of the euro remains tied to that of the us dollar  however  consumers in the european union may face slight price increases as a result of the transition as retailers round up the price of goods calculated in euros 
these and other factors specific to international sales may result in reduced revenue and or increased costs 
our software may be subject to legal claims within the past three years  two lawsuits  linda sanders  et al 
v 
meow media  inc  et al  united states district court for the district of colorado  and joe james  et al 
v 
meow media  inc  et al  united states district court for the western district of kentucky  paducah division  have been filed against numerous video game companies  including us  by the families of victims who were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools 
these lawsuits allege that the video game companies manufactured and or supplied these teenagers with violent video games  teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to act out in a violent manner 
both lawsuits referenced in this paragraph have been dismissed and are currently undergoing various stages of the appeals process 
while our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend us in these lawsuits  it is uncertain whether or not the insurance carrier would cover all or any amounts which we might be 
table of contents liable for if the lawsuits are not decided in our favor 
if either of the lawsuits are ultimately decided against us and our insurance carrier does not cover the amounts we are liable for  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
it is possible that similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future 
payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such insurance coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future  thereby exposing our business to additional risk 
charter and anti takeover provisions could negatively affect rights of holders of common stock our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine their characteristics without stockholder approval 
in this regard  in june  the board of directors approved a stockholder rights plan 
if the series b junior participating preferred stock is issued it would be more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our voting stock 
in addition to the series b preferred stock  the board of directors may issue additional preferred stock and  if this is done  the rights of common stockholders may be negatively impacted by the rights of those preferred stockholders 
we are also subject to anti takeover provisions of delaware corporate law  which may impede a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the board 
in addition  employment arrangements with some members of management provide for severance payments upon termination of their employment if there is a change in control 
shares eligible for future sale as of november   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding  of which  are restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act 
generally  under rule  a person who has held restricted shares for one year may sell such shares  subject to certain volume limitations and other restrictions  without registration under the securities act 
as of november    shares of common stock are covered by effective registration statements under the securities act for resale on a delayed or continuous basis by certain of our security holders  of which  shares of common stock are issuable upon the exercise of warrants issued in settlement of litigation as of august   a total of  shares of common stock are issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock not including warrants issued in settlement of litigation 
we have also registered on form s a total of  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options under our stock option plan and our stock incentive plan  and a total of  shares of common stock under our restricted stock plan 
as of august   options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock were outstanding under the stock option plan and the stock incentive plan  of which  were exercisable 
in connection with licensing and distribution arrangements  acquisitions of other companies  the repurchase of notes and financing arrangements  we have issued and may continue to issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
any such issuance or future issuance of substantial amounts of common stock or convertible securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital

we use estimates for  but not limited to  accounting for the allowance for price concessions and returns  the valuation of inventory  the recoverability of advance royalty payments and the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
we base estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are relevant under the circumstances  the results from which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition in conjunction with the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue for noncustomized software when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the software is delivered  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
we do not customize our software or provide post contract support to our customers 
the timing of when we recognize revenue generally differs for our retail customers and distributor customers 
for retail customers  we recognize software product revenue when the products are shipped to the retail customers 
because we do not provide extended payment terms and our revenue arrangements with retail customers do not include multiple deliverables such as upgrades  post contract customer support or other elements  our selling price for software products is fixed and determinable when titles are shipped to our retail customers 
we generally deem collectibility probable at the time titles are shipped to retail customers because the majority of these sales are to major retailers that possess significant economic substance  the arrangements consist of payment terms of days  and the customers obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product in the retail channel 
for distributor customers  collectibility is deemed probable and we recognize revenue on the earlier to occur of when the distributor pays the invoice or when the distributor provides persuasive evidence that the product has been resold  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
allowances for price concessions and returns we are not contractually obligated to accept returns  except for defective product 
however  we grant price concessions to our key customers who are major retailers that control market access to the consumer when those concessions are necessary to maintain our relationships with the retailers and access to their retail channel customers 
if the consumers demand for a specific title falls below expectations or significantly declines below previous rates of sell through  then  we may negotiate a price concession or credit to spur further sales by the retailer to maintain the customer relationship 
we record revenue net of an allowance for estimated price concessions and returns 
we must make significant estimates and judgments when determining the appropriate allowance for price concessions and returns in any accounting period 
in order to derive and evaluate those estimates  we analyze historical price concessions and returns  current sell through of product and retailer inventory  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand and acceptance of our products in the marketplace  among other factors 

table of contents material differences in the amount and the timing of our revenue for any period may result if our judgments or estimates differ significantly from actual future events 
in fiscal  our net revenue increased by  when we reduced our august  accrued price concessions since actual sell through in the retail channel demonstrated that the allowances were not required 
allowances for price concessions and returns are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable when we have agreed to grant credits to the customer  otherwise  they are reflected as an accrued liability 
prepaid royalties we pay non refundable royalty advances to licensors of intellectual properties and classify those payments as prepaid royalties 
all royalty advance payments are recoupable against future royalties due for software or intellectual properties we licensed under the terms of our license agreements 
we expense prepaid royalties at contractual royalty rates based on actual product sales 
we also charge to expense the portion of prepaid royalties that we expect will not be recovered through future product sales 
material differences between actual future sales and those projected may result in the amount and timing of royalty expense to vary 
we classify royalty advances as current or noncurrent assets based on the portion of estimated future net product sales that are expected to occur within the next fiscal year 
capitalized software development costs we account for our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
under sfas no 
 we expense software development costs as incurred until we determine that the software is technologically feasible 
generally  to establish whether the software is technologically feasible  we require a proven game engine that has been successfully utilized in a previous product 
we assess its detailed program designs to verify that the working model of the game engine has been tested against the product design 
once we determine that the entertainment software is technologically feasible and we have a basis for estimating the recoverability of the development costs from future cash flows  we capitalize the remaining software development costs until the software product is released 
once we release a software title  we commence amortizing the related capitalized software development costs 
we record amortization expense as a component of cost of revenue 
we calculate the amortization of a software title s capitalized software development costs using two different methods  and then amortize the greater of the two amounts 
under the first method  we divide the current period gross revenue for the released title by the total of current period gross revenue and anticipated future gross revenue for the title and then multiply the result by the title s total capitalized software development costs 
under the second method  we divide the title s total capitalized costs by the number of periods in the title s estimated economic life up to a maximum of three months 
material differences between our actual gross revenue and those we project may result in the amount and timing of amortization to vary 
if we deem a title s capitalized software development costs unrecoverable based on our expected future gross revenue and corresponding cash flows  we write off the costs and record a charge to development expense or cost of revenue  as appropriate

the increase in the net provision for price concessions and returns resulted primarily from an increase in gross revenue for fiscal 
table of contents over fiscal  an increase in the average number of units per software title shipped into the retail channel  reductions from the fiscal positive retail sell through rates of our products as well as a million provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on lower than historical retail sell through rates and a higher than historical provision rate for turok evolution and aggressive inline  which products were released in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of software titles for the top three game systems accounted for of gross revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal we achieved the greatest level of sales from software titles released for playstation which to date has the highest installed base of the three game systems 
increased unit volume contributed million to the increase in net revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal  while higher average selling prices contributed the remaining million 
please see discussion of gross profit 
products developed by our internal studios generated of our gross revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to turok evolution  which represented of our gross revenue for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  net revenue of million increased by million  or  from million for fiscal the increase in gross revenue was driven by sales of newly released software titles for the playstation  playstation and game boy game systems 
the decrease in the net provision for price concessions and returns for fiscal resulted primarily from an improved market reception and increased rates of retail sell through for a majority of the software titles we released in fiscal  the shift in titles released for the nintendo platform to the then newly introduced playstation platform and less quantities per title shipped into the retail channel  all of which resulted in significantly lower price concessions and returns related to products shipped in fiscal in addition  the fiscal provision was favorably impacted by a change in the fiscal estimate of the provision for price concessions and returns 
in fiscal  we expected particularly low rates of retail channel sell through of bit product because of the continuous decline of the market for bit products during the period  the decline of the market for dreamcast software and sega s exit from the hardware market and the introduction of the next generation playstation consoles in october during fiscal  the accelerated hardware transition that had commenced in fiscal reversed course and began to slow due to production delays experienced by sony in the manufacture of its playstation because playstation products were not available in the marketplace at the quantities we had expected  our bit product  dreamcast product and other related and marked down products in the retail channel continued to sell through at higher rates and with lower price concessions than we had forecasted 
accordingly  in fiscal  we did not need to provide any additional sales allowances for bit products and we reduced our august  accrued price concessions by million 
gross profit gross profit is derived from net revenue after deducting cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of product manufacturing costs primarily disc and manufacturing royalty costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs and fees paid to third party distributors for games sold overseas 
our gross profit is significantly affected by the sales mix between disc based and cartridge based game software as disc based game software has a significantly lower manufacturing cost than cartridge based software

fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  gross profit of million of net revenue increased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the increased gross profit was due to higher playstation  xbox  and gamecube disc based software sales volume  partially offset by a higher provision for price concessions and returns  including million related to turok evolution and aggressive inline please see discussion of net revenue and an million increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs particularly related to turok evolution and all star baseball for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was as compared to for fiscal the percentage point decrease resulted primarily from an million or five fold increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs compared to the prior year amount of million  lower margin off price sales of catalog game software to designated customers in a new distribution channel created in fiscal and sales of newly released game titles in the rental market 
for fiscal  amortization of capitalized software development costs amounted to million as compared to million for fiscal capitalized software development costs  net  amounted to million as of august  and million as of august  gross profit in fiscal will depend in large part on the rate of growth of the software market for bit game consoles sony s playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox and our ability to identify  develop and timely publish  in accordance with our product release schedule  software that sells through at projected levels at retail 
see factors affecting future performance our ability to meet cash requirements and maintain necessary liquidity rests in part on the cooperation of our primary lender and vendors  and our ability to achieve our projected revenue levels and reduce operating expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  gross profit of million of net revenue increased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the increased gross profit was due to significant playstation and playstation software sales volume and the decreased dependency on bit cartridge based products 
please see discussion of net revenue 
for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was as compared to for fiscal the percentage point increase resulted primarily from the strategic transformation of our operating business 
table of contents model from cartridge based to disc based product 
costs of disc based product as a percentage of net revenue were lower because with this type of product  we were able to lower inventory levels and increase turnover rates due to a decrease in order lead time to seven to fourteen days for disc based product from six to eight weeks for cartridge based product and reduce per unit product manufacturing costs as disc based product costs approximately per unit on average as compared to per unit on average for cartridge based product

fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  marketing and selling expenses of million of net revenue increased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the increase was primarily related to expenses incurred to help generate and support higher net revenue in fiscal the increased marketing and selling expenditures did not have as positive an effect on fiscal net revenue as we had expected  which resulted in a percentage point increase in marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
expense increases included million in advertising and trade show expenses  million in licensing costs  million in cooperative advertising expenses and million in sales commissions 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction of accrued expenses for obligations that ceased under several expired intellectual property agreements and a million recovery of previously expensed licensing fees 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  marketing and selling expenses of million of net revenue decreased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the decrease related primarily to reductions in tv advertising and print media expenses related to our plan to refocus and limit these discretionary expenditures 
during fiscal  we limited funding of tv and media advertising because our estimate of the installed base of game platforms in north america was not deemed sufficient to allow marketing expenditures to be cost effective

fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  general and administrative expenses of million of net revenue increased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses due to increased headcount 
as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the percentage point improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from managed cost containment measures as well as economies of scale achieved due to the increases in net revenue for fiscal over fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  general and administrative expenses of million of net revenue decreased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the decrease was due primarily to cost reduction efforts initiated in the second half of fiscal  which were accomplished primarily by reducing administrative employee headcount by to as of august  from as of may  research and development research and development expenses consist of employee related and occupancy costs associated with our internal studios as well as contractual external software development costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  research and development expenses of million of net revenue increased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in internal and external development costs  the internal costs associated with a greater number of personnel to develop a greater number of titles  and a million write off of software development costs previously capitalized as we ceased developing the related game titles because they were no longer considered economically viable 
these expense increases were partially offset by a million increase in the amount of software development costs capitalized because of the greater number of software titles under development that met the test of technological feasibility please see discussion of capitalized software development costs under critical accounting policies 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  research and development expenses of million of net revenue decreased by million  or  from million of net revenue for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of titles under development
