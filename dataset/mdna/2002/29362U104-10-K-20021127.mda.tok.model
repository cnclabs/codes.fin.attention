overview entegris  inc is a leading provider of materials integrity management products and services that protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris was incorporated in june to effect the business combination of fluoroware  inc  which began operating in  and empak  inc  which began operating in the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the historical financial statements of entegris include the historical accounts and results of operations of fluoroware and empak and their respective subsidiaries  as if the business combination had existed for all periods presented 
entegris primarily derives its revenue from the sale of products to the semiconductor and data storage industries and generally recognizes sales upon the shipment of such goods to customers 
cost of sales includes polymers and purchased components  manufacturing personnel  supplies and fixed costs related to depreciation and operation of facilities and equipment 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers and are served through various subsidiaries and sales and distribution relationships in the united states  asia and europe 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last saturday of august 
the last three fiscal years ended on the following dates august   august  and august  fiscal comprises weeks  while fiscal years and included weeks 
fiscal years are identified in this report according to the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended august  is alternatively referred to as fiscal or 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  warranty and sales return obligations  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are discussed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as reserves for sales returns and allowances  and warranty claims 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management analyzes the age of receivable balances  historical bad debts write off experience  customer concentrations  general customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
at august  and august   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
a reserve for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at august  and august   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in the company s warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at august  and august   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of standard manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical loss trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off 
in addition  reserves are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
at august  and august   inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
the company s inventories comprise materials and products subject to technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current analyses  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following o significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  o significant negative industry or economic trends  and o significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value  the company s marketable equity securities are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other than temporary 
at august   the company s investment in metron technology nv had a carrying value of million with a fair value of million 
if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss will be recorded and the investment written down to a new cost basis 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
at august   the company carried a valuation allowance of million against its net deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for fiscal year  and the company s historical financial data were derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses nonrecurring charges operating loss profit interest income expense  net other income  net loss income before income taxes and other items below income tax expense benefit equity in net income of affiliates minority interest income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt  net of taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decline reflected the continuation of weakened business conditions in the semiconductor industry that began in the second half of fiscal  as the semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented deterioration in market conditions  with rapidly falling rates of factory utilization and reduced capital spending 
the sales decrease was attributable to softer demand for both fluid handling products  which generally depend on capital spending levels  and microelectronics products  which also depend on the manufacturing utilization of semiconductor industry 
although the company reported sequentially higher quarterly sales as fiscal progressed  fourth quarter revenues were still significantly below the record levels experienced in the first half of fiscal sales for the microelectronics group were down from fiscal and accounted for about of entegris sales 
fluid handling sales in were down from a year ago  making up of total sales 
revenue declines were recorded in all geographic regions  with approximately year to year declines experienced for north america  europe and japan  while sales to the asia pacific region fell just  which reflects a nominal decrease of microelectronics group product sales to that region 
overall  international sales accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal fiscal sales were to north america  to asia pacific  to europe and to japan 
based on current order rates  industry analyst expectations and other information  the company expects that sales for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately lower than sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  industry volatility and uncertain global market conditions make it difficult to forecast for future quarters 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal the company s gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal gross margin and gross profit declines were reported by both domestic and international operations 
the drop in fiscal figures was primarily caused by the lower sales levels noted above  which resulted in lower factory utilization 
gross profit levels generally improved throughout the year as sales increased sequentially by quarter 
partly offsetting the declines was the benefit of the company s actions in reducing costs and increasing manufacturing efficiencies associated with the closure of manufacturing plants  investing in automation  changing process flows and instituting manufacturing centers of excellence 
the company also recorded lower asset impairment charges in  incurring charges of million and million in and  respectively  mainly for asset write offs of molds 
as discussed above  the company cannot provide guidance about fiscal sales levels 
however  in general  gross profit and gross margin variances mainly track the utilization of the company s production capacity associated with varying sales levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline is primarily due to significantly lower incentive compensation and charitable contribution accruals  which are based on the company s results of operations  offset partly by increased expenditures for information systems and the continued building of the company s global infrastructure which began in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  increased to from with the impact of lower sg a expenses more than offset by the effect of lower net sales 
nonrecurring charges reversals 
in the first quarter of  the company s results included a nonrecurring charge of million in connection with the closures of the company s chanhassen  mn plant 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of employees and million for estimated losses for asset impairment

operating results in fiscal included two nonrecurring charges 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million related to the early termination of a distribution agreement and a million charge in connection with the closing of its castle rock  colorado and munmak  korea facilities

er d expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal in fiscal  the company s expenditures were focused on supporting current product lines  developing new manufacturing technologies and developing next generation products for new and existing markets 
interest income expense  net 
the company reported net interest income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change reflects the significantly lower rates of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments and a shift in the mix of such investments towards tax exempt debt securities 
other income  net 
other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other income in fiscal consisted primarily of the foreign currency gains  with about million associated with the realization of translation gains from the liquidation of the company s korean entity  while other income in fiscal included foreign currency translation gains offset by losses on sales of property and equipment 
income tax expense benefit 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the variance primarily reflects the significant difference in the company s pre tax operating results 
the income tax benefit in fiscal includes a one time benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from certain non us subsidiaries  while income tax expense in fiscal includes a million tax benefit associated with the closure of the company s korean manufacturing operations  losses of which were previously non deductible 
the company expects an effective tax rate of about in fiscal equity in net income of affiliates 
the company recorded no equity in the net income of affiliates in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  all of which was recorded in the first half of that fiscal year 
this reflects the change in accounting for the company s investment in metron technology nv metron  which was recorded under the equity method of accounting through the second quarter of fiscal at which time the company began accounting for its remaining investment as an available for sale equity security  as our percentage ownership in metron was reduced from to 
minority interest 
for fiscal  the minority interest in subsidiaries net loss was million  reflecting the operating losses of the company s formerly owned japanese subsidiaries in the first half of the year

net income decreased to million  or per share diluted  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  in fiscal excluding the effects of nonrecurring charges and reversals in fiscal and  pro forma diluted earnings per share declined to from per share in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were million in fiscal  flat when compared to million in fiscal the company reported record sales in the first half of  reflecting a continuation of strong business conditions in the semiconductor industry that began in the second half of however  incoming order rates began to decline rapidly late in the second quarter of for both fluid handling products  which are dependent on capital spending levels in the semiconductor industry  and microelectronics products  reflecting declining manufacturing utilization of wafer manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers 
consequently  the company experienced significantly lower sales over the last half of the year  resulting in level sales with falling order rates began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of fiscal increased sales in japan offset revenue declines in the north america and asia pacific regions  with european sales unchanged from one year ago 
overall  international sales accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal sales of fluid handling products  which made up of total sales  grew by  while microelectronics product sales  of total sales  fell slightly 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million  a small increase over the million reported in fiscal the minor improvement in fiscal partly reflect the benefit of integrating various elements of the company s manufacturing operations 
asset impairment charges of million and million were recorded in and  respectively  mainly for asset write offs of molds 
gross margin for fiscal improved to compared to for fiscal gross profit and gross margin variances mainly track the utilization of the company s production capacity associated with varying sales levels 
consequently  the company reported improved gross profits and gross margins in excess of during the first half of  but experienced declining gross profits and lower gross margins over the latter half of the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  increased to from 
the year to year increase is due to the cost of building the company s global infrastructure including the addition of direct sales forces in europe and asia  as well as the sg a expenses from acquired businesses 
fiscal also includes higher expenditures for information systems 
nonrecurring charges 
operating results in fiscal include two nonrecurring charges 
during the second quarter  the company recorded a charge of million related to the early termination of a distribution agreement for the microelectronics group with its affiliate  metron technology nv metron 
pursuant to the termination agreement  the company assumed direct sales responsibility for the microelectronics group product sales in europe and asia  and transferred to metron million shares of metron stock and agreed to make future cash payments totaling million 
entegris also agreed to buy back certain microelectronics product inventory from metron 
the company and metron also executed a new distribution agreement for entegris fluid handling group products  which now runs through august  during the third quarter  the company recorded a million charge in connection with the closing of its castle rock  colorado and munmak  korea facilities 
the charge includes million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of employees and million for estimated losses for asset disposals 
in addition  the charge includes million for future lease commitments on the castle rock facility  the lessor of which is a major shareholder of the company 
engineering  research and development expenses er d 
er d expenses increased to million in fiscal  up from million in er d expense  as a percent of net sales  rose to in from in fiscal a major element of fiscal er d costs relates to the continued development of next generation mm products 
interest income expense  net

other income  net 
other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the absence of the million gain recognized in fiscal on the sale of approximately  shares of the company s investment in metron

all adjustments which management considers necessary for the fair presentation of the unaudited information have been included in the quarters presented 
from mid through the second quarter of fiscal  the company reported steadily improving net sales  primarily resulting from improved market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
as sales grew  gross profits and margins improved principally due to improved utilization of production capacity  and often a more favorable product sales mix 
during the last two quarters of fiscal and through fiscal  the company s sales levels fell to well below those reported in the first half of  reflecting the downturn in the global semiconductor industry  including significant cutbacks in industry capital spending 
quarterly sales levels improved sequentially through fiscal  but were still nearly lower than sales experienced in the first half of consequently  the company experienced lower utilization in its manufacturing operations  leading to generally lower gross profits and earnings in net income in the second quarter of fiscal includes a pretax charge of million related to the termination of a distribution agreement

book value per share was  up from per share at the end of fiscal the impact of net earnings and proceeds from the issuance of shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans was offset partly by a million change in accumulated comprehensive income loss and the effect of additional common shares outstanding 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris s principal market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s current exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
most of its outstanding debt at august  carried fixed rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are debt instruments with maturities of months or less 
a change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the sale of products in currencies other than the us dollar 
at august  the company was party to forward contracts with notional value of million 
the cash flows and earnings of foreign based operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
the company s investment in metron common stock is accounted for as an available for sale security 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of metron stock 
a adverse change in metron s per share price would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s investment as of august  impact of inflation the company s financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of polymers  its primary raw material  was essentially unchanged from one year ago 
entegris expects the cost of resins to remain stable in the foreseeable future 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose modestly in fiscal moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal item a
