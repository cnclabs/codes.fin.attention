net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the principal source of the company s revenues 
versus net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or from this increase is attributable to a increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the net interest margin to in from in the increase in the net interest margin and net interest income was primarily the result of the following 
due to the declining interest rate environment  the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to while the cost of deposits and other borrowed funds decreased basis points to for the federal reserve reduced interest rates in eleven times for a total of basis points 
since the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities repriced more quickly than its loans and investments  the margin benefited from the reduction in interest rates over 
total average earning assets increased million or as compared to average loans grew million or  in comparison to the increase is primarily attributable to growth in construction loans million  commercial real estate mortgages million  home equity loans million and commercial loans million offset by a decrease in residential mortgages million 
see loans for further details of yields by loan type 

the company s average securities portfolio decreased by million primarily due to maturities and calls of us treasury and government agency securities 
the proceeds received on sales  maturities  calls and paydowns during were partially reinvested in the securities portfolio and also used to fund loan growth 

average interest bearing deposits and other liabilities increased million or as compared to average interest bearing deposits increased million due to retail deposit promotions and the opening of the chicago office in average fhlb borrowings increased million and average short term debt decreased million due to the maturity of term repurchase agreements 
in addition  the company has million outstanding in trust preferred capital securities issued in a million pooled trust preferred offering in september versus on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income for totaled  an increase of over this increase is attributable to a increase in average earning assets offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin to in from in the increase in net interest income and the compression of the net interest margin was primarily the result of the following 
during  average loans increased million primarily in the indirect million  commercial real estate million  home equity million  commercial million and residential real estate million loan portfolios 
the increase in volume was complemented by a basis point increase in rates  primarily due to the growth in commercial  commercial real estate and home equity loans 
see loans for further details of yields by loan type 

the company also increased its average portfolio of securities by million primarily in us government agency securities up million 
as funds were received on maturities  calls and paydowns  the proceeds were re directed into the higher yielding agency portfolio or used to fund higher yielding loan demand 

due to the rising interest rate environment  the average yield on loans  investments and other earning assets increased basis points as compared to the average cost on deposit and other liabilities increasing basis points 
the federal reserve raised interest rates three times during and once late in and since the company s liabilities repriced more quickly than its assets  the margin was squeezed 

higher rate time deposits increased million and money market accounts increased million  while lower rate savings and now accounts decreased by million 
to fund the loan growth  the company ran successful retail deposit promotions during the year 
in addition  short term debt increased primarily due to more treasury  tax and loan funds 
these are us government short term deposits of tax collections received by the us treasury from taxpayers

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  historical losses experienced by the industry  value of the underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the company s charge off policy varies with respect to the category of and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
the company records charge offs on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of collectibility 
in addition  any loans which are classified as loss in regulatory examinations are completely charged off and loans classified as doubtful are charged off at 
the company records specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans when a loan is considered to be impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on an evaluation of current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due principal and interest pursuant to the original contractual terms 
the company measures impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage  home equity  indirect vehicle and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and not subject to impaired loan disclosures 
interest income on impaired loans is recognized using the cash basis method

the company s allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans outstanding was 
at december  as compared to 
in and 
in the provision for loan losses is sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based upon management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at an adequate level 
management of the bank prepares a detailed analysis  at least quarterly  reviewing the adequacy of its allowance and  when appropriate  recommending an increase or decrease in its provision for loan losses 
the analysis to determine the allocated portion of the allowance is divided into two parts 
the first part involves primarily an estimated calculation of losses on specific problem and management watch list loans  the remaining credit card portfolio and delinquent consumer loans 
the second part involves primarily a calculation of the bank s actual net charge off history averaged with industry net charge off history by major loan categories 
in addition  in determining the unallocated portion of the reserve  the bank considers its portfolio composition  loan growth  management capabilities  economic trends  credit concentrations  industry risks  underlying collateral values and the opinions of bank management and involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
accordingly  because each of these criteria is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
in order to identify potential risks in the loan portfolio and determine the necessary provision for loan losses  detailed information is obtained from the following sources 
regular reports prepared by the bank s management which contain information on the overall characteristics of the loan portfolio  including delinquencies and nonaccruals  and specific analysis of loans requiring special attention ie watch lists  
examinations of the loan portfolio of the subsidiary bank by federal and state regulatory agencies  and 
reviews by third party credit review consultants 
the following table considers both parts of the analysis discussed above to determine the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type for each of the last five years

included in the allocated allowance for construction  land acquisition and development loans is a specific allowance of  on an impaired loan on nonaccrual status with a balance of  at december  the actual loss the company may incur could be more or less than the specific allocation 
the allocation for commercial loans increased from due to an increase in management s watch list for commercial loans as a result of the economic downturn 
nonperforming assets the accrual of interest is discontinued on commercial  real estate and consumer loans when the continuity of contractual principal or interest is deemed doubtful by management or when days or more past due and the loan is not well secured or in the process of collection 
interest income is recorded on these loans only as it is collected 
interest payments on nonaccrual loans which contain unusual risk features or marginal collateral values may be applied directly to loan principal for accounting purposes

while total treasury management services increased over  the amounts presented here represent cash fees paid by customers 
these cash fees increased due to new customer volume  increased prices and more customers paying a portion of their fees in cash rather than maintaining a larger deposit balance necessary to offset the declining earnings credit 
included in this category is one significant customer which is under contract with the bank until june of in addition to treasury management fees  retail fee income also increased slightly primarily due to higher fees for online banking  debit card and atm usage

in addition  mutual fund sweep income increased to  in from  in due primarily to increased volume 
the gain recognized on investment securities sold was  in included in the gross gains were gains of  from sales of million of trust preferred securities 
the remaining  in gains were recognized from the sales of million of us treasury and government agency securities 
none of the individual securities sold in resulted in a loss 
versus service charges on deposit accounts increased  primarily due to an increase in treasury management fees 
these fees increased due to new customer volume including one very significant customer added late in  which resulted in a full year of fees in as compared to two months of fees in in addition to treasury management fees  retail fee income also increased primarily due to higher fees for online banking  debit card and atm usage 
investment management and trust department income increased  primarily due to an increase in investment assets under management and other new trust business offset by decreases in the equity market which affect the fees earned on trust accounts

salaries and employee benefits increased  due to normal salary and benefit increases and higher compensation due to competitive market conditions 
the increase in salaries is partially offset by a decrease in management bonuses 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  due primarily to the opening of the new branches in lagrange september and chicago november advertising and business development fees increased  due primarily to an advertising and public relations campaign to publicize the capabilities of the investment management and trust department and retail advertising and promotions related to the opening of the new chicago branch 
merchant credit card interchange expense increased  due to new merchant accounts and increased volume

the accounting policies underlying the recognition of income taxes in the balance sheets and statements of income are included in notes and to item of this form k 
in accordance with such policies  the company records income tax expense benefits in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fas pursuant to these rules  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
net deferred tax assets totaling  at december  are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
under fas  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  the company considers the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  and future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
based on this assessment  a valuation allowance is not required for any of the deferred tax assets 
financial condition liquidity effective management of balance sheet liquidity is necessary to fund growth in earning assets and to pay liability maturities  depositors withdrawal requirements  shareholders dividends and to purchase treasury stock under stock repurchase programs

interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk arises when the maturity or repricing of assets differs significantly from the maturity or repricing of liabilities 
the company s financial results could be affected by changes in market interest rates such as the prime rate  libor and treasury yields and rate competition for deposits 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to provide the maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulation  rate shock analysis and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
an income simulation model is the primary tool we use to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the model incorporates management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  money market  now and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of loans and mortgage related assets in each rate environment are captured using estimates of prepayment speeds for the portfolios 
other assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of other financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  and customer preferences 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the company uses rate shock analysis to evaluate the effects of various parallel shifts in market interest rates  upward or downward  on net interest income relative to a base rate scenario where market interest rates remain flat at december year end levels 
the interest rate sensitivity presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period and ii that changes in market interest rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve 
this analysis is limited by the fact that it does not include any balance sheet repositioning actions the company may take should severe movements in interest rates occur such as lengthening or shortening the duration of the securities portfolio 
these actions would likely reduce the variability of net interest income in extreme interest rate shock forecasts 
in the past the rate shock analyses have shown that the company is liability sensitive  that is interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets and this generally results in the net interest margin increasing in a falling rate environment and decreasing in a rising rate environment 
however  an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates may not result in an immediate  identical increase or decrease in rates paid on non maturing  non indexed interest bearing liabilities such as savings  money market and now accounts 
core deposit rates are internally controlled and generally exhibit less sensitivity to changes in interest rates than the adjustable rate assets and liabilities whose yields or cost of funds are based on external indices and change in concert with market interest rates 
additionally  in the current very low interest rate environment  if market rates decrease  the rates paid on deposit liabilities could not reflect the full amount of the decrease since rates are already so low 
if rates increase  rates paid on deposits may not reflect the full extent of the rate increase until rates approach a more historical level 
the company s policy objective is to limit the change in annual net interest income to from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates rate shock of basis points 
as a result of absolute interest rates being so low rates on fed funds  the three month treasury  libor and rates paid on certain core deposits are all below  the company assumed rates will probably not decline basis points 
the scale shown below has been changed for december  to a more meaningful plus or minus and basis point rate shock 
as of december  and the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile 
bp bp bp bp bp bp dollars in thousands annual net interest income change from an immediate change in rates   percent change 


the following gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
the mismatch between asset and liability repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
the gap report does not fully capture the true dynamics of interest rate changes including the timing and or degree of interest rate changes 
while most of the asset categories rates change when certain independent indices such as the prime rate change  most liability categories are repriced at the company s discretion subject  however  to competitive interest rate pressures 
the table below presents a static gap analysis as of december  which shows the company s rate sensitive liabilities may reprice more quickly than its rate sensitive assets 
in addition  the gap report does not reflect the call associated with certain investment assets  which if called  significantly reduces the negative cumulative gap for the time periods of one year or less

the lease agreements represent outstanding obligations of lease payments on the six real properties leased by the company 
the following tables represent the company s contractual obligations one year one to four to or less three years five years over years dollars in thousands long term debt     operating lease obligations the company does not have any capital leases or long term purchase obligations 
commercial commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  including commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit collectively commitments that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments is limited to their contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
specifically  the home equity lines are reviewed annually and the bank has the ability to deny any future extensions of credit based upon the borrowers continued credit worthiness 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional guarantees of payment to a third party on behalf of a customer of the company 
these commitments are subject to the same credit policies followed for loans recorded in the financial statements

the average maturity of this segment of the portfolio was years in compared to years in included in this portfolio are million in securities with coupon rates ranging from to with the potential of being called away in municipal securities the company s municipal security holdings decreased million to million at year end from million at year end the decrease is primarily due to scheduled maturities and calls on securities due to the lower rate environment
