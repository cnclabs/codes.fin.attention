item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows asset valuations and review for potential impairments our review of our long lived assets  principally fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  as described in note to the accompanying financial statements  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  determined by third party and internal appraisals and valuations  as deemed appropriate  or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cashflows  discount rates and reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future sales and margin  operating  selling and administrative costs  interest and discount rates  technological changes  consumer demand and governmental regulations 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
environmental and litigation contingencies we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence reserves the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  this may result in an impairment of their ability to make payments to the company  and additional allowances may be required 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs deemed necessary by management

the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on gross sales for the year had a negative impact on sales of or  compared to gross sales would have been  using exchange rates compared to sales of the unfavorable effects of foreign currencies are attributable primarily to exchange rate fluctuations in the italian lira  swedish krona  pounds sterling and irish punt against the us dollar in the human health segment gross sales of  were  above due primarily to higher sales of generics used in cardiovascular  central nervous systems and gastrointestinal preparations and new product introductions  including an intermediate used in a product to treat end stage kidney disease and actives used in insomnia and prostate cancer treatment products 
these increases were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies which reduced sales by or million  and lower sales of a cardiovascular supplement  due to a price decrease 
this price decrease was offset by lower manufacturing cost reflecting a change in chemical processing 
in addition  lower sales were experienced in a generic used in the treatment of ulcertative colitis due to competitive pricing pressure and in a gastrointestinal active due to a customer decision to bring manufacturing in house 
the biosciences segment gross sales of  were  above primarily due to the acquisition of bio science in june  and marathon in october  as well as increased shipments of cell culture  including liquid media  flex pack and powder formulations 
in addition  endotoxin detection sales increased due to more focused marketing and production efforts 
the animal health agriculture segment gross sales of  were  below this decrease was mainly due to lower sales of animal health and certain crop protection products  primarily nitro  cyanopyridine and pyridine derivatives 
the specialty and fine chemicals segment gross sales of  were  below due to lower sales in telecommunications  coatings  performance enhancing products and weak photographic demand 
reduced sales in telecommunications and coating products have been influenced by a general economic slowdown in those industries 
in addition  lower sales of a polycarbonate additive were due to a customer decision to move production in house 
export sales from us businesses of  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in total gross profit of  was  above due to increased gross profit in the bioscience segment  due to higher volume in the base businesses  and the impact of two contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing acquisitions completed during the year 
the human health segment also benefited from dollars in thousands  except share data increased volume  as well as favorable product mix 
these increases resulted despite special charges for inventory write offs recorded in the fourth quarter of million in the bioscience segment and million in the human health segment for discontinued products manufactured at rutherford chemical facilities see note 
the bioscience segment inventory write off was related to excess and obsolete inventories 
the higher gross profits in the life science segments were partly offset by lower gross profits and margins in the specialty and fine chemical and animal health agricultural segments  both of which were primarily impacted by lower volumes 
in addition  the animal health agricultural segment was impacted by increased raw material and energy costs during the year 
the overall gross margin of  including the fourth quarter inventory write downs of million  was approximately flat compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in versus for administration costs increased due to the added costs and higher amortization expense associated with the june bio science contract production corporation acquisition  the full year impact of the august arizona product line license and october marathon acquisition  as well as additional sales and marketing costs in the bioscience segment

the company increased its provision for potential settlements and legal costs related to vitamin b litigation by million 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and were above levels by million or of gross sales 
this increase was associated with the strengthening of the r d group in the biosciences segment and costs associated with the expansion of the cambrex center of technical excellence 
the operating profit in was  a decrease of excluding the effect of the restructuring and other charges  inventory write downs and the vitamin b accrual compared to this decrease  excluding the special charges  primarily reflects weakness in the gross margin and profit in the non life science businesses  higher research and development spending and amortization costs associated with acquisitions 
this decrease is partly offset by the higher gross profit in the life science businesses

these increases were partially offset by lower sales of gastro intestinal products and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency which reduced segment sales 
the company also eliminated certain lower margin x ray products which were under pricing pressure 
the biosciences segment gross sales of  were  above primarily due to the acquisition of biowhittaker molecular applications  inc formerly the bioproducts business of fmc corporation in july  as well as increased shipments of cell culture and electrophoresis products 
the segment sales were lower as a result of decreased emphasis on serum and allergy diagnostic sales coupled with supply issues for lal endotoxin detection and certain cell products 
the animal health agriculture segment gross sales of  were above this increase was mainly due to increased sales of agricultural intermediates  primarily cyanopyridine and pyridine derivatives 
animal health products were also above due to increased shipments of a poultry feed additive 
these increases were partially offset by lower vitamin b sales due to reduced shipments to the animal feed markets and lower prices compared to the specialty and fine chemicals segment gross sales of  were  below due to lower specialty additive revenues used in plastic resins and fuel oil  castor oil based products sold to the commodity markets  and encapsulants used in telecommunications 
export sales from us businesses of  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in total gross profit of  was  above due to the improved gross margin on the human health segment sales due primarily to increased volume  favorable product mix and lower spending  the biosciences segments operating efficiencies and full year impact of the second quarter acquisition of biowhittaker molecular applications 
these increases were partially offset by declines in the animal health agriculture segment  due to plant operational problems  higher raw material and energy costs  and the specialty and fine chemicals segment due primarily to lower plant volume

the company s net income in increased to  compared with net income of  in excluding the impact of the  vitamin b accrual in 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the decrease in cash flow is primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and higher prepaid expenses  partially offset by lower inventory purchases and lower accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses reflects vitamin b payments  lower inventory purchases  as well as the timing of various liability payments 
cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures of  and the acquisitions of bio science contract production corporation and marathon biopharmaceuticals for  cash flows provided from financing activities of  included net borrowings of debt of  payments of  in dividends and the purchase of treasury stock of  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures were  in   in and  in in  part of the funds were used for a water treatment plant at profarmaco srl in italy  a laboratory upgrade at the nordic synthesis ab facility in sweden  operating and financial systems upgrades at the biowhittaker facility in maryland and a number of miscellaneous plant upgrades throughout the company 
on november   the company obtained new credit facilities from a group of banks led by jpmorganchase as lead arranger and administrative agent 
the credit facilities provide for an aggregate amount of million  consisting of a day renewable  senior revolving credit facility for  and a year senior revolving credit facility in the amount of  the year agreement will expire in november the new agreements renew and extend the approximately million of existing bank debt which was scheduled to mature in september this agreement permits the company to choose between various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by specific interest rate options 
under the agreement  the interest rate options available to the company are a us prime rate or b libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 
or c money market rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 

the applicable margin is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of the company

in june the company borrowed approximately million to finance the acquisition of the bio science contract production corporation bio science manufacturing business in baltimore  maryland 
the company also borrowed approximately million to finance the acquisition of copharma  inc marathon located in hopkinton  massachusetts in october the undrawn borrowing availability under the agreement as of december  was  there was  outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands  except share data at december  our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows and total thereafter long term debt       operating leases       contractual cash obligations       see notes and in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and other commitments 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our strong long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of net worth  an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratios 
the company met all bank covenants during and does not anticipate any covenant compliance issues in the coming year 
management also believes that the company will maintain its strong long term credit ratings 
any events which change the status of our ability to meet debt covenants or maintain our credit ratings could adversely impact our ability to fund operations 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro currency  and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the net notional amount of these contracts at december   excluding  of inter company contracts  was  which the company estimates to be approximately of the non local currency exposure during the period 
unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
given the unlikely scenario that the operating companies non local currency collections match their forecast  and that all exchange rates move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on a non hedged risk of  this residual risk allows for an over forecasting margin of error and prevents over hedging of actual operating risk 
as of december   the combined non local currency forecasted net collections amounted to  offsetting this exposure are the expected  us dollar inter company payments from the combined european sites 
the remaining  forecasted exposure was partially hedged  with major banks to reduce the non hedged risk to  dollars in thousands  except share data interest rate management each of the interest rate options in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining market 
however  it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
for example  based on the company s current net debt outstanding  an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and thus decrease the company s after tax profitability by  the company has employed a plan to control interest rate risk 
to limit the risk of interest rates rising above a tolerable level  the company would pay a premium now in order to obtain a fixed interest rate at a predetermined cost in the future 
that premium  or swap  stabilizes interest costs by converting floating or variable rates to fixed rates through a contract with a financial institution 
we monitor the company s debt position and market trends to protect it from any unforeseen shifts in interest rates 
as of december   the company had ten interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average rate of  and with varying maturity dates through the year the company s strategy has been to cover approximately of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
at december   the coverage is approximately as the company is considering several fixed rate financial transactions which would increase the proportional amount of fixed rate debt 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company is a party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the company had accruals  included in current accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities  of  and  at december  and  respectively  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and the company s current and former operating sites for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents management s best estimate of what it believes are the reasonably possible and estimated environmental cleanup related costs of a non capital nature 
during the past three year period  cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters were  and for  and  respectively 
there were no provisions for environmental contingencies during the past three year period 
the company reduced reserves by approximately and  during and  respectively  as a result of revised estimates 
in addition  the company settled certain environmental claims involving the cosan chemical corporation a subsidiary with insurance companies for  in and  in after reviewing information currently available  management believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from those assumed in the current estimates could have a material adverse effect on financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
litigation the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl profarmaco were named as defendants in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc on december   in the united states district court for the district of columbia 
the complaint alleges that exclusive license agreements which profarmaco entered into with mylan laboratories  inc mylan covering the drug master files for and therefore the right to buy and use two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis  lorazepam and clorazepate  were part of an effort on mylan s part to restrict competition in the supply of lorazepam and clorazepate and to increase the price charged for these products when mylan sold them as generic pharmaceuticals 
the complaint further alleges that these agreements violate the federal trade commission dollars in thousands  except share data act  and that mylan  cambrex  profarmaco  and gyma laboratories of america  inc  profarmaco s distributor in the united states  engaged in an unlawful restraint of trade and cons red to monopolize and attempted to monopolize the markets for the generic pharmaceuticals incorporating the a s 
a lawsuit making similar allegations against the company and profarmaco  and seeking injunctive relief and treble damages  has been filed by the attorneys general of states in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of those states and persons in those states who were purchasers of the generic pharmaceuticals 
the company and profarmaco have also been named in purported class action complaints brought by private plaintiffs in various state courts on behalf of purchasers of lorazepam and clorazepate in generic form  making allegations essentially similar to those raised in the ftc s complaint and seeking various forms of relief including treble damages 
on february   a federal court in washington  dc entered an order and stipulated permanent injunction as part of a settlement of the ftc and attorneys general s suits 
under these settlement documents mylan agreed to pay over million on its own behalf and on behalf of most of the other defendant companies including cambrex and profarmaco 
in the order and injunction  the settling defendants also agreed to monitor certain future conduct 
the company strongly believes that its licensing arrangements with mylan were made in accordance with regulatory requirements and will vigorously defend the various other lawsuits and class actions 
the private litigation continues 
however  the company and mylan terminated the exclusive license to the drug master files as of december  in entering these licensing arrangements  the company elected not to raise the price of its products and had no control or influence over the pricing of its final generic product 
mylan had been fully covering the costs for the defense and indemnity of cambrex and profarmaco under certain obligations set forth in the license agreements 
cambrex agreed to cover separate legal defense costs incurred for cambrex and profarmaco on a going forward basis beginning august  these costs have not been and are not expected to be significant 
on may   the company s nepera subsidiary  a manufacturer and seller of niacinamide vitamin b  received a federal grand jury subpoena for the production of documents relating to the pricing and possible customer allocation with regard to that product 
the company understands that the subpoena was issued as part of the federal government s ongoing anti trust investigation into various business practices in the vitamin industry generally 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reached a settlement with the government concerning nepera s alleged role in vitamin b violations from to on october   the government settlement was finalized with nepera entering into a voluntary plea agreement with the department of justice 
under this agreement  nepera entered a plea of guilty to one count of price fixing and market allocation of vitamin b from to in violation of section one of the sherman act and has agreed to pay a fine of million 
under the plea agreement  nepera was on probation for a one year period which has ex red 
the fine was paid in february nepera has been named as a defendant  along with several other companies  in a number of private civil actions brought on behalf of alleged purchasers of vitamin b an accrual of million was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the anticipated government settlement  related litigation  and legal expenses 
based on recent discussions with various plaintiffs counsel  as well as current estimates of expenditures for legal fees  an additional accrual of million was established in the fourth quarter of as a result  the balance of this accrual as of december  was approximately million 
this accrual has been recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the above litigation matters and various other lawsuits  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
these matters  if resolved in an unfavorable manner  could have a material effect on the operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period
