industry background until the mid s  video images and audio soundtracks were transmitted  edited and stored almost exclusively using analog formats 
more recently  however  advances in technology have allowed audio and video to be processed and stored in digital form 
unlike analog formats  which are inherently unstable and difficult to edit and enhance  digital formats permit the manipulation of audio and video signals through digital signal processing and offer a number of fundamental advantages over analog technologies 
through complex digital signal processing operations  digital audio and video signals may be compressed  providing significant storage and transmission efficiencies 
they also may be filtered  allowing for noise reduction  and they may be transmitted and reproduced without perceptible image or sound degradation 
digital formats provide users with additional benefits  including random access to data  superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying and controlled and secure access 
one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of digital technology has been the huge amount of data required to represent images and sounds in a digital format  making cost effective storage or transmission impractical 
for example  storage of a two hour movie in uncompressed digital form would require approximately video cds 
through digital compression techniques a substantial number of the redundancies inherent in audio and video data can be identified and eliminated  significantly reducing the overall amount of data which needs to be retained 
compression techniques introduced in the early s allowed the same two hour movie which required video cds to be compressed and stored on only two video cds with video resolution comparable to that of a standard vhs tape 
more recent techniques allow the storage of a full length movie of more than three hours on a single dvd  with substantially improved audio and video quality and the incorporation of additional data  such as additional languages  scenes and director and actor commentary 
additionally  digital compression of video data allows previously unmanageable amounts of data to be stored in the memory of a standard personal computer  thereby permitting the data to be accessed and edited easily 
digital audio compression allows efficient storage and delivery of multi channel audio  making possible high quality special effects such as multi channel surround sound  virtual surround sound and wireless audio delivery via two speakers or headphones 
in the field of still photography  digital compression allows dozens or hundreds of digital pictures to be stored on a single memory card  depending on the resolution desired 
to drive the implementation and speed the adoption of products based on digital formats  industry participants organized committees to define international compression standards 
the principal standards in use today include the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  standard for the high quality compression of still images and the real time  low cost compression and decompression of moving images  the mpeg standard  adopted by the moving pictures experts group  or mpeg  for the compression of both audio and video data at the high compression ratios necessary for the limited storage capacity of the cd rom format  the mpeg standard  subsequently adopted by the motion pictures expert group  for the compression of both audio and video data  designed to provide improved quality in broadcast and video playback applications  the mpeg standard is an extension of mpeg and mpeg that provides the ability to view  access and manipulate objects rather than pixels  which is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  module multimedia and video game applications  and dolby ac  also known as dolby digital  developed by dolby laboratories  an industry standard for the compression of audio for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 
these industry standard techniques have enabled the dramatic growth in a variety of digital multimedia markets  including dvd players 
dvd players use mpeg video compression and dolby digital audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with vcr or video cd technology 
according to cahners in stat group  a market research firm  worldwide sales of dvd players are expected to grow from million units in to million units in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
filmless digital cameras 
filmless digital cameras use jpeg compression technology to capture high resolution images that can be viewed  edited and stored on a computer system and transmitted over telephone lines and computer networks 
according to cahners in stat group  sales of megapixel digital cameras are expected to grow from million units in to million units in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
pc video systems 
jpeg based pc video systems are used to capture and cut and paste video sequences and add special audio and video effects 
the growth in the desktop video editing market has slowed in recent years 
however  according to cahners in stat group  the demand for pc tv tuners that incorporate universal serial bus  or usb  connectors is expected to grow from  units in to million units in  a compound annual growth rate of 
digital audio systems 
dolby digital and other audio compression techniques are used in multi channel surround sound products including movie theater sound systems  audio video receivers and digital speakers 
according to data gathered from cahners in stat group  the demand for digital audio systems is expected to grow from  units in to million units in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
additional products and markets are developing based on these established compression standards as well as emerging compression technologies such as mlp  a new standard for dvd audio  and mp  a compression standard for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
these established and emerging compression standards specify data formats in which compressed data must be presented in order to enable products from different vendors to interact and permit the capture  transmission  storage and display of audio and video data in digital format 
these standards do not specify the compression methodologies to be employed or additional functionality which may be used to enhance or manipulate digital signals 
these standards  therefore  do not determine image or sound quality or compression efficiency 
for example  data compression may comply with relevant standards despite being poorly processed and containing artifacts which result in image degradation in video applications or poor sound quality in audio applications 
as a result there can be significant differences in overall image or sound quality between two solutions based on the same standard 
therefore  integrated circuit manufacturers can differentiate their products on the basis of the quality of their compression solution 
historically  as system vendors sought compression solutions  the cost  complexity  and time required to compress and decompress data have imposed significant limitations on the use of digital compression 
over the last several years  as cost effective compression solutions have emerged  product manufacturers have increasingly sought to design and market lower cost digital audio and video systems and products to address high volume consumer applications 
in addition  product manufacturers are facing competitive pressure to introduce their products more rapidly 
to address these issues  oems seek to integrate multiple functions on individual chips in order to reduce their costs  speed time to market and produce smaller products with reduced power consumption 
they also seek solutions that can be easily integrated into their commercial and consumer products 
the current challenge to manufacturers of compression integrated circuits is  therefore  to provide product manufacturers with high quality  cost effective  standards based solutions that deliver flexible control  image enhancement  audio effects and other functions in addition to high quality compression solutions 
the zoran solution we provide feature rich  cost effective  standards based solutions for a broad range of digital video and audio applications 
we were a pioneer in the development of high performance digital signal processor products  and have developed expertise in digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  mathematical algorithms and software development  as well as proprietary digital signal processing  video and audio compression technologies

integrated system solutions 
we help our customers meet their total system requirements by providing integrated products that combine hardware and software to address required system functions and features on a single integrated circuit or chip set  reducing the number of integrated circuits  and in some cases providing a complete solution on a single chip 
as a result  our customers total system cost can be reduced and they can concentrate on differentiating their products from those of their competitors 
for example  we introduced the camera on a chip  or coach  which includes most of the electronics of a filmless digital camera 
we also offer the cmos sensor that is tightly integrated with coach 
by delivering a camera on a chip with the cmos sensor  we enable our customers to reduce the costs of their products and focus on providing products that meet the needs of their end users 
cost effective products 
we focus on reducing the feature size  power requirements and number of integrated circuits necessary to perform required system functions  including compression functions 
this reduces our customers manufacturing costs for their products which incorporate our integrated circuits  and also reduces the operating costs for these products  enabling the use of our products in a broader range of high volume applications 
the modular nature of our architecture reduces our new product development costs  and enables our design engineers to meet our customers new product specification and cost parameters 
copy ready system reference designs 
we provide our customers with a broad range of engineering reference boards and products complete with device driver software  embedded software and detailed schematics 
these products substantially shorten our customers product design time

extend technological leadership 
our years of experience in the fields of digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  algorithms and software development have enabled us to become a leader in the development of digital audio and video solutions enabled by compression 
using our multi disciplinary expertise  we have developed new technologies for compression of digital audio and video 
for example  our proprietary bit rate control technology has helped us provide reliable and inexpensive jpeg based video compression  and our proprietary virtual multi channel digital  or vmd  technology enables high quality surround sound effects from two low cost audio speakers  rather than the four or five speakers required by other technologies 
during  we acquired pixelcam inc  which enabled us to develop a competitive advantage by combining our camera on a chip  or coach  processor with pixelcam s cmos sensor  providing a more integrated system 
furthermore  during we acquired nogatech inc  which provided us with low cost pc connectivity and mpeg technologies 
we intend to continue to invest in our own research and development  and to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional technologies in order to maintain and extend our technological leadership 
expand strategic partnerships 
we work closely in the product development process with leading manufacturers of products that incorporate our integrated circuits 
we also work closely with key customers and provide them early access to our technologies 
potential products are designed to meet customer driven product requirements defined jointly by us and our partners with the partner providing technological input and  in selected cases  a portion of the development funding 
this strategy has enabled us to develop products with substantial financial and other assistance while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the product once development is completed 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
we have also established long term relationships with strategic partners that provide manufacturing capacity and will seek to develop additional strategic relationships with manufacturers 
markets and applications our products are currently used in a variety of consumer multimedia and pc applications 
video playback systems currently  three types of digital video playback systems are available for consumer video applications video cd players  super video cd players and dvd players 
video cd players are essentially cd audio players with mpeg decoders and a video output 
video cd players offer video playback of near vcr quality and two channel stereo audio playback 
compression enables to minutes of video to be stored on a single cd 
video cd players can also play karaoke titles and were particularly popular in china  although we believe that the volume for these players have declined 
we formerly sold mpeg based products to manufacturers of stand alone video cd players but are no longer selling these products for this market 
in  the chinese government adopted the super video cd standard 
by utilizing mpeg compression technology as well as graphics  super video cd offers substantially higher audio and video quality than is possible with a video cd player 
the super video cd standard that replaced video cd in china is  in turn  being replaced by dvd players 
dvd players  the latest generation of video playback systems  use mpeg video compression and dolby digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with vcrs  video cd or super video cd players 
dvd players are sold as stand alone products and are now also being bundled with other functions including dvd vcr combinations  dvd receivers and dvd tv combinations 
in addition  the dvd player can act as a platform for connecting digital cameras so that the player becomes the playback mechanism for digital still images 
dvd players are also included in place of cd rom drives in some newer pcs  where they are referred to as dvd roms 
dvd roms are also sold as upgrade products 
the growth in the dvd market is demonstrated by the rapidly growing sales of dvd players  the increasing number of models and manufacturers  and the increasing number of dvd titles available for purchase and rent 
filmless digital cameras filmless digital cameras allow the capture of high resolution images  the viewing  editing and storage of such images on a computer system and their transmission over telephone lines and computer networks 
high quality copies of these images can be printed using color printers 
in addition  digital cameras can be connected directly to a pc for downloading of pictures and to a television for displaying pictures 
the original digital cameras were developed for the professional market and currently sell at prices of  to  as technology has advanced and manufacturing costs have decreased  digital cameras for the consumer market have been introduced in the to  price range 
compression technology has also enabled the development of digital video security cameras and low cost digital video cameras for use with pcs 
digital video recording systems digital video recording systems are aimed at replacing the analog vcr 
digital video recording systems will not only store home made movies and tv programs but will allow them to be easily edited 
in addition  digital video recording systems will enable high quality time shifting of tv program viewing by recording the program so that it can be watched simultaneously or on a delayed basis 
the recording media includes dvd recordable media and hard disks 
digital video recording systems use mpeg as the video compression format and dolby digital or mpeg audio as the audio format 
pc video systems historically  professional video editing systems were comprised of expensive pieces of analog audio and video equipment 
compression technology allows digital video images to be stored in a computer s memory in sufficient volume to enable capture and cut and paste editing to be performed through random access to stored images 
as the cost of compression technology has declined  a number of manufacturers have designed low cost digital video capture and editing systems that run on pcs  creating a new category of users in the corporate  education and government markets 
the availability of universal serial bus  or usb  connectors on most pcs currently being manufactured creates an opportunity for the development of low cost external video capture and editing accessories that can be easily installed by consumers 
we believe that enhanced support of video in consumer pcs  and the growing popularity of wideband internet services will open new opportunities for video capture and sharing applications on the pc and will increase the popularity of such products 
digital audio systems digital audio facilitates enhanced audio playback with features such as multi channel surround sound and virtual surround sound utilizing two channel technology 
many standards have emerged for the digital compression of audio 
current digital audio compression standards in use include dolby digital  dts  mlp and mp dolby digital and dts are competing standards of audio compression for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems in movie theaters and at home 
mlp was developed for audio compression in dvd audio 
mp is one of the compression standards recognized for the download of audio recordings over the internet 
our audio integrated circuits incorporate all of these standards 
the principal products using compressed digital audio in the consumer market are dvd players  pcs incorporating dvd roms  digital speakers and portable mp players 
other applications other existing and potential applications for our audio and video compression technologies include internet audio and video appliances  digital television and television set top boxes  as well as personal digital audio and video devices 
technology image and video technology the jpeg standard 
in  the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  committee of the international standards organization completed a technical specification for a standard to compress individual digitized images which may consist of still images or consecutive frames of video data 
jpeg has been widely adopted for video editing applications  since each frame in the video is individually compressed  allowing cutting and pasting of sequences as well as modification of individual frames 
images are compressed through elimination of spatial redundancies within an image and the filtering of high frequency areas to which the eye is less sensitive 
using these techniques  the jpeg compression standard is able to reduce the data necessary to represent an image without significant degradation of image quality 
still images or motion video can be compressed to varying degrees using jpeg  with greater compression resulting in lower quality 
typically  four to one or five to one compression yields broadcast image quality while to compression is similar to vhs quality 
zoran jpeg technology 
our jpeg technology incorporates a proprietary bit rate control algorithm that enables our jpeg based products to compress any image to a predetermined size while optimizing video quality using pre selected parameters 
without this feature  the jpeg compression process results in compressed data files of various sizes based on the actual content of the original image given a constant degree of compression 
an image with large amounts of visual detail will generate a larger data file than that generated from an image with less detail 
performance of many video applications is hampered by variability in the size of the compressed images in a video sequence  which can result in inefficient use of available memory  bus speed or communication channel capacity or even the loss of images 
our bit rate control is a standards plus solution that uses real time digital signal processing algorithms to optimize video quality based on pre selected parameters  which can be programmed by oems  without the loss of any image or video frame 
our bit rate control has been incorporated in our jpeg based devices that are used in video editing systems  filmless and tapeless digital cameras  color scanners  pc based security systems  video conferencing and other applications 
other features of our jpeg based products include their ability to handle a wide range of compression ratios  to perform a lossless compression algorithm in the same jpeg device  to rapidly scan or browse a large number of images and utilize advanced image processing algorithms that enable bit rate control of usb data  vertical blank interval detection  infrared remote control detection and scene analysis for computer control applications 
we implement these functions in a single integrated circuit while we believe most other manufacturers either offer fewer functions or require multiple chips  resulting in higher manufacturing costs and greater power consumption 
cmos sensor technology 
with the widespread availability of inexpensive complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  fabrication facilities  image sensor designers are now able to offer a single chip solution to perform the light to bytes function at a quality level that is competitive with the long established charge coupled device  or ccd  sensor technology  but with far greater operational flexibility and at much lower power consumption 
cmos sensors can scan in a variety of modes and directions and perform analog domain pre processing of the signal which may be advantageous from a system perspective 
although the greater pixel circuit complexity results in a larger imager today  progress is being made to both reduce the geometry of the pixel and use more aggressive design rules 
the result will be a sensor which provides both cost reduction and performance enhancement paths to the system designer over the traditional ccd based solution 
zoran cmos sensor technology 
the pixelcam zr and zr are high performance megapixel cmos image sensors that are ideal for digital still and video imaging products 
using our proprietary distributed pixel amplifier design  the pixel response is independent of its distance from each column s cds circuitry 
this unique architecture results in an extremely uniform pixel array with low fixed pattern noise without the need for off chip background frame subtraction circuitry 
the bank of analog front end circuits quantizes each pixel to bit resolution 
this highly parallel approach eases speed requirements on individual analog circuits and reduces overall power consumption 
separate programmable red  green and blue pga circuits enable analog domain color balance 
the flexibility of these sensors output image format permits the tradeoff between resolution and frame rate 
the image output may also be horizontally mirrored and vertically flipped 
the mpeg standards 
in  the moving pictures expert group  or mpeg  committee of the international standards organization completed a technical specification for a standard to compress moving audio and video into a single data stream 
like jpeg  mpeg removes spatial redundancies from single frames of video data 
mpeg improves on jpeg by also removing redundancies that occur between consecutive video frames 
because video represents movement  it is possible to detect and estimate the movement of similar picture elements between video frames  a process called motion estimation 
mpeg motion estimation uses the content of previous and future frames to predict the content of the current frame without using its full content 
mpeg implements audio compression by exploiting psycho acoustic masking  taking advantage of the fact that the ear is less sensitive to a quiet note at one frequency when a much louder note is present at a nearby frequency 
mpeg often achieves audio compression ratios of six to one and video compression ratios of over to mpeg is particularly suitable for low cost cd rom applications due to its low cost implementation 
in  the mpeg video committee completed a technical specification to address the more stringent requirements of the broadcast industry 
mpeg provides more sophisticated prediction techniques  enabling a compression solution to comprehend video as interlaced fields of data  rather than individual frames 
mpeg also allows for operation at higher resolution and at higher bit rates than mpeg  resulting in improved image quality for high motion  high detail video 
mpeg typically achieves compression ratios of to because of its higher bit rate  mpeg technology cannot be used in standard cd rom applications  but can be used in dvd players 
mpeg builds on the experience of the mpeg and mpeg standards  which are currently used in digital video applications 
mpeg is rich in features  and can be customized to serve the needs of specific industries while preserving a high level of interoperability across a variety of applications 
it allows a new level of interaction with visual content  providing the ability to view  access and manipulate objects rather than pixels 
mpeg s impact is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  mobile multimedia and game applications zoran mpeg technology 
beginning in  we established ourselves as a leading provider of mpeg technology for dvd and super video cd applications 
we introduced the first dvd decoder device integrating digital video with multi channel digital audio and programmable audio effects for use in dvd players 
we also introduced new mpeg compression chip cores that can be integrated into chips manufactured by oem customers  enabling these customers to reduce the cost of custom chip design and accelerate the time to market of their products 
audio technology the dolby digital standard 
in  dolby laboratories launched dolby digital  an audio compression technique which has emerged as an industry standard 
dolby digital was developed as a successor to dolby s pro logic analog technique for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 
it is currently used in movie theaters comprising over  screens worldwide and is also used in home theater and computer multimedia applications 
digital compression of audio data allows the storage of full quality multi channel audio playback in the limited space allocated for audio in video oriented formats 
it also facilitates the seamless integration of sound with compressed video 
the dolby digital audio compression standard is currently the principal audio compression technique used in dvd players 
dolby digital has also been adopted as a standard for use in high definition television and digital cable systems 
other audio standards 
other digital audio compression standards currently in use include dts  an audio compression standard that competes with dolby digital  mlp  a compression standard for dvd audio  and mp  used for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
zoran audio technology 
working closely with dolby laboratories  we have developed a programmable audio digital signal processing engine with an architecture optimized for dolby digital and other demanding audio applications and we were the first to develop a single chip solution for dolby digital decoding 
our vaddis dvd decoders and audio processors now incorporate this engine to allow systems manufacturers to replace system components with software modules  differentiate their products from their competition  use our silicon software library of advanced audio algorithms  and reduce system costs and time to market

in addition  we seek to design integrated circuits and cores  as well as copy ready reference designs which can reduce the time needed by manufacturers to integrate our products into their own products 
we have historically generated a significant percentage of our total revenues from development contracts with our strategic partners 
these development contracts provide that we will receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones and that we will retain ownership of the intellectual property developed 
development contracts have enabled us to fund portions of our product development efforts  to respond to the feature requirements of our customers  to accelerate the incorporation of our products into our customers products and to accelerate the time to market of our customers products 
we are currently developing new integrated circuits based on mpeg and dolby digital compression standards pursuant to a development contract with fujifilm  under which fujifilm is providing a portion of the development funding 
fujifilm has participated directly in product definition for these development programs and has the right to sell resulting products in japan under its distribution agreement with us 
fujifilm also has the right to manufacture a portion of our requirements for which it has contributed significant funding 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation 
these organizations fund up to of incurred project costs for approved projects up to contract maximums 
the agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of the total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
total grants earned in were  and in were  in we did not receive any grants from these organizations 
the terms of israeli government participation also contain restrictions on the location of research and development activities  and the terms of the grants from the chief scientist prohibit the transfer of technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the chief scientist 
we are currently engaged in the development of improvements to our camera on a chip  or coach  technology under grant from the chief scientist 
although we have received grants from the chief scientist and the foundation in the past  we intend to fund future research and development efforts for new products primarily from our own funds and through research and development arrangements with our major oem customers 
as of december   we had a staff of full time and part time research and development personnel  of whom are based in israel 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to focus on providing solutions  primarily compression related  for manufacturers seeking to design audio and video products for emerging high volume consumer applications 
in cooperation with leading manufacturers of audio and video equipment in the commercial and consumer markets  we attempt to identify market segments which have the potential for substantial growth 
to implement our strategy  we have established a direct sales force located at several sales and marketing offices  and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
we work closely in the product development process with strategic partners to incorporate our integrated circuits and software into their products 
potential products are designed to meet customer specific product requirements defined jointly by us and our strategic partners with our partners providing technological input  and in some cases  a portion of the development funding 
this strategy has permitted us to develop products with substantial financial and other assistance  while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the product once development is completed 
in addition  our application engineers assist customers in designing their products to incorporate our integrated circuits 
our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date 
we sell our products primarily through our person direct sales staff  of whom four are located in the united states and ten are located internationally 
our united states sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in north america  south america and asia  and our israeli sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in europe and the middle east 
in addition  we sell our products indirectly through commissioned sales representatives as well as selected distributors 
we typically warrant our products for a month period 
to date  we have not experienced material product returns or warranty expense 
we have opened offices in other parts of the world in order to better address specific markets 
during  we opened an office in shenzhen  china as part of our effort to capture a leadership position in the chinese digital audio and video markets 
during  we opened an office in taipei  taiwan in an effort to better address the digital camera market 
as of december   we had a staff of employees in our china office and employees in our taiwan office  including sales  applications and customer support employees 
in addition  in we opened offices in hong kong and korea 
at december  we had a staff of three in each location 
these offices also provide sales  applications and customer support 
we distribute our integrated circuit products in japan primarily under an agreement with fujifilm 
under this agreement  fujifilm acts as the primary distributor in japan of products developed by us under development contracts with fujifilm 
fujifilm also sells some of these products in japan under its own name 
we may sell these products directly in japan only to specified customers and must first buy the products from fujifilm 
fujifilm also has a nonexclusive license to distribute most of our products outside of japan 
we operate a representative office in tokyo to help promote our products in japan and to manage the sale of products not sold through fujifilm  such as integrated circuit cores and certain jpeg products 
we sell our dolby digital based products under a perpetual  non exclusive license from dolby to sell products that incorporate the dolby digital algorithm 
we are not required to pay license fees or royalties to dolby under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dolby  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dolby 
under our agreement with dolby  we may sell our dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for our dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our sales 
we sell our dts technology based products under a non exclusive license from dts technology llc to sell products that incorporate the dts algorithm 
we are not required to pay royalties to dts technology under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dts  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dts 
under our agreement with dts  we may sell our dts based products only to customers who are licensees of dts 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dts in the future could harm our sales 
backlog sales of our products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders 
however  sometimes we allow customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers requirements and manufacturing availability 
our business is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules 
as a result of these factors  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales 
manufacturing we contract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors  which enables us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
our engineers work closely with our foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and assure quality 
our primary foundry is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  which has manufactured integrated circuits for us since tsmc is currently manufacturing our dvd  audio  jpeg and some of our digital camera products 
in addition  fujifilm and national semiconductor manufacture some integrated circuit products for us 
fujifilm is currently manufacturing our jpeg codec  our jpeg based converter products and our mpeg decoder 
national semiconductor manufactures some of our digital camera products 
hyundai and fujitsu manufacture our usb multimedia controller chips 
our independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
all of our devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with micron to micron feature sizes 
all of our semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of five independent contractors  ase  amkor  asat  kyocera or vate  and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
our zr jpeg codec was developed jointly with fujifilm and is currently manufactured by fujifilm pursuant to an agreement that grants fujifilm the right to manufacture up to of our requirements for this product subject to fujifilm s ability to manufacture the product on substantially the same or better terms and conditions as we could obtain from a third party 
this agreement also grants fujifilm marketing rights in japan with respect to these products 
see sales and marketing 
we currently purchase products from all of our foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders 
our agreement with fujifilm entitles us to obtain wafer foundry services from fujifilm on most favored pricing and availability terms  subject to fujifilm s technological capabilities and reasonable limitations as to quality and delivery terms requested by us 
we do not currently have a long term supply contract with tsmc  and therefore tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
competition our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater resources in the areas of finance  manufacturing  technology  marketing  and distribution 
some of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
in the market for jpeg based products for desktop video editing applications  our principal competitors are divio and sunplus 
cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  fujitsu  motorola  stmicroelectronics and yamaha are currently shipping dolby digital based audio compression products 
c cube  now part of lsi logic  ess  luxsonor  matsushita  national semiconductor  stmicroelectronics  sony and winbond have introduced integrated audio and video devices for dvd and super video cd applications 
these manufacturers  as well as others  are licensed by dolby to incorporate dolby digital technology in their products 
in addition  some manufacturers  including sony  incorporate compression technologies other than dolby digital in audio products that compete with products using our integrated circuits 
in the markets for jpeg based products for use in filmless digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  atmel  omnivision  sunplus and texas instruments 
motorola is providing cmos sensor products 
in the market for mpeg based chip core products  our principal competitors are david sarnoff research center and sican microelectronics 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio and video compression technology depends on a number of factors  including price  quality  performance and features of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
the dvd market is growing  and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for integrated circuits used in dvd players 
we believe that several large japanese consumer electronics companies may be planning to enter this market and may attempt to develop mpeg hardware or software to compete with our products 
some of these potential competitors may develop captive implementations for use only with their own pc and commercial and consumer electronics products 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
historically  average unit selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the average unit selling prices of our products  we will likely need to reduce the cost of our products 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that lower the cost of manufacture  assembly and testing  by negotiating reduced charges by our foundries as and if volumes increase  and by successfully managing our manufacturing and subcontracting relationships 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships our business would be harmed 
proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information 
although we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of our intellectual property  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  distributors  customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information 
we currently hold several us patents  and have additional patent applications pending  that pertain to technologies and processes relating to our current business 
our intellectual property rights  if challenged  may not be upheld as valid  may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
in particular  the existence of several consortiums that license patents relating to the mpeg standard has created uncertainty with respect to the use and enforceability of patents implementing that standard 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
we sell our dolby digital based products under a perpetual non exclusive license from dolby which permits us to incorporate the dolby digital algorithm into our products 
our customers enter into license agreements with dolby pursuant to which they pay royalties directly to dolby 
under our agreement with dolby  we may sell our dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for our dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our business 
we sell our dts technology based products under a non exclusive license from dts technology llc to sell products that incorporate the dts algorithm 
we are not required to pay royalties to dts under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dts  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dts 
under our agreement with dts  we may sell our dts based products only to customers who are licensees of dts 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our sales 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we or our foundries from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we have been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past and we may be subject to additional claims in the future 
in particular  given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the mpeg standard  it is difficult for us to assess the possibility that our activities in the mpeg field may give rise to future patent infringement claims 
litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us we could incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by our foundries of certain processes 
employees as of december   we had full time and part time and contract employees  including full time and part time and contract employees primarily involved in research and development activities  in marketing and sales  in finance and administration and in manufacturing control and quality assurance 
we have full time employees and part time and contract employees based in israel  including employees who are primarily involved in engineering and research and development 
we have employees at our facilities in santa clara  california 
the remaining employees are located in our international offices in canada  japan  china  taiwan  hong kong and korea 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
item properties 
our executive offices  our principal administration  marketing and sales operations and a portion of our research and development operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in santa clara  california under a lease expiring in march our principal research and development and engineering facilities and the balance of our administration  marketing and sales operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in an industrial park in haifa  israel under a lease expiring in and approximately  square feet of leased space in kfar saba  israel under a lease expiring in the aggregate annual gross rent for our facilities was approximately  in we also lease sales offices in tokyo  japan  taipei  taiwan  and shenzhen  china 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  at the beginning of we opened offices in hong kong and korea 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that  should it be needed  suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations on commercially reasonable terms

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview from our inception in through  we derived the substantial majority of our revenue from digital filter processors and vector signal processors used principally in military  industrial and medical applications 
in  we repositioned our business to develop and market data compression products for the evolving multimedia markets and discontinued development of digital filter processor and vector signal processor products 
in  we discontinued production of these products 
our current lines of digital audio and video products include integrated circuits and related products used in digital versatile disc players  movie and home theater systems  filmless digital cameras and video editing systems 
we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to distributors and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
our cost of product sales consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of product sales to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
our product gross margin is also dependent on product mix and on the percentage of products sold directly to our oem customers versus indirectly through our marketing partners who purchase our products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses  maintain inventories and provide customer support and training 
lower gross margins on sales to distributors are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
product sales in japan are primarily made through fujifilm  our strategic partner and distributor in japan 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other distributors 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing further fluctuations in margins 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
in addition  we have historically generated a significant percentage of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers  although development revenue has declined as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we are also a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and require us to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  royalties  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
we conduct most of our research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in israel through our wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
as a result  some of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels 
to date  substantially all of our product sales and our development and licensing revenue have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in us dollars 
we expect that most of our sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
we have not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such fluctuations 
we may in the future elect to take action to reduce our foreign exchange risk 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce taxable income for us federal income tax purposes and by our israeli subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in in june  we sold to mgi software of canada the intellectual property related to our softdvd product line and transferred to mgi certain related software development and support resources in exchange for cash  mgi common stock and future royalties 
we do not currently expect  however  that these royalties will have a material impact on quarterly revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the shares of mgi stock received by us as part of this transaction are subject to future appreciation or depreciation 
our software revenues have declined significantly as a result of the sale of the softdvd product line 
in june  we acquired pixelcam  inc  a manufacturer of megapixel cmos image sensors  in exchange for  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   we acquired nogatech inc  a provider of chips that compress digital video images and establish connections  or video connectivity  between video devices and computers  as well as between video devices across a variety of networks  in exchange for  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we recognize development revenue using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized is that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs  based on current estimates of the costs to complete the project 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
at december  these investments totaled million 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we assess the value of this investment principally by using information acquired from the investee  including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this standard requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in the event actual results differ from these expectations then the resulting impact to income would be assessed in the period such determination was made

total revenues increased by to million in from million in product sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in product sales resulted primarily from increased unit sales of dvd products and to a lesser extent filmless digital cameras 
offsetting these increases somewhat were decreased unit sales for our digital audio and pc video products 
software  licensing and development revenues decreased by to million in from million in this decrease was due to a decline in the number and size of significant new licensing contracts  as well as the timing of revenue recognition on a long term development contract 
product gross margin 
product gross margin decreased to in compared to in the decrease was due to a substantial shift in product mix to a higher percentage of lower margin dvd products  which include cpu companion chips that are sold at low margin  and a shift in customer mix to a lower percentage of direct sales to oem customers 
in addition  we experienced a decline in the average selling price of our older vaddis iii dvd chip that is being phased out as we transition our customer base to our new vaddis iv plus dvd chip 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses increased by to million in from million in gross r d expenses increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech in june and october  respectively and the timing of major project expenses such as tape outs 
r d expenses in did not include reimbursements from the chief scientist 
for  chief scientist reimbursements were  r d expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in due to the increase in revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech  and the continued expansion of our presence in the asia pacific region including the establishment of offices in hong kong and korea at the beginning of amortization of goodwill and write off of acquired in process research and development 
the acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech resulted in the following charges pixelcam during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of pixelcam compared to million recorded during during  we did not record any charges related to the write off of in process research and development associated with the pixelcam acquisition 
for we incurred million in charges associated with the write off of in process research and development 
nogatech during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of nogatech compared to million recorded during during we did not record any charges related to the write off of in process research and development associated with the nogatech acquisition 
for we incurred million in charges associated with the write off of in process research and development 
the in process research and development project related to our pixelcam acquisition was completed and we began shipping the resulting product in the third quarter of the project associated with the acquisition of nogatech has been delayed due to uncertainty in the market concerning implementation timing of this technology 
completion of this project remains a significant risk to the company due to the remaining effort to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats from other companies 
failure to bring related products to market in a timely manner could adversely impact our future sales and profitability 
additionally  the value of the intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
we have not yet completed our assessment of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statements nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
upon adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas will be reclassified to goodwill 
companies are required to adopt sfas for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  our amortization of goodwill expense  which totaled million in  will be discontinued in in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company will be required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and has six months from january  to complete this task 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income increased by to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from increased interest income on higher cash balances following our acquisition of nogatech in october provision for income taxes

r d expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech  the continued expansion of our china office and the opening of our taiwan office 
amortization of goodwill and write off of acquired in process research and development 
the acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech resulted in the following charges pixelcam during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of pixelcam 
in addition to the amortization charge  during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the write off of acquired in process research and development associated with the pixelcam acquisition 
the allocation of million of the purchase price to the acquired in process research and development was determined by identifying the research project for which technological feasibility had not been established at the time of the acquisition and for which no alternative future uses then existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by pixelcam prior to the acquisition date compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to technological feasibility 
we estimated that  as of the acquisition date  the project was complete and the estimated costs to complete the project were approximately million 
nogatech during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisition of nogatech 
in addition to the amortization charge  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the write off of acquired in process research and development associated with the nogatech acquisition 
the allocation of million of the purchase price to the acquired in process research and development was determined by identifying the research project for which technological feasibility had not been established at the time of the acquisition and for which no alternative future uses then existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by nogatech prior to the acquisition date compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to technological feasibility 
we estimated that  as of the acquisition date  the project was complete and the estimated costs to complete the project were approximately million 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income increased by to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from increased interest income on higher cash balances following a follow on public offering of common stock in december provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development our estimated effective tax rate remained at for and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of working capital 
in addition  we had million of investments in other assets that have maturity dates that are beyond one year 
our operating activities provided cash of million during  primarily due to the net loss adjusted for the non cash impact of depreciation and the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech during in addition  an increase in accounts payable and decrease in inventory  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  also contributed to the cash provided by operating activities 
cash used in investing activities was million during cash used for short term investments during the year was million 
capital equipment expenditures accounted for million of the cash used while the purchase of long term investments used million cash provided by financing activities was million during and primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our incentive stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million  offset by the repurchase  shares of our common stock for million 
as of december  we are responsible for lease commitments of million associated with our worldwide facilities of which million is due in   is due in and  is due in and  respectively 
in addition  we had inventory purchase commitments of million at december  at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for consummation of any acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations  are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
selected pro forma financial data the following pro forma consolidated results of operations do no represent our results of operations or earnings per share information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
pro forma results of operations have been presented  in addition to the actual results  to provide period to period comparability of our underlying operating results excluding the following amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  the write off of acquired in process technology  and the amortization of deferred stock based compensation associated with the acquisition of nogatech  inc year ended december  in thousands  except per share data pro forma net revenues pro forma income loss from operations pro forma net income pro forma net income per share basic diluted future performance and risk factors the company s future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  the timing of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  seasonality in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the emergence of new industry standards  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  or a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders to purchase our products from independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
as a result of these factors  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock 
our success for the foreseeable future will be dependent on growth in demand for integrated circuits for dvd  filmless digital camera applications and  to a lesser extent  on digital audio and video editing applications and our ability to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate those types of integrated circuits into their products 
in and  we derived a majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and  to a lesser extent  super video cd applications 
we expect that sales of our products for dvd applications will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the near future 
our ability to sell our products for filmless digital camera applications and to a lesser extent digital audio and video editing applications will also have an impact on our financial performance for the foreseeable future 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes our sales to fluctuate 
because the markets our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in the customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the fourth calendar quarter represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday period  and therefore a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted more than one year 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm our sales and revenues if demand drops or our gross margins if average selling prices decline 
the development and evolution of markets for our integrated circuits is dependent on factors such as industry standards  over which we have no control  for example  if manufacturers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to the manufacturers and our sales would suffer 
the emergence of markets for our products is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
in particular  our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow these standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
also  competing standards may emerge that are preferred by manufacturers  which could also reduce our sales and require us to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if content compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our integrated circuits  and our sales to manufacturers would suffer 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
therefore  tsmc and these other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  reduced control over delivery schedules  reduced control over quality assurance  reduced control over manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world which are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of our products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
at present  all of our semiconductor products are assembled by one of five independent contractors ase  amkor  asat  kyocera  or vate 
our semiconductor products are tested by these contractors or other independent contractors 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered and will continue to consider various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers  and harm our business 
to be successful  we must efficiently develop new and enhanced products to meet rapidly changing customer requirements and industry standards 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and short product life cycles 
over the long run  we expect to increase our product development expenses  and our future success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that meet rapidly changing customer requirements and industry standards 
we may not successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  lack of market acceptance for such products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our sales and financial results 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
competition in the compression technology market has historically been dominated by large companies  such as stmicroelectronics  and companies that develop and use their own integrated circuits  such as sony 
as this market continues to develop  we face competition from other large semiconductor vendors  including atmel corporation  cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  ess technology  inc  fujitsu  lsi logic including c cube microsystems inc acquired during  motorola  omnivision technologies  inc  sunplus technology  and texas instruments 
we also face competition from internally developed solutions developed and used by major japanese original equipment manufacturers  who may also be our customers 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than ours in many areas  including finances  manufacturing  technology  marketing  and distribution 
many of our competitors have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same digital multimedia compression problems that our products address 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
the dvd market is growing  and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for dvd players and software 
some of these potential competitors may develop captive implementations for use only with their own pc and consumer electronics products 
it is also possible that application software vendors  such as microsoft  may attempt to enter the dvd application market in the future 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results would suffer 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these problems and may continue to experience them in the future and cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers account for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
in  sales to fujifilm accounted for of our total revenue 
our four largest customers in accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
during  our four largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenues with fujifilm accounting for 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
we are dependent on our relationship with fujifilm for a significant percentage of our product sales  and if this relationship were terminated  our business would be harmed 
fujifilm has been our largest customer in four of the last five years 
fujifilm purchases our products primarily as a distributor 
under our arrangement with fujifilm  fujifilm acts as the primary distributor in japan of products developed by us under development contracts with fujifilm 
fujifilm also sells some of these products in japan under its own name 
we may sell these products directly in japan only to specified customers and must first buy the products from fujifilm 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other distributors 
fujifilm also has a nonexclusive license to distribute most of our products outside of japan 
fujifilm has provided wafer manufacturing services on a most favored terms basis to us since and has also provided funding to support our development efforts 
if our relationship with fujifilm were terminated  our business would be harmed 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  of our total revenues were derived from international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a substantial majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
the majority of our research and development personnel and facilities and a significant portion of our sales personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
some of our officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and has recently been slowing 
this growth may continue to decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
during and the beginning of we also opened offices in taipei  taiwan  hong kong and seoul  korea 
our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or armed conflict 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of possible terrorist attacks on the united states and other regions of the world including locations where we maintain operations and by the potential expansion of armed conflict and potential instability associated with terrorism 
our operations could be harmed due to disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  reduced demand for consumer electronic products due to a potential extension of the global economic slowdown  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new us employees in such facilities  or potential expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from challenges by third parties 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we could become subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights 
we could become subject to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating losses  which totaled approximately million for federal tax reporting purposes as of december   against taxable income in future periods 
our net operating losses incurred prior to the consummation of our initial public offering in that we can use to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes are limited to approximately million per year 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could harm our financial condition 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of  complementary companies  products and technologies 
during  we acquired pixelcam and nogatech  and we may acquire additional businesses  products  or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur large write offs immediately or in the future 
our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products or technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could damage market acceptance of our products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
if we do not maintain our current development contracts or are unable to enter into new development contracts  our business could be harmed 
we historically have generated a significant percentage of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
under these contracts  we receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
if we fail to achieve the milestones specified in our existing development contracts  if our existing contracts are terminated or we are unable to secure future development contracts  our ability to cost effectively develop new products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we will not be able to expand our business as planned 
we may require substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund our ongoing research and development activities beyond our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including acceptance of and demand for our products  the types of arrangements that we may enter into with our independent foundries  and the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage our growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve our administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including the major portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations  are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business would be harmed 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
the loss of key management personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we may not be able to retain the services of any of our key employees 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  both in the united states and in israel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
the israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel in relation to the dollar  which will increase our costs as expressed in dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the new israeli shekel 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in israel 
the government programs we participate in and tax benefits we receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
in the year ended december   we did not receive proceeds from grants for research and development from the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
however  we did receive an aggregate of  in such grants during we plan to seek additional grants from the chief scientist in the future 
to be eligible for these grants  our development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if our development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  we will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase our research and development costs 
we also receive tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions as a result of the approved enterprise status of our existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must maintain our approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in our israeli subsidiary 
if we fail to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and we could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future  which would harm our business 
we have anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and there are provisions of delaware law that could prevent or delay a change in control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  quarterly variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the new israeli shekel would have an immaterial affect on our financial condition
