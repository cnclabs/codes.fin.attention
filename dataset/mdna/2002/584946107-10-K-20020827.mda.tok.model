subsequent events on july   mediware and fratelli auriana  entered into a second amendment to the loan agreement between the two parties 
the note between mediware information systems and fratelli auriana has been amended to extend the maturity date to september  in august  the company entered into two agreements with dr 
john gorman and his affiliates pertaining to the company s hcll product  which is in development 
dr 
gorman is a director of the company 
these agreements modify two earlier agreements that the company entered into with dr 
gorman and his affiliates prior to his joining the board 
in september  glace  inc glace  an affiliate of dr 
gorman  entered into a consulting agreement with the company to provide certain development services related to hcll  which was then known as hemocare the consulting agreement 
in september  dr 
gorman  on behalf of himself and a then to be formed entity  entered into a software agreement with the company under which dr 
gorman was granted the right to the hemocare software for uses outside of the healthcare field  in exchange for a payment of  the software agreement  and dr 
gorman and the company agreed to share certain legal costs associated with seeking pate nt protection for the hemocare software 
in the first of the august agreements  it was agreed that glace would accept a payment from the company of  as a final payment for all consulting fees due under the consulting agreement 
the company in turn waived any right to recover consulting fees previously paid by it under that agreement and confirmed its obligation to pay glace a milestone payment of  upon the grant by the fda of k approval for hcll 
the company will pay glace an advance of  on this milestone  which is subject to repayment by glace in four equal annual installments of  each if k approval for hcll is not granted by december  the company also agreed to pay  towards patent costs on an additional provisional patent for the hcll technology  with the understanding that the company has no obligation to pay for any further patent work on hcll undertaken by dr

gorman  glace or deep sky to the company  and any other aspect of their business relationship 
factors that may affect future results fluctuations in quarterly operating results mediware s revenues and results of operations can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
system sales revenues in any quarter depend substantially upon mediware s sales performance and customer s budgeting and buying practices 
system sales in any quarter may fluctuate due to contract activity  demand for the company s products and services  lengthy and complex sales cycles  and the customer s internal budgets for new technology systems and technical resources to deploy them 
additionally  the terms of a final contract may materially affect the company s ability to recognize anticipated quarterly revenues 
factors include  but are not limited to  the following systems contracts may include both currently deliverable and non deliverable software products 
customer needs for services that include significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance 
customer specific acceptance criteria 
payment terms that are long term or depend upon contingencies 
reliance on third party software mediware licenses various third party software products that it incorporates into its own software products 
these products may include operating systems  relational database management systems  knowledge clinical databases and other key systems 
the termination by any third party vendor of mediware s licenses to use these products  or a significant change to a relied upon product  could have a material adverse effect on mediware s operations 
changes that could have a material adverse effect include  for example  the third party products becoming inoperable  features and functions becoming unavailable  product performance being materially reduced  or unfavorable pricing changes 
although alternate software products are available  mediware could incur substantial costs if it is required to adapt its products to alternative third party software products 
dependence on third party marketing relationships mediware s continued growth depends on its ability to build and maintain strong marketing partnerships 
the company believes its marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by these relationships 
mediware has marketing partnerships with certain other software vendors who are also competitors of mediware 
for example  mediware partners with shared medical systems sms which was acquired by siemens  and mckesson hboc in the area of blood bank products 
however  both shared medical systems and mckesson hboc offer competing pharmacy and operating room products  either directly or through other partners 
in the event that marketing relationships are discontinued  the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by various governmental and regulatory bodies 
the decisions made and initiatives promulgated by these organizations may significantly influence operations of hospitals and healthcare organizations 
their influence affects purchasing and investment decisions by hospitals which could impact negotiations with the company 
many hospitals are consolidating and forming or becoming part of integrated healthcare delivery networks ihdns 
the formation of ihdns might reduce the number of discrete prospects the company may target and could provide more negotiating leverage to the company s prospective customers 
these events  if they occurred  could result in a reduction of selling prices  an increase in the length of the sales cycle  or other situations that could negatively affect the company 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is extremely competitive 
some of the company s competitors are sms  mckesson hboc  cerner corporation and sunquest recently acquired by misys plc  each of which offer products that compete with certain offerings of the company 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  sales and marketing resources 
a number of factors determine success or failure in this market  including the functionality of the software  the quality of client references  the underlying technical architecture  the financial stability of the software provider  the ongoing support of the system  and the quality and quantity of the sales organization 
the company s ability to maintain a positive stance in all of the above areas will affect its ability to compete successfully 
managing growth mediware s ability to manage future growth is partly dependent on the ability to recruit  train and retain employees that possess industry specific expertise 
the company has experienced significant growth in service related revenues  customer base and product development activity 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development in all divisions 
mediware s success will partially depend upon its ability to recruit  manage and maintain appropriate staffing levels of technical and industry expertise to meet customer needs and service new sales 
the market for such personnel is highly competitive  making it difficult to adjust staffing timely in reaction to fluctuations in sales activity 
government regulation the hospitals that comprise the primary market for the company s products must comply with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations 
the adequacy of blood bank information management and record keeping products are subject to regulation  inspection and review by the us food and drug administration the fda 
the company s blood bank products are subject to regulation by the fda as medical devices 
the fda has developed new design control regulations  effective in june  as part of its quality system regulations adopted in october of that apply to blood bank information systems and to the inspection of vendors of such systems 
although mediware has updated its internal quality system to comply with new guidelines adopted under these regulations  it cannot predict whether it will be fully in compliance with these guidelines or any future guidelines  regulations or inspection procedures 
non compliance with any such guidelines  regulations or procedures could have a material adverse effect on the operations of clinical information system vendors of blood bank information systems  including mediware 
the fda modernization act of was enacted on november  and became effective on february  under this legislation  the fda is directed to consider the extent to which reliance on post market controls could expedite the pre market notification review process and the classification of devices 
the legislation also requires fda to ensure that good manufacturing practices conform  to the extent practicable  to internationally recognized standards for medical devices 
neither of these provisions appear on its face to contemplate regulation which would have a material adverse effect on the company s blood bank information system operations  however  the legislation expanded the jurisdiction of the fda and the company is unable to predict the effect of any resulting applicable future regulation 
if any of the company s other products become subject to congressional or governmental agency efforts to establish or expand governmental agency jurisdiction  compliance would likely be costly and tim e consuming 
in september and october  three product design anomalies were discovered in the hemocare donor module  which at the time was utilized by clients 
although clients have reported no adverse events  the company notified and gave procedural work arounds to the clients  and corrected the problems in hemocare revision b  which was distributed in september in addition  these three product malfunctions were reportable to the fda under the medical device reporting regulation cfr which was mandated by the safe medical devices act of mediware has submitted these reports mdrs to the fda as required 
during the period of january through april  two additional mdrs were filed for product design issues involving the optional electronic crossmatch function 
additionally  three non clinical yk issues were discovered after the start of fiscal year the company instituted an extensive and comprehensive retrospective design and validation review of hemocare s safety critical functionality with the assistance of an external blood bank software consultant 
this effort was reported to fda in february   and a progress report of the findings was issued to fda on april  the report outlined issues that were identified during the review that require corrective action as well as a plan to achieve those corrections 
an inspection performed in august verified that all corrective actions have been taken to the satisfaction of the fda 
on april   the fda  under the new quality system inspection technique qsit initiative  inspected the hemocare product center 
the inspection concluded on may   with several observations 
the company responded to the observations on may   reporting the implementation of corrective and preventive actions 
fda responded by letter on june   that no regulatory action was indicated 
periodic updates on the progress of the corrective and preventive actions have been and continue to be sent to fda 
there can be no assurance that the company s actions taken in response to reportable events  corrective or preventive measures  will be deemed adequate by the fda or that the company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with regulatory requirements 
between may and august  all three blood bank division registered facilities were inspected by the fda 
the inspection of the dallas facility revealed two minor procedural issues 
these issues were immediately addressed and resolved with the fda 
the other two facilities received no notices of defect in their inspections 
on june   a customer notification was distributed to hemocare customers notifying them of the potential for an antigen typing error to occur under certain conditions involving the unit antigen test entry of the hemocare blood bank data management system ver 
b b 
this notification provided a procedural work around until a software patch is released in october  this customer notification was reported to the fda under the mdr regulations  as required 
additional product clearance was received from the fda on june  to market the latest version of the lifetrak lab to blood centers 
as part of mediware s lifetrak system  the main functions of lifetrak lab were initially cleared for marketing in the most recent fda clearance allows for increased functionality 
the company cannot guarantee that future fda submissions will be cleared on a timely basis 
the company has dedicated substantial time and resources in its attempts to comply with applicable guidelines and regulations and believes that it is in substantial compliance therewith 
the fda enforces compliance by such actions as recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and criminal prosecutions 
unsatisfactory compliance and the inability to remedy timely any non compliance  resulting in any of the above actions  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new regulations relating to patient confidentiality hipaa contains provisions regarding the confidentiality and security of patient medical record information 
standards for the electronic handling of health data and security of patient information became effective in this legislation requires the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  to a adopt national standards for electronic health information transactions  b adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information  and c establish a schedule for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations 
the standards and legislation will impact the customers ability to obtain  use or disseminate patient information  which will extend to their use of the company s products 
the company believes that the proposed standards issued to date would not materially affect the business of the company 
the company cannot determine the potential impact of the standards that might finally be adopted 
product related liabilities all of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in patient care settings 
mediware s license agreements contain provisions to limit exposure to product related claims 
these provisions  however  may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
the company maintains product liability insurance at an amount it believes adequate for its intended purpose  however  there can be no assurances that the insurance will cover a claim brought against the company 
although no claims have been brought against the company to date for injuries related to the use of its products  there is a risk that such claims could be pursued 
a successful claim brought against the company  not covered by insurance or greater than the insured limits  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
system errors and warranties despite testing by mediware  software products as complex as those offered by the company and used in a wide range of clinical and health information systems settings are likely to contain a number of errors or bugs  especially early in their product life cycle 
the company s products are clinical information systems used in patient care settings where a low tolerance for bugs exists 
testing of products is difficult due to wide range of environments the systems are installed in 
due to these factors  there is no assurance that the discovery of defects or errors will not cause delay in product delivery  poor client references  payment disputes  contract cancellations  or additional expenses and payments to rectify problems 
any of these factors may delay acceptance of products  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights  proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license and marketing agreements  and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary information 
the company has not historically filed patent applications or copyrights covering its software technology 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against the misappropriation of its intellectual property 
the company does not believe its software products  third party software products the company offers under sublicense agreements  company trademarks or other company proprietary rights infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation
