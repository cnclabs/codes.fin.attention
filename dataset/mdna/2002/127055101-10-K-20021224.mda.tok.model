item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation i 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its policies and estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company primarily derives its revenue from the sale of chemical products  performance materials and specialty fluids products 
other operating revenues include tolling  services and royalties received for licensed technology 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which establishes the criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the company generally is able to ensure that products meet customer specification prior to shipment 
the company prepares its estimates for sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual future results vary  the company may need to adjust its estimates  which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could affect future earnings 
as of september   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process  and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
inventory valued under the lifo method comprised of total inventory at september  had the company used the first in  first out fifo method instead of 
table of contents the lifo method for such inventories the value of those inventories would have been million higher as of september  the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is stated at market value 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such write downs have not historically been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the fair value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  is based on undiscounted estimated cash flows at the lowest level determinable 
the company s estimates reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
cabot may decide to abandon a fixed asset project  plant expansion or other long lived asset initiative in which case an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its salvage value 
an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which cabot commits to a plan to abandon the asset 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
the fair value of the assets including goodwill balances is based on discounted estimated cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s best estimates of future growth rates  capital expenditures  discount rates  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill is recorded 
cabot performed the fiscal impairment test and determined that no impairment loss should be recognized 
environmental costs the company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single liability amount cannot be reasonably estimated  but a range can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues the amount that reflects its best estimate within that range or the low end of the range if no estimate within the range is better 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
the availability of new information  changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in applicable government laws and regulations could result in higher or lower costs 
the company does not reduce its estimated liability for possible recoveries from insurance carriers 
proceeds from insurance carriers are recorded when realized by the receipt of cash or a contractual agreement 
as of september   the company had million reserved for environmental matters 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its employees 
in addition  the company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions  including interest rates  expected return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increases for 
table of contents employees 
projected health care benefits reflect the company s assumptions about health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
at september   cabot has recorded million for its pension obligation and million for its postretirement benefit obligations 
litigation and contingencies the company accrues a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on the company s best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if the company is unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
ii 
results of operation cabot corporation and its subsidiaries the company or cabot are organized into three reportable segments chemical businesses  cabot performance materials cpm  and cabot specialty fluids csf 
the chemical businesses are primarily comprised of carbon black  fumed metal oxides  inkjet colorants  and aerogels

in total  however  pricing declines exceeded raw material cost reductions by almost million 
as a result of contract disagreements with certain tantalum customers  cpm experienced lower volumes in cpm was also negatively impacted by reduced volumes and profits at cabot supermetals csm  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of cabot in february  these negative impacts were offset by improved contract related pricing and reduced tantalum ore costs 
csf continued to

these initiatives included the realization of approximately million in cost reductions  the initial public offering ipo and subsequent spin off of cabot microelectronics and the sale of the lng business for million 
cabot s sales for  and were  million   million and  million  respectively 
in  decreased pricing for the carbon black business and decreased volumes for cpm contributed to a million decline in sales 
in  improved pricing and increased volumes in cpm offset lower volumes and negative currency exchange effects in the chemical businesses resulting in a million improvement in sales over percentage of total sales segment sales chemical businesses performance materials specialty fluids sales by geographic region north america europe south america asia pacific continuing operations chemical businesses carbon black  fumed metal oxides  inkjet colorants  and aerogels segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions sales for the chemical businesses were  million in  compared with  million in and  million in in  sales decreased  primarily as a result of reduced pricing on flat year over year volumes 
pbt decreased  from million in to million in  primarily as a result of reduced pricing of almost million which was partly offset by million of lower raw material costs 
in addition  higher operating costs were offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts 
in  sales decreased  primarily as a result of lower volumes 
pbt decreased  from million in to million in  largely as the result of lower volumes million  a strong us dollar million and higher administrative and business development costs million offset partly by approximately million of higher margins 

table of contents carbon black sales  which comprise the majority of the sales in the chemical businesses segment  were down from due to decreased pricing 
globally  carbon black sales volumes were flat year over year 
volumes increased slightly in north and south america but declined in europe due to weak economic conditions and pressure from imports 
strengthened demand in asia pacific  particularly in china  resulted in an improvement in volumes for the region 
carbon black pbt decreased by compared to due primarily to price decreases of approximately  which in dollar terms were in excess of raw material cost declines of approximately  and to a lesser degree  increases in operating expenses 
these were partly offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts 
in  the fumed metal oxides business experienced a steady recovery in all of its markets traditional silicone rubber  composites  adhesives  and electronics with overall sales and volumes up and  respectively 
improved pricing and lower feedstock and administrative costs  partially offset by unfavorable product mix  contributed to a improvement in the profitability of the fumed metal oxides business 
the inkjet colorants business continues to gain market acceptance  with both sales and volumes growing in and  respectively due to higher market penetration 
sales increased to both oem and after market customers  and incorporated both black and color pigments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  cabot s aerogels business entered the start up phase of its newly constructed semi works facility in frankfurt  germany 
the first commercial product shipments occurred in the first quarter of fiscal outlook for the chemical businesses have shown signs of recovery with improved year over year volumes in the second half of fiscal  with volumes higher than the comparable period of the chemical businesses experienced improved demand in the fourth fiscal quarter though it is typically a soft quarter due to vacations and plant shutdowns 
despite these positive indications  given the uncertainty in the automotive  electronic  and construction end use markets  the company remains cautious concerning the short term outlook for the chemical businesses 
high oil prices  volatility in the financial markets  and the political situation in the middle east and south america further add to that uncertainty 
carbon black has experienced erosion in margins over the past several years as the economic climate has softened 
it is unclear whether this trend will reverse as the economy recovers 
in addition  by july  the chemical businesses will incur additional expenses of approximately million for capital improvements of the company s carbon black facilities located in the united states that will be required in order to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants as required by the usepa s final rule amending the generic maximum achievable control technology standards 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of these issues  the chemical businesses will continue to search for operating efficiencies and will focus on cost savings initiatives 
performance materials segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions cpm sales were million in  compared with million in and million in results of operations for the cpm business were adversely impacted in fiscal by disputes relating to tantalum supply contracts the company entered into in with two customers 
as a result of these disputes  one customer failed to purchase any tantalum in accordance with the terms of its contracts with the company until late in the third quarter of fiscal  and one customer did not purchase any tantalum in accordance with the terms of its contract during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
each of these disputes has been resolved and claims relating to the disputes that were the subject of litigation have been settled 
in connection with the resolution of the dispute between the company and vishay intertechnology inc 
table of contents vishay  vishay extended by one year the term of one of its contracts with the company and agreed to purchase tantalum products at regular intervals throughout the terms of both of its contracts beginning late in the third quarter of fiscal  in exchange for volume and price concessions 
in connection with the resolution of the dispute between the company and kemet electronics corporation kemet  kemet extended through the term of its contract 
the extended contract calls for reduced prices and higher volumes and relates to both tantalum powder and tantalum wire products 
in addition  the company has the option to sell additional product to kemet on certain conditions throughout the contract term 
a third customer  avx corporation avx  has commenced legal action against the company in connection with its tantalum supply agreement with the company 
avx  however  has continued to purchase product in accordance with the terms of its contract 
as a result of these tantalum supply contract disagreements  volumes declined in fiscal compared to fiscal cpm was also negatively impacted by reduced volumes and profits at csm  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of cabot in february  however  lower average ore costs and higher contract prices offset the impact of the volume declines in both cpm and csm  resulting in a million increase in pbt 
the increase in pbt in versus was the result of a volume increase in fiscal and higher average selling prices  somewhat offset by higher ore costs 
outlook for the short term outlook for cpm remains uncertain due to the depressed state of the electronics industry 
tantalum supply contracts together with the purchase in of the remaining stake in cabot supermetals position cabot to benefit from a long term turnaround in the electronics sector 
specialty fluids segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions specialty fluids sales in were million versus million in and million in slightly higher sales results were primarily driven by improved pricing in cesium formate  which increased by approximately during the year  offset by reduced pricing levels for tantalum and lower volumes in spodumene 
cesium formate volumes remained steady with a increase in increased net revenue per barrel resulted in million in pbt for fiscal  making it the first profitable year for csf 
since csf s formation  cesium formate has been successfully used in oil and gas well completions and seven drill in applications 
the million increase in sales in versus was the result of increased volumes 
outlook for the political situation in the middle east  proposed new taxes on oil and gas profits in the uk north sea  and the pace of recovery in world economies have resulted in a cautious near term outlook for csf 
the company continues to be encouraged by the fluid s performance in drill in and completion applications

also during the fourth quarter  the company had an effective tax rate of which reduced the overall effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to  down from in fiscal the reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to an increased benefit associated with the favorable settlement of a customer dispute that resulted in additional export sales  lower earnings  and the fact that actual tax return liabilities were lower than expected 
the reduction in the company s overall effective tax rate resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
despite these adjustments which impacted the operating results for the fiscal year  the company believes that the earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations before special items reasonably reflect the operating performance of the businesses during fiscal gross profit declined by million in due to a decrease in margins in the chemical businesses and lower volume in cpm 
these declines were partially offset by improved pricing and lower raw material costs in cpm and  to a lesser degree  positive foreign exchange translations in the chemical businesses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk cabot s principal risk management objective is to identify and monitor its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices and cabot s share price  in order to assess the impact that changes in each could have on future cash flow and earnings 
cabot manages these risks through normal operating and financial activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
gains or losses associated with financial instruments are generally offset by the changes in value of the underlying transactions 
market risk exposure to other financial instruments is not material to earnings  cash flow  or fair values 
cabot s risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all instruments entered into by cabot are reviewed and approved by cabot s risk management committee  which is charged with enforcing cabot s risk management policy 
cabot has formally documented the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives 
all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
hedge accounting is followed for derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair value and cash flow hedges 
for derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges  the changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives  along with changes in the fair value of the hedged liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risks  are recorded in current period earnings 
for derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income  and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings 
by using derivative instruments  cabot is subject to credit and market risk 
if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  cabot s credit risk will equal the fair value gain on the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a repayment risk for cabot 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  cabot owes the counterparty and  therefore  assumes no repayment risk 
cabot minimizes the credit or repayment risk

interest rates cabot s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and variable rate debt and to match borrowing costs with the economics of cabot s business cycles 
cabot may use interest rate swaps to adjust fixed and variable rate debt positions 
in october  cabot entered into four fixed to variable interest rate swaps in an aggregate notional amount of million of its us dollar denominated debt 
the swaps are derivative instruments as defined by fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and have been designated as fair value hedges 
the swaps hedge the change in the fair value of million of cabot s fixed rate medium term notes due to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps and the medium term notes they hedge mature on various dates through february the fair values of the derivative instruments are recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
a corresponding increase to long term debt of million was recorded for the change in the fair value of the debt at september  the interest rate swaps were determined to be highly effective and no amount of ineffectiveness needed to be recorded in earnings during the period ended september  the variable interest rates on the swaps reset every six months in june and december 
as part of the csm acquisition  cabot assumed interest rate swaps related to the variable rate debt 
the swaps economically hedged the risk of change in market interest rates associated with the variable interest on the debt 
the swaps are derivative instruments as defined by fas no 
the interest rate swaps were recorded as other liabilities at their fair value of million on the acquisition date 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments were immaterial 
in october  cabot refinanced the underlying variable rate debt and the swaps were terminated 
on october   cabot entered into two new interest rate swaps related to the october debt agreement with an aggregate notional amount of billion yen million 
the swaps are variable for fixed swaps of the quarterly interest payments  mature in fiscal year  and lock in a fixed yen interest rate of 
the swaps are derivative instruments as defined by fas no 
and have been designated as cash flow hedges 
cabot has the equivalent of million of euro debt and million of yen denominated debt at variable rates 
a change in rates of on cabot s aggregate variable rate debt could cause interest expense to change by million per year 
cabot did not enter into financial instruments to hedge interest rates during or cabot settled its remaining interest rate swaps in january for  the gains or losses in interest income or expense associated with interest rate swaps were immaterial 
as of september   cabot had million in cash and short term investments 
it is the company s practice to invest excess cash in instruments that will earn a high rate of return consistent with the protection of principal 
interest income earned may vary as a result of changes in interest rates and average cash balances  which could fluctuate over time 
foreign currency cabot s international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
operations in each country are closely monitored so cabot can respond to changing economic and political environments and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
specifically  during the year ended september   economic and political instability in argentina and brazil has led to larger than expected fluctuations in the exchange rates of those countries 
the argentina peso was devalued by more than after the government was forced to abandon its fixed exchange rate policy that pegged the value of the peso to the us dollar 
the brazilian real has recently weakened to record lows due to concerns related to the possible impact that the october presidential election could have on the economy 
the current depressed state of these functional currencies has resulted in a devaluation of the translated income statements for the 
table of contents year ended september  however  this was partly offset by the benefit of a net us dollar receivable position in these entities 
accordingly  cabot utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than its foreign entities functional currencies 
in  and  none of cabot s forward contracts were designated as hedging instruments under fas no 
cabot monitors its foreign exchange exposures and adjusts its hedge position accordingly 
cabot s forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  and czech republic koruna 
the company s treasury function  under the guidance of the company s risk management committee  continuously monitors foreign exchange exposures so that cabot can respond to changing economic and political environments and attempt to minimize the impact of adverse currency movements 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  on october   cabot entered into a billion yen million three year variable rate term loan agreement with a group of banks to refinance existing debt at csm 
this loan has been designated as a foreign currency hedge of cabot s net investments in japanese yen denominated subsidiaries and gains or losses for the effective portion of the hedge will be recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss line in stockholders equity 
also subsequent to the fiscal year end  on november   cabot entered into two cross currency swaps for an aggregate amount of million 
upon maturity of the agreement which is scheduled to be october   cabot is entitled to receive million and is obligated to pay billion japanese yen 
cabot is also entitled to receive semi annual interest payments on million at month us dollar libor interest rates and is obligated to make semi annual interest payments on billion japanese yen at month japanese yen libor interest rates 
this swap has been designated as a foreign currency hedge of cabot s net investment in japanese yen denominated subsidiaries and gains or losses for the effective portion of the hedge will be recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss line in stockholders equity 
political risk in addition to foreign currency exposure  cabot is also exposed to political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
these risks may include actions of governments especially those newly appointed  importing and exporting issues  contract loss  and asset abandonment 
the company actively monitors these risks to reduce any potential adverse effects 
share repurchases cabot repurchases its shares in order to offset dilution caused by issuing shares under its various employee stock plans 
in addition  cabot may repurchase its shares as a preferred method of returning excess cash to shareholders 
from time to time  cabot enters into derivative instruments in its stock in order to fix the price of stock for delivery at a future date 
these agreements provide cabot with the right to settle forward contracts in cash or an equivalent value of cabot corporation common stock 
in cabot purchased  shares of its common stock under share repurchase contracts  at an average price of per share 
there were no open share repurchase contracts at september  and no share repurchase contracts were executed in fiscal commodities cabot is exposed to price fluctuations in certain commodities  such as feedstock and natural gas 
when it owned the lng segment  from time to time  cabot entered into commodity futures contracts  commodity price swaps  and or option contracts to hedge a portion of firmly committed and anticipated transactions against natural gas price fluctuations 
cabot monitored its exposure to ensure the overall effectiveness of its hedge positions 
in  cabot realized a million loss on lng futures contracts 
in fiscal and  no futures contracts were entered into by cabot 

table of contents value at risk cabot utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange  share repurchases and commodity sensitive derivative financial instruments within a confidence interval 
cabot s computation is based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  share repurchases and commodities 
these interrelationships are determined by observing historical interest rates  foreign currency  share price and commodity market changes over corresponding periods 
the assets and liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions  which are hedged by derivative financial instruments  are excluded from the model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
cabot s computations are based on a monte carlo simulation method 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by cabot 
the var model estimated a maximum loss in market value of million for the twelve month period following september  for derivative instruments held as of that date 
at no time during or did actual changes in market value exceed the var amounts during the reporting period 
in  the var model estimated a maximum loss in market value of million from october  through november  for derivative instruments held as of september
