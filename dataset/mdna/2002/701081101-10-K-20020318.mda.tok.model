item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations outlook and overview the year was marked by an overall improvement in rig activity and cash flow for the company 
net income improved to million as compared to net losses before extraordinary gain of million and million the previous two years 
rig utilization  dayrates and rental activity improved substantially in the company s gulf of mexico drilling markets  continuing a trend that started in mid the main driver of this trend was the increase in spending by oil and gas operators in response to significantly higher demand and prices for natural gas in the united states 
the company s international markets began to improve late in experiencing significantly higher utilization in the fourth quarter  most notably in the asia pacific region and kazakhstan 
after reaching the highest levels of dayrates and utilization since fall of  the gulf of mexico market began to soften at the end of the third quarter of due primarily to a reduction in drilling activity by operators in response to declining demand and prices for natural gas  due in part to the economic recession in the united states 
during the fourth quarter  dayrates for the company s seven jackup rigs dropped approximately percent while utilization decreased from percent for the first three quarters to percent for the fourth quarter 
during the same period  some softness was experienced in the company s gulf of mexico rental tool operations and barge rig business  but to a much lesser extent than the jackup rigs due to the consolidated nature of the barge rig market 
management anticipates that the reduced demand for drilling services in the gulf of mexico market will continue through the first half of  which will result in reduced revenues from our barge  jackup and rental tools operations as compared to management anticipates that revenues from the company s international land rig operations will increase over  due to increased rig utilization in our markets  particularly latin america and the asia pacific region 
international barge revenues for are anticipated to approximate in the company s fourth quarter conference call with investors  management stated that the level of revenues and cash flow that the company will generate in will depend to a large extent on the pace of recovery in drilling activity and dayrates in the gulf of mexico market 
management anticipates that drilling activity will increase in the second half of if there is a sustained recovery in the us economy  which would reduce current high inventories and lead to an increase in demand for natural gas 
one scenario posed by management to investors is for a fairly rapid pickup in rig utilization and rental tool activity  in which case revenues for the year could reach million 
this compares with revenues for the year of million 
on the other hand  if the recovery in the us economy lags and the demand for natural gas is not as strong  then the recovery in the gulf of mexico market could lag until the third quarter 
in this case management anticipates revenues could be approximately million 
during september  the company relocated its corporate office to houston 
the reorganization included the consolidation of its corporate and international drilling activities from tulsa  oklahoma  with its us offshore drilling operations already domiciled in houston 
the reorganization of certain senior management positions and management of drilling operations accompanied the relocation

dayrates increased percent and percent for the barge rigs and jackup rigs  respectively  as compared to the previous year 
the increase in dayrates was partially offset by decreased utilization from percent in to percent in for the jackup rigs 
the decrease in utilization was due primarily to the slowdown in the gulf of mexico jackup market during the fourth quarter of jackup utilization during the fourth quarter was percent as compared to approximately percent during the first three quarters of us land drilling revenues decreased million due to the sale of the company s last remaining us land rig  rig  in november international drilling revenues increased million to million in the current period as compared to the year ended december  international land drilling revenues increased million to million during revenues in the former soviet union region  which includes kazakhstan and russia  increased million to million during as compared to the previous year

other matters business risks internationally  the company specializes in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  the company primarily drills offshore in the gulf of mexico with barge  jackup and platform rigs for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company  except for the gulf of mexico  where drilling contracts are generally for a shorter term  and oil and gas companies tend to respond more quickly to upward or downward changes in prices 
most international contracts are of longer duration and oil and gas companies have committed to longer term projects to develop reserves and thus short term fluctuations in price do not tend to affect our operations 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities  which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on us operations 
due to the locations in which the company drills  the company s operations are subject to interruption  prolonged suspension and possible expropriation due to political instability and local community unrest 
further  the company is exposed to liability issues from pollution arising out of its operations 
the majority of such risks are transferred to the operator by contract or otherwise insured 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to impairment of property  plant and equipment  impairment of goodwill and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other matters continued impairment of property  plant and equipment 
management periodically evaluates the company s property  plant and equipment to determine that their net carrying value is not in excess of their net realizable value 
these evaluations are performed when the company has realized sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and recovery is not contemplated in the near future 
management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to their fair value if it is below its net carrying value 
impairment of goodwill 
management periodically assesses whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired is impaired based on the ability of the operation  to which it relates  to generate cash flows in amounts adequate to recover the carrying value of such assets at the measurement date 
if an impairment is determined  the amount of such impairment is calculated based on the estimated fair market value of the related assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  the company will cease to amortize million of goodwill 
the company has recorded million of goodwill amortization in and would have recorded million of goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company expects to complete the initial review during the second quarter of the company is currently reviewing its operations to identify appropriate reporting units  including identification of the related operating assets  goodwill  and liabilities 
subsequent to the above identification the company will estimate the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  deduct the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and compare the residual to the recorded goodwill attributable to the reporting unit 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  the company must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in december the company began to utilize hedging strategies to manage fixed rate interest exposure by entering into one swap agreement 
in january  the company entered into two additional swap agreements 
the terms of the swap agreements are as follows months notional amount fixed rate floating rate dollars in thousands december november  three month libor plus basis points january november  three month libor plus basis points january november  three month libor plus basis points if the floating rate is less than the fixed rate  the counter party will pay the company accordingly 
if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate  the company will pay the counter party 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december   was not material 
the change in the fair value of the swap agreement will be offset by the change in the fair value of the related debt
