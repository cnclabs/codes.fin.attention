table of contents looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview we develop products and procedures to improve people s eyesight using lasers 
our principal product  the visx star excimer laser system tm visx system  is designed to correct the shape of a person s eyes to reduce or eliminate the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses 
the food and drug administration fda has approved the visx system for use in the treatment of most types of refractive vision disorders including nearsightedness  farsightedness  and astigmatism 
the fda has also approved our wavescan tm wavefront system wavescan system  which provides a complete refractive analysis of the eye s entire optical system 
in the future  we anticipate that doctors will be able to use this analysis to enhance treatments with the visx system 
we sell visionkey cards to control the use of the visx system and to collect license fees for the use of our patents 
the laser vision correction industry is evolving rapidly 
economic  market  and technology changes frequently affect visx and could harm our business in the future 
please see the section of this report entitled risk factors  which begins on page  for a more thorough description of the risks that our business faces 
if any of the risks in the risk factors section described below materialize  orders and revenues for visx systems and visionkey cards could fluctuate or decline 
accordingly  our past results may not be useful in predicting our future results 
results of operations compared to year ended december  change s revenue system sales percent of revenue license  service and other revenue percent of revenue total system sales revenue in was million lower than in due to a decline in sales of laser systems  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from upgrades of laser systems and the introduction of our new wavescan system in laser system sales revenue declined million due to a number of factors the recession both us and worldwide  increased competition  and delay in regulatory approval of our star s laser system in japan 
laser upgrade revenue increased million from to million because a majority of our us customers upgraded their star s tm laser systems to the new star s tm model during since we began installing the star s upgrade in the fourth quarter of  we have upgraded approximately of the star s lasers based in the us accordingly  we anticipate that upgrade revenue will decline in the introduction of our new wavescan system generated a small amount of additional sales revenue in license  service and other revenue in was million lower than in mainly due to a decline in license and other procedure fees procedure fees from us customers  which was partially offset by increased us service revenue 
procedure fees declined due to a combination of lower volume of procedures for which visx earned procedure fees million and lower procedure prices million 
effective february   we reduced the price of our license fee from to per procedure performed on a visx laser in the us laser vision correction is not generally covered by medical insurance 
the decision to have laser vision correction surgery is influenced by many factors including consumers confidence in and perception of the health of the economy 
we believe the economic recession and drop in consumer confidence 
table of contents in were the principal causes of the decline in our procedure volume and the us laser vision correction market as a whole 
we believe that the rebound of the us economy and consumer confidence will provide renewed support for the us laser vision correction market in  though the timing and extent of the rebound is difficult to predict 
year ended december  change s costs and expenses cost of revenues percent of revenue marketing  general and administrative percent of revenue research  development and regulatory percent of revenue cost of revenues declined million  which was due to lower unit sales of laser systems approximately million  partially offset by additional cost of revenues for laser upgrades approximately million 
our gross profit margin was lower due predominately to the decline in our us procedure volume and the reduction in our license fee per procedure in february marketing  general and administrative expenses declined principally due to a million reduction in expense for reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables and million less in spending on marketing and promotional programs 
our policy is to accrue reserves against receivables based on our assessment of our customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
as a result of this analysis  our additions to reserves against accounts receivable were million in as compared to million in the reserves added in were higher than in other years because a number of customers developed significant problems due to a variety of factors including over expansion and the rapid transition in the us economy from high growth to contraction 
approximately million of receivables identified as potential problems in subsequently became uncollectible and were written off in our expenses in also included a charge to fully reserve a million long term note we advanced to a customer 
this long term note was subsequently written off due to the bankruptcy of this customer in our research and development expenses increased due to increased spending in our three main areas of focus new capabilities for the visx star tm excimer laser platform  development of new products such as our wavescan system and wavefront driven ablations  and research into new technologies 
we anticipate that our r d and regulatory expenses will total approximately million in other income expense lawsuits were filed against us in in connection with the activities of pillar point partners pillar point  a partnership between subsidiaries of visx and summit technologies  inc summit 
the purported class action lawsuits alleged  among other things  violations of various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws 
other claims involving pillar point were filed against visx  summit and others at various times 
the pillar point partnership was dissolved in  and in we and summit  now a subsidiary of alcon  inc  settled certain of these actions 
in connection with the settlements  visx paid a total of million in one time payments and related costs and fees 
as a result of the settlements  the lawsuits have been or we believe will likely be dismissed with prejudice 

table of contents compared to year ended december  change s revenue system sales percent of revenue license  service and other revenue percent of revenue total our laser system unit sales and revenue in international markets increased in over  but in the united states they declined from the prior year 
in international markets  the increase totaled million and was most significant in asian and latin american countries 
we believe this was due to a combination of factors including customers enthusiasm for visx s new products and technology  new distributors  and additional marketing programs 
the decline in united states sales of million was due principally to lower unit sales caused by increased competition  the slowdown in the economy  and customers deferring purchases until we began production of our next generation star s tm excimer laser system in the fourth quarter of average selling prices during were lower than in the prior year as the result of increased competition and the anticipated introduction of our next generation star s tmexcimer laser system and our wavescan system 
our us license revenue declined due to our reduction in february of our us license fee to per procedure from the we had charged since we first entered the us market in based on our analysis of sales data and developments in the us laser vision correction market during the first quarter of  we concluded that consumer concerns about the pricing of laser vision correction were dampening the industry s potential for growth 
in an effort to address these concerns and to help broaden the appeal for laser vision correction  we reduced our us license fee 
sales of visionkey cards for licensed procedures in the us increased in over however the benefit from the increase in unit volume million revenue from additional procedures at the new prices was not sufficient to offset the reduction in revenue approximately million resulting from the lower per procedure license fee 
year ended december  change s costs and expenses cost of revenues percent of revenue marketing  general and administrative percent of revenue research  development and regulatory percent of revenue cost of revenues increased in over primarily because we serviced a larger installed base of systems 
our gross profit margin was lower in than in due to lower license fees due to the reduction in per procedure license fee and lower average selling prices of laser systems as discussed in the preceding section on revenue 
our marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in over due to additions to our reserves for uncollectible amounts due from customers 
our policy is to accrue reserves against receivables based on our assessment of our customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
as a result of this analysis  our additions to reserves against accounts receivable due from customers were million in as compared to less than million in we increased our additions to reserves in because a number of customers developed significant problems due to a variety of factors including the rapid transition in the us economy from high growth to contraction  over expansion and increased competition 
in 
table of contents addition  in january we extended million to one customer under a five year note payable in quarterly installments bearing interest at approximately the prime bank rate with the goal of contributing to their expansion and the growth of the laser vision correction market as a whole in the united states 
in december we determined that the future collectibility of this note receivable was in doubt due to a significant deterioration of the customer s operations and financial position during the fourth quarter of accordingly  we reserved for this million long term note receivable in its entirety in the fourth quarter of  which was included in marketing  general and administrative expense 
excluding additions to reserves against amounts due from customers  our marketing  general and administrative expenses were lower in than in legal expenses declined because settlements were reached and trials were completed in several cases in the first half of this contrasts with during which we incurred substantial legal expenses due to the international trade commission itc trial regarding its investigation of nidek co  ltd 
nidek  the ftc administrative action  and other patent litigation 
marketing expenses declined principally because we eliminated our direct consumer advertising campaign and focused on other marketing programs in the us administrative expenses decreased due to lower payments to employees under performance based incentive programs 
we increased spending in research and development 
our efforts were focused on developing new capabilities for the visx star tm excimer laser platform  designing new products such as our wavescan system  and researching new technologies 
our regulatory expenses were lower  mainly due to reduced work outside the us we continued to conduct clinical studies and prepared submissions to obtain additional approvals from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
other income expense we settled a number of litigation matters during and paid a total of million in one time payments and related costs and fees in connection with these settlements 
we settled antitrust and other claims against visx filed by jon dishler and associated parties dishler 
this settlement included a resolution of the claims filed in by pillar point  summit partner  and visx partner against dishler 
we also settled a lawsuit filed by john taboada against stephen trokel  visx  and visx partner seeking  among other things  a declaration that taboada was the inventor of our us patent no 
b  and a payment of royalties received by visx for the patent 
in connection with the taboada settlement  the parties signed and filed with the court a stipulated judgment stating that dr 
trokel is the sole inventor of the patent  and taboada s proceeding seeking a stay of the reexamination of the patent was dismissed 
finally  we settled an action filed by a group of former clinical investigators of the system made by taunton technologies corporation a predecessor of visx in which the plaintiffs alleged federal antitrust law violations  breach of contract  and unjust enrichment

typically we experience an increase in procedure related revenue in the united states market in the first quarter of each calendar year 
we attribute this increase to consumers using the annual renewal of funding under the internal revenue service code section pre tax medical savings plan to purchase laser vision correction for themselves 
our equipment and procedure revenue tend to decline in the summer 
critical accounting policies we follow generally accepted accounting principles gaap for the united states in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses that we report in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and this could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues that could be material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
our critical accounting policies used in making these estimates and judgments are as follows 
revenue recognition we have three main sources of revenue system equipment sales  service  and license fees and related procedure revenue procedure revenue 
we recognize revenue in each of these categories in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under this standard  revenue is generally recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all of our sales are documented by contract or purchase orders specifying sales prices and terms 

table of contents within the us we directly handle the sale and installation of our systems and recognize revenue on these products after we have completed installation of systems at a customer s site 
at this point we accrue an estimate of the cost of warranty service to be provided in the future 
outside the us our standard terms are fob visx and we sell exclusively through independent  third party distributors who are generally responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty labor coverage for our products 
accordingly  we recognize sales revenue when we ship systems for customers outside the us and accrue an estimate of the cost of parts that we are obligated to provide under warranty 
for customers who purchase service contracts  we recognize service revenue over the term of the contract 
for customers without service contracts  we recognize service revenue when we provide service 
we record spare parts revenue upon shipment of the parts 
we recognize procedure revenue when we ship visionkey cards in the us and when we receive payments from third party licensees 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
if this is not the case  then we record revenue only as payments are received 
accounts receivable customers are evaluated for credit worthiness and we recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
after a receivable is recorded  we estimate the reserves necessary for receivables that will ultimately not be collectible from customers 
to develop this estimate we review all receivables and identify those accounts with problems 
for these problem accounts  we estimate individual  specific reserves based on our analysis of the payment history  operations and finances of each account 
for all other accounts  we review historical bad debt trends  general and industry specific economic trends  customer concentrations  and current payment patterns to estimate the reserve necessary to provide for payment defaults that cannot be specifically identified but can be expected with reasonable probability to occur in the future 
we face two particular challenges in estimating these reserves concentration of credit with certain large customers and the potential for significant change in the overall health of the national economies in the markets we serve 
unexpected deterioration in the health of either a large customer or a national economy could lead to a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories inventories consist of purchased parts  subassemblies and finished systems and are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand plus on order and compare this to our estimate of demand over the following months 
based on this analysis  we adjust our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
changes in competition  the economy  and technology can lead to variation in demand for our products 
if the change in demand is significant  we may need to adjust our inventory reserves 
all inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenues  accordingly any adjustment to inventory reserves would impact our reported cost of revenues 
legal contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal proceedings including those concerning intellectual property rights  claims that we violated antirust laws  and class actions filed under federal securities laws 
in cases brought against us we must assess the probability of an adverse decision 
if we believe it probable that we will lose in our defense and we can reasonably estimate the loss  we must accrue an estimate of the potential loss 
currently we do not believe it is probable that we will lose cases currently pending and  accordingly  have not accrued any reserves for legal settlements 
however  the results of these complex legal proceedings are very difficult to predict with certainty 
in addition  because a number of the proceedings have issues in common  an adverse determination in one proceeding could lead to adverse determinations in one or more of the other pending proceedings 
adverse determinations in any of these proceedings could limit our ability to collect equipment and use fees in certain markets  could give rise to significant monetary damages  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our laser system  and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash and working capital were as follows december  s cash working capital cash decreased by million in principally because we spent million to repurchase million shares of visx stock on the open market 
this was partially offset by million of net cash provided by operating activities and million received upon the exercise of stock options 
operating activities provided million of cash in  down from million provided in the principal factors that contributed to this difference are as follows 
net income declined by million due mainly to the decline in sales and the legal settlement of million pre tax 
deferred income tax assets increased by million due to timing differences that we anticipate will be realized in accounts receivable  net of reserves  declined in both years due to lower sales 
cash generated by these declines was million larger in than in due mainly to the correspondingly larger change in sales that year 
reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased in  then declined in contributed million to the difference in cash provided by operating activities 
accounts payable declined due to reductions in purchases of inventory in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the change in accrued liabilities was principally due to lower deferred revenue a backlog for laser upgrades grew in and a substantial portion was recognized as revenue in when the upgrades were shipped and installed and declines in warranty and compensation accruals 
interest income was lower in than in due to the decline in cash available for investment in interest bearing securities 
conversely  the average balance of cash invested in interest bearing securities and interest income were higher in than in on april   our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which up to million shares of visx common stock may be repurchased 
before repurchasing shares we consider a number of factors including market conditions  the market price of the stock  and the number of shares needed for employee benefit plans 
as a result  we cannot predict the number of shares that we may repurchase in the future 
purchases of short term investments represent reinvestment into short term investments of the proceeds from short term investments that matured and investment of cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding nor any credit agreements 
our normal credit terms granted to customers are net to days 
in an effort to promote the growth of the laser vision correction industry and the use of visx systems  in certain markets we provide long term financing to customers for their purchase of visx systems 
we consider a number of factors including industry practice  competition and our evaluation of customers credit worthiness in determining when to offer such financing 
we believe that our operations will provide sufficient cash flow to meet our working capital and capital equipment needs during the coming twelve months 
in addition  we have million of cash as of december  to provide for unforeseen contingencies and to support strategic objectives including the development or acquisition of new technologies and our stock repurchase program 
in august we signed a one year research and development agreement with medjet inc medjet under which we provide funding to medjet to pursue new ophthalmic technologies and products 
in addition  we signed an agreement with medjet that provides us with a one year option  for which we paid million  to acquire all outstanding medjet common stock in a merger transaction for per share in cash 
the closing of the potential merger is subject to medjet s shareholder approval and is subject to other customary conditions to closing 
at the same time  we paid million to purchase from a third party all outstanding shares of medjet s series b convertible preferred stock  which are entitled to votes equivalent to 
table of contents  shares of medjet common stock and vote together with medjet s common stock 
these shares owned by visx represent of medjet s voting stock 
in connection with these agreements  we also entered into a voting agreement with dr 
eugene gordon  founder of medjet  under which dr 
gordon has agreed to vote all of his shares of common stock in favor of the merger  and has agreed to sell all of his stock to visx in the event that visx offers to complete the merger 
dr 
gordon currently holds  shares  representing of medjet s voting stock 
lastly  we now have one of seven seats on medjet s board of directors 
we account for this investment under the equity method prescribed by apb under our r d agreement we paid approximately million to medjet to fund research and development work they performed during and anticipate higher funding from january through august we expense of the payments made to medjet as research  development and regulatory expense in our financial statements 
to exercise our option to acquire medjet  we would have to pay approximately million based on the per share purchase price and the number of shares of medjet common stock  options and warrants outstanding at december  new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standard board fasb approved for issuance statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
major provisions of these statements are as follows i all business combinations initiated after june  must use the purchase method of accounting  ii the pooling of interests method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated before july   iii intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability  iv goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually using a fair value approach  except in certain circumstances  and whenever there is an impairment indicator  v other intangible assets will continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives  vi in process research and development will continue to be written off immediately  vii all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting  viii effective january   goodwill existing as of june  will no longer be subject to amortization 
goodwill arising between june  and december  will not be subject to amortization 
upon adoption of sfas  on january   we will no longer be required to amortize goodwill 
however  since we have no goodwill assets or amortization  adoption of these statements will have no impact on our financial statements or results of operations 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
an impairment loss must be recognized if the net book value of long lived assets exceeds i the future cash flows to be generated by these assets  whether through continued operation or sale  ii the fair value of assets to be distributed to owners in a spinoff  or iii the fair value of productive assets for which they are exchanged 
this statement applies to long term leases  certain oil and gas properties  and long term prepaid assets 
it does not apply to goodwill  intangible assets not being amortized  investments in equity securities accounted for under the cost or equity method  and certain other types of long term assets 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe this statement will not have any material impact on visx s financial statements or results of operations 
in july  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf generally requires that consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be classified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as a reduction to revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf clarifies and modifies certain items discussed in eitf we are required to adopt these new standards no later than the quarter ending march  in accordance with the transition guidance in eitf  adoption will require the reclassification of financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes 
we believe that reclassification under eitf and eitf will not significantly affect our gross margin or net income  although reclassification will change the presentation of certain revenue and expense items contained within the financial statements 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty 
the factors set forth below  which are not the only risks facing us  may cause our actual results to vary from those contemplated by certain forward looking statements set forth in this report and should be considered carefully in addition to the other information presented in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our results of operations have varied widely in the past  and they could continue to vary significantly 
in addition  our actual results may differ significantly from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
accordingly  we believe that our results of operations in any given period may not be a good indicator of our future performance 
market acceptance 
our business depends upon broad market acceptance of laser vision correction by both doctors and patients in the united states and key international markets 
laser vision correction has penetrated less than of the eligible us population  and our profitability and continued growth will be largely dependent on increasing levels of market acceptance and procedure growth both in the united states and internationally 
although laser vision correction offers a more predictable outcome and more precise results than other surgical methods used to correct refractive disorders  it is not without risk 
potential complications and side effects include post operative discomfort  corneal haze an increase in the light scattering properties of the cornea during healing  glare halos undesirable visual sensations produced by bright lights  decreases in contrast sensitivity  temporary increases in intraocular pressure in reaction to procedure medication  modest fluctuations in refractive capabilities during healing  modest decrease in best corrected vision ie  with corrective eyewear  unintended over or under corrections  regression of effect  disorders of corneal healing  corneal scars  corneal ulcers  and induced astigmatism which may result in blurred or double vision and or shadow images 
consumers may be slow to adopt laser vision correction because of these complications or more general concerns relating to its safety and efficacy and a general resistance to surgery 
should either the ophthalmic community or the general population turn away from laser 
table of contents vision correction as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders  or if future technologies replaced laser vision correction  these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
patents and intellectual property 
our business is dependent on the enforceability and the validity of our united states and foreign patents 
we own over united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending 
although we are committed to protecting our proprietary technology  it is possible that one or more of our patents will be found to be invalid or unenforceable  or that a party against whom we are asserting claims of patent infringement will be found not to be infringing our patents 
such an outcome could result in  among other things  increased competition by new or existing competitors or the payment of substantial monetary damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operation 
competition 
intense competition in the laser vision correction industry could result in the loss of customers and an inability to attract new customers 
the medical device and ophthalmic laser industries are subject to intense competition and technological change 
not only does laser vision correction compete with more traditional vision correction options such as eyeglasses and contact lenses  it also competes with other technologies and surgical techniques such as corneal implants  intraocular lenses  and surgery using different types of lasers 
in addition  the market for laser vision correction systems has become increasingly competitive in recent years as a result of fda approval of several new laser systems 
the visx system competes with products marketed or under development by other laser and medical equipment manufacturers  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
competitors may be able to offer laser systems at a lower price  may price their laser systems as part of a bundle of products or services  may develop procedures that involve a lower per procedure cost  or may offer products that are perceived as preferable to the visx system 
in addition  medical companies  academic and research institutions and others could develop new therapies  including new medical devices or surgical procedures  for the conditions targeted by visx  which therapies could be more medically effective and less expensive than laser vision correction  and could potentially render laser vision correction obsolete 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
price competition 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  price competition  which has resulted in a decrease in prices for our products and which has impacted our revenues 
a number of factors  including the proliferation of competitors  have resulted in a increase in product pricing pressures faced by us 
we are also currently not collecting license fees from competitors that have not entered into licenses with us 
if we face additional pressure to decrease our prices  our revenue may decrease  and our business  financial position and results of operations may suffer 
unfavorable outcomes 
the possibility of long term side effects and adverse publicity regarding laser correction surgery could seriously harm our business 
laser vision correction is a relatively new procedure 
consequently  there is no long term follow up data beyond ten years  and longer term follow up data might reveal additional complications or unknown side effects 
any future reported side effects  other adverse events or unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx or any participant in the laser vision correction market may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
economic conditions 
laser vision correction is not subject to reimbursement from third party payors such as insurance companies or government programs  and economic conditions may cause our sales to decline 
the costs of laser vision correction are typically borne by individuals directly 
accordingly  individuals may be less willing to incur the procedure cost associated with laser vision correction in weak or uncertain economic conditions  as was evidenced during the recent economic downturn and following the events of september  any resulting decline in the number of visx systems sold or laser vision correction procedures performed may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
loss of significant customers 
if we lose one or more of our significant customers  or if purchases by one or more of our key customers decrease  our net sales may decline and our business could be harmed 
a 
table of contents significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a small number of customers 
laser vision centers  inc lvci accounted for  and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
tlc laser eye centers  inc tlc accounted for  and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
in august  lvci and tlc announced their intention to merge and expect the transaction will be completed in should we lose a major customer or if anticipated sales to a major customer do not materialize  our business  financial position and results of operations may suffer 
fixed short term expenses 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our earnings will decline if we do not meet our projected sales 
any shortfall in revenues below expectations would likely have an immediate impact on our earnings per share  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating expenses  which include sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if revenues fall below expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to such a shortfall 
governmental regulation 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
government regulation includes inspection of and controls over research and development  testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  pricing  record keeping  the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and samples and electronic records and electronic signatures 
in the united states  we must obtain fda approval or clearance for each medical device that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed outside of the united states are also subject to government regulation  which may be equally or more demanding 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
if a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product  our market value and operating results may decline 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our products  we will not be able to market these products  which would result in a decrease in our sales 
currently  we are actively pursuing approval for a number of our products from regulatory authorities in a number of countries  including  among others  the united states  countries in the european union and japan 
continued growth in our sales and profits will depend  in part  on the timely and successful introduction and marketing of some or all of these products 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials  yet cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
noncompliance with applicable united states regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  denial or withdrawal of pre marketing approvals  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
regulatory authorities outside of the united states may impose similar sanctions for noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
new products may not be commercially viable 
our research and development may not lead to new products that achieve commercial success 
we devote significant resources to research and development 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of a new product  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between three and seven years for a medical device 
each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic 
table of contents research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market such products successfully 
none of the products currently in our development pipeline may be approved by regulatory entities  and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
international operations 
we face risks due to our reliance on sales in international markets 
our future success will depend in part on the continued expansion of our international sales and operations 
in particular  during  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
our growing international presence exposes us to risks including the need for export licenses  unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other potential trade barriers and restrictions  political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  longer accounts receivable cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  foreign currency fluctuations  reduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries  and dependence on local distributors 
if one or more of these risks materialize  our sales to international customers may decrease and our costs may increase  which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results 
intellectual property disputes 
the laser vision correction industry has been the subject of substantial litigation  both in the united states and internationally  specifically focusing on patents and proprietary rights 
our patents are being challenged on several fronts 
generally  the litigation and other proceedings center on whether infringement of the patents has occurred  and on the validity or enforceability of the patents 
in addition  our use of patents and our business practices are being contested as violations of antitrust laws 
moreover  other companies own united states and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery with ultraviolet lasers  and one of our competitors has filed two lawsuits against us alleging that we infringe certain united states and foreign patents 
the results of these complex legal proceedings are very difficult to predict with certainty 
because a number of the proceedings have issues in common  an adverse determination in one proceeding could lead to adverse determinations in one or more of the other pending proceedings 
if we were found to infringe our competitors patents  we could be subject to significant monetary liability and we could be enjoined from distributing our products 
if our patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable or in the event that parties against whom visx is asserting patent infringement are found not to be infringing our patents  our ability to collect license fees from the parties to the litigation or from other sellers or users of laser vision correction equipment in the united states may suffer and our revenues may decline 
any one of these results could harm our business 
see note to our financial statements  litigation  for a detailed analysis of our currently pending legal proceedings 
product liability claims 
we have and may become subject to product liability claims 
we could be liable for injuries or damage resulting from use of the visx system 
in addition  a claim that an injury resulted from a defect in the visx system  even if successfully defended  could damage our reputation 
although we possess insurance customarily obtained by businesses of our type including insurance against product liability risks associated with the testing  manufacturing  and marketing of our products  product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
single sources for key components 
we depend on single and limited sources for key components 
if we lose one or more of these sources  delivery of our products could be delayed or prevented and our business would suffer 
the manufacture of visx systems is a complex operation involving numerous procedures 

table of contents several of these components are currently provided by a single vendor 
if any of these suppliers were to cease providing components  we would be required to locate and contract with a substitute supplier 
we could have difficulty identifying a substitute supplier in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were unable to produce the visx system in a cost effective or timely manner  or if the manufacturing of visx systems were interrupted  our business  financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
volatility of our stock price 
the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons  including announcements about us or our competitors  results or settlements of any litigation  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction of new technologies or products  changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  and changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in addition  the securities of many medical device companies  including visx  have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
confidentiality agreements 
we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we protect our proprietary technology  in part  through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
if any of our employees  consultants or others breach these confidentiality agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our competitors may learn of our trade secrets 
new technologies 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to develop new methods of vision correction  customers may not buy our products and our revenue may decline 
we must be able to manufacture and effectively market those products and persuade a sufficient number of eye care professionals to use the new products we introduce 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced by one of our competitors or if we announce a new product that  in either case  represents a substantial improvement over our existing products 
antitakeover provisions in our charter documents 
in  we adopted a stockholder rights plan  which we subsequently amended in the presence of this plan could make it more difficult for a third party to engage in a takeover attempt  even a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price for our common stock 
in addition  the presence of the plan could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions may also impact the amount of interest investors have in our business 
critical accounting policies 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles for the united states in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses that we report in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and this could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues that could be material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
our critical accounting policies used in making these estimates and judgments are identified
