item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  which consists principally of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  which consist of deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yields earned on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s results of operations also are affected by the provision for loan losses resulting from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the level of its non interest income  including investment service fees  account service fees and related income and gains and losses from the sales of loans and securities  the level of its non interest expense  including salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  data processing services  deposit insurance premiums  advertising  other operating costs  and income tax expense 
the bank is a community oriented bank  which emphasizes customer service and convenience 
as part of this strategy  the bank offers products and services designed to meet the needs of its customers 
the company generally has sought to achieve long term financial growth and strength by increasing the amount and stability of its net interest income and non interest income and by maintaining a high level of asset quality 
in pursuit of these goals  the company has adopted a business strategy emphasizing growth in basic financial services 
the focus is on commercial and construction lending  commercial deposits and treasury management  consumer deposits and loans and trust and investment management 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the bank  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the bank to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the bank evaluates estimates on an on going basis  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  other real estate owned  other than temporary investment impairments  pension and post retirement benefits  the stock option plan  recourse liabilities and income taxes 
the bank bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the bank believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and other than temporary investment security impairment 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses  which are probable and reasonably determinable based upon an evaluation of the loan portfolio 
homogeneous portfolios of loans  which include residential mortgage  home equity and other consumer loans  are evaluated as a group 
commercial business  commercial mortgage and construction loans are evaluated individually 
specific portions of the allowance are developed by analyzing individual loans for adequacy of collateral  cash flow and other risks which may be unique to that particular loan 
general portions of the allowance are developed by grading individual loans in the commercial and construction portfolios and applying loss factors by grade 
the general portion of the allowance also includes loss factors applied to the homogeneous portfolios as a group 
the loss factors applied to graded loans were developed based on the company s loss history for loans with similar attributes as well as input from the company s primary banking regulators 
loss factors are applied to homogeneous loans based upon prior loss experience of the portfolio delinquency trends and the volume of non performing loans 
although management believes it has used the best information available to it in making such determinations  and that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary  and net income may be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the level of the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged to operations 
loan losses  other than those incurred on loans held for sale  are charged directly against the allowance and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 
for purposes of applying the measurement criteria for impaired loans  the company excludes large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  primarily consisting of residential real estate loans and consumer loans as well as commercial business loans with balances of less than  for applicable loans  the company evaluates the need for impairment recognition when a loan becomes non accrual or earlier if  based on management s assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all proceeds under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
at and during the years ended june   and  the recorded investment in impaired loans was not significant 
the company s policy for the recognition of interest income on impaired loans is the same as for non accrual loans 
a portion of an impaired loan is charged off when the company determines that foreclosure is probable and the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment of the impaired loan 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  as well as tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available 
based on management s evaluation of the likelihood of realization  no valuation allowance has been established 
because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part  be beyond the bank s control  it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support realizable value equal to or greater than carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
business strategy growth 
the company seeks to increase its assets through internal growth and by expanding its operations 
during fiscal  the company expects to open two new branches in fiscal to broaden its deposit base and to introduce several new commercial lending and deposits products 
in the company s assets increased by million  or from million at june  to million at june  resulting mainly from the million growth in the loan portfolio 
such loan growth was funded primarily by borrowings 
emphasis on commercial lending 
the company has been and will continue to expand its higher yielding portfolios of commercial real estate and commercial business lending 
this strategy is reflected in the shifting composition of the company s loan portfolio 
the company s commercial real estate  commercial business and construction and land acquisition loans comprised of its total loan portfolio at june  compared to at june  single family and multi family residential loans comprised of the company s loan portfolio at june  as compared to at june  maintain loan quality 
management believes that maintaining high loan quality is key to achieving and sustaining long term financial success 
accordingly  the company has sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk by using underwriting standards which management believes are conservative and by generally limiting its origination of loans to its market area 
the company s non accrual loans decreased by thousand to thousand at june  with the decrease primarily related to consumer loans 
the company s ratio of non performing assets to total assets at june  was and its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was  while at june  the percentages were and  respectively 
stable source of liquidity 
the company purchases investment securities that management believes to be appropriate for liquidity  yield and credit quality in order to achieve a managed and more predictable source of liquidity to meet loan demand and  to a lesser extent  a stable source of interest income 
the portfolio totaled  in the aggregate  million at june  compared to million at june  in addition  the company had short term interest bearing deposits of million at june  compared to million at june  emphasis on deposits and customer service 
the company  as a community based financial institution  is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide a stable source of funding 
the company has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of high quality service  relatively low service fees  customer convenience  an experienced staff and a strong commitment to the communities in which it serves 
lower costing deposits  which exclude time deposits  totaled million or of the company s total deposits at june   as compared to million at june   a million or increase 
this increase in lower costing deposits is primarily attributable to the continuing effort to grow core deposits 
pursuant to the company s strategy  the major focus in will continue to be on increasing commercial and consumer core deposits and relying less on higher rate municipal certificates 
in addition  the company has not used brokered deposits as a source of funds and presently has no plans to do so in the future 
asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the company is to manage and control its interest rate risk of the bank subsidiary  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the bank s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the company to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the company  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of the bank s deposit accounts  that a portion of money market  now accounts and savings deposits are partially sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  the interest sensitive portions of these deposits are classified in the less than one year categories with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index  if any  are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are typically subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table that follows does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities  which contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity position for the bank throughout the year

operating results interest income taxable equivalent basis interest income is analyzed on a tax equivalent basis  ie  an adjustment is made for analysis purposes only  to increase interest income by the amount of savings of federal income taxes  which the company realizes by investing in certain tax free municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax exempt organizations 
in this way  the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more readily compared 
total interest income decreased to million during fiscal  a million or decrease over the prior fiscal year 
this was due to a million decrease in interest income because of lower average rates during the period which was offset  in part  by a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets which contributed thousand of additional interest income 
total interest income increased to million during fiscal  a million or increase over fiscal this increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  which contributed million and was offset in part by a decline of million due to lower average rates 
the yield on average interest earning assets was  and for fiscal year  and  respectively  reflecting the decline in general market rates of interest 
interest expense total interest expense decreased to million during fiscal  a million or decrease over the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a significant decrease in rates resulting in a million decrease in interest expense which was offset  in part  by an increase in average balances for deposits and borrowings resulting in an increase in interest expense of 
million

net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased  or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  compared to a increase of million from fiscal to fiscal net interest margin  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was for the year ended june   compared to in fiscal and during fiscal as the company s interest margin was compressed in by declining market rates on interest earning assets while interest bearing liability rates increased from to 
provision for loan losses the company s provision for loan losses was   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
these additions to the allowance for loan losses are due to the company s focus on building a larger loan portfolio of commercial and industrial loans which typically carry a greater risk of loss than the company s traditional loan portfolios  such as mortgages and real estate loans 
this change in the character of the loan portfolio  the current depressed economic conditions and management s assessment of the inherent risk of loss existing in the loan portfolio determined the amount necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses to an appropriate level 
at june   the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of net loans compared to million or of net loans at june  the company establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which management believes covers all known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in establishing the provision  management considers among other things  the mix of loans being booked  the delinquency trends  the volume of non performing loans  prior loss experience of the portfolio  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
although management believes it has used the best information available to it in making such determinations  and that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary  and net income may be adversely affected if the circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
non interest income total non interest income decreased  or to million for the year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year 
the principal reason for this decrease was a  impairment loss on a low income housing revenue bond and a  impairment loss on a revenue bond involving a building and related property that are leased to various agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
these losses totaling  were offset by the following investment services income increased  or to million  service charges and fees increased  or because of increased activity  gains on the sale of loans increased  gains on available for sale securities increased  and other income increased  these security gains were offset by a decrease in gains on trading account securities of  total non interest income increased  or to million for the year ended june   from the prior fiscal year 
investment services income increased  or to million 
an increase in checking account fees  as the result of an increased number of accounts  and an increase in the fees earned on the bank s debit card due to increased usage and also an increased number of cardholders  contributed to the increase of  or in service charges and fees in fiscal also contributing were increases in gains on the sale of loans of  gains on trading account securities of  gains on the sale of available for sale securities of  and other income of  these gains were offset by a loss on impaired securities of  operating expenses total operating expenses decreased  or to million for the year ended june  compared to fiscal the decrease in operating expenses over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of  or in advertising expenses relating to print advertising because the company moved to a more cost effective  proactive direct sales approach 
other expenses decreased by  or due to decreases in consulting  printing  donations  supplies and other expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of  or in salaries and employee benefits resulting from normal salary adjustments effective july   additional officer level staff  bonuses and the general increase in employee benefit costs 
also  occupancy and equipment expense increased  or resulting from the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and the addition of a new branch office in kennett square 
total operating expenses increased million or to million for the year ended june  compared to fiscal the increase in operating expenses in fiscal over the prior fiscal year was due to the following a salary and employee benefits increased  or 
salary and incentive payments increased  because of annual salary increases to existing employees  additional employees and for incentives to employees who achieve their goals  retirement plan contributions increased  group health insurance increased  payroll taxes  because of higher payroll costs and more employees increased  and directors compensation and education expenses increase  b occupancy and equipment expense increased  or consisting primarily of an increase of  in computer related expenses  a  increase in utilities and insurance  and a  increase in repairs and maintenance make up a majority of the increase  c data processing increased  or due principally to the introduction of our new eservices products ebank for internet banking  evoice for hour telephone banking  and ecorp for business banking  d deposit insurance premiums decreased  or because of regulatory changes  e advertising increased  or  resulting primarily from a bank image campaign and the marketing of our new electronic internet banking products discussed above  f other expenses increased  or due to the significant increases in legal fees of  which include the cost of the interim president for approximately five months  audit and accounting services of  because of special projects including our initial fdicia compliance work  consulting expenses of  for various non recurring special projects  printing expense of  because of new promotion and explanatory material related to eservices  donations of  resulting from increased community involvement including approximately  to a local school   for expenses related to the relocation of the new president  and  for increases in other operating expenses 
income taxes the company incurred income tax expense of million during fiscal the primary reason for the increase in income tax expense in fiscal compared to fiscal of  was due to higher pre tax income and a lower portion of the company s pre tax income being comprised of tax free interest income 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended june  the company incurred income tax expense of  for the year ended june   compared to million during fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease in income tax expense was a decrease in pretax income  an increase in tax free income and an increase in federal low income housing tax credits for qualified federally approved projects in fiscal the effective tax rate was for the year ended june  capital resources the company s assets totaled million at june   as compared with million as of june   principally due to a million increase in loans receivable  net to million from million at june  combined with a million increase in cash and cash equivalents from million at june  to million at june  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities from million at june  to million at june  liabilities increased million 
borrowings increased million from at june  to million at june  and the company issued million of trust preferred securities 
these increases were used to replace deposits as a funding source by million as deposits decreased from million at june  to million at june  as well as to fund the increase in assets noted above 
the decline in deposits primarily resulted from decreases in higher rate municipal deposits in connection with the implementation of the company s business plan 
stockholders equity increased million to million at june   from million at june   as a result of net income earned of million during fiscal  and proceeds totaling  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
the increase in stockholders equity also reflected the effect of a decrease in the net unrealized loss on the value of securities available for sale of  the net unrealized loss of million at june  declined to a net unrealized loss of  at june  the increases in equity were offset in part by the payment of cash dividends of million as well as the cost of repurchasing shares of our common stock totaling of  and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with the stock dividend paid during fiscal asset quality classified assets include non performing loans which are comprised of loans and reo and totaled  at june   compared to million at june  non performing loans to total assets was 
at june   compared to 
at june  non performing loans at june   consisted of eleven residential mortgage loans in the amount of  and eight consumer loans totaling  the company has one reo property recorded at fair value less selling costs at  at june  at june  and  the company s classified loans  which consisted of loans classified as substandard  doubtful  loss  and reo  totaled million and million  respectively 
included in the assets classified substandard at june  and  were all loans days past due and loans which are less than days delinquent  but inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged  as well as a well defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
included as substandard at june  are two loans totaling approximately million  which are current but have been listed as substandard and are being closely monitored 
in addition to non performing loans and reo  classified assets include three municipal authority revenue bond investments that had an aggregate balance of million at june   after a write down on two of the bonds totaling  after the write down  two of the bonds have a carrying value of million and both of these bonds involve buildings and related property that are leased to various agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania under long term lease arrangements with renewal options 
of the total balance of million  thousand are interest bearing bonds and the remainder of million are zero coupon bonds with maturities extending up to june the third classified bond has a balance  after write down  of million  an interest rate of and matures in june this bond involves low income scattered housing in chester county under a housing and urban development program 
the office of housing and urban development hud has indicated that it will provide funds to build additional housing which would be donated to this bond issue and  when sold  would reduce the losses incurred on the bonds 
these classified investments are closely monitored and fairly stated at june  based on available information 
there can be no assurance that further subsequent adverse or positive developments may occur  in which case  additional adjustments to these investments may be forthcoming 
liquidity and capital resources management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  repayments  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  sales of assets available for sale  maturities and calls of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and callable investments are greatly influenced by the movement of interest rates in general  economic conditions and competition 
the company manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a deposit balance deemed appropriate and desirable 
although the company s deposits represent the majority of its total liabilities  the company has also utilized other borrowing sources  namely fhlbp advances 
in addition to its ability to obtain advances from the fhlbp under several different credit programs  the company has established a line of credit with the fhlbp  in an the amount million 
this line of credit is available for liquidity purposes 
at june  there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as fhlbp overnight deposits 
on a longer term basis  the company maintains a strategy of investing in various lending and investment securities products 
during the year ended june   the company used its sources of funds to primarily fund loan commitments and maintain a substantial portfolio of investment securities  and to meet its ongoing commitments to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals 
as of june   the company had million in commitments to fund loan originations 
the majority of these commitments are anticipated to be funded by december  in addition  as of june   the company had undisbursed loans in process for construction loans of million and million in undisbursed lines of credit 
the company has also issued million in commercial letters of credit fully secured by deposit accounts or real estate at june  the management of the company believes that the company has adequate resources  including principal prepayments and repayments of loans and investment securities and borrowing capacity  to fund all of its commitments to the extent required 
for regulatory purposes  liquidity is defined as a ratio of cash and certain marketable securities that can be readily converted into cash to total deposits and short term borrowings 
at june   liquidity for the bank as defined under these guidelines was 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company on a consolidated basis are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over a short period of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
interest rates declined from january through december but there has been no movement in rates since december as a result  loans  which are linked to an index such as the london interbank offered rate libor or prime rate  were repriced at lower interest rates and deposit products have repriced as deposits rates are adjusted 
the principal source of deposits  the certificates of deposit  will adjust only when they mature and are renewed by the customers 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the yields on interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities as discussed in the asset liability management in item hereof 
although interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a useful measurement tool and contributes towards effective asset liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
the company utilizes an income simulation modeling to measure the company s interest rate risk and to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company is able to calculate an estimate of net interest income for the year ending june   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments in existence at june  the company has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling in monthly increments rate ramps 
rate ramps assume that all interest rates increase or decrease in monthly increments evenly throughout the period modeled 
economic value of equity eve estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities 
upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility in relation to such interest rate movements in relation to an unchanged environment 
this method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer term repricing risks and options in the company s balance sheet 
the following table reflects the estimated economic value of equity at risk and the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets at june   resulting from shocks to interest rates 
year ended june  change in interest economic value rates in basis points of equity eve ratio eve equity rate shock amount change change eve assets change dollars in thousands static  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in net present value npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented above assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective and  therefore  has focused its efforts on increasing the company s yield cost spread through wholesale and retail opportunities
