item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from copper mountain s inception in march through december  its operating activities related primarily to developing  building and testing prototype products  building its technical support infrastructure  commencing the staffing of its marketing  sales and customer service organizations  and establishing relationships with its customers 
we commenced shipments of our copperedge product family in september  including line cards for these copper edge systems and our copperrocket dsl customer premise equipment  or dsl cpe 
our revenue is generated primarily from sales of our central office based equipment our copperedge dsl concentrators  or ce  the related wide area network cards  line cards and  to a lesser extent  from sales of our dsl cpe 
additionally  we sell network management software which provides monitoring and management capabilities for the ce  revenues from which have not been material to date 
we also sell our copperedge dsl concentrators  or ce to customers in the multiple tenant unit  or mtu  market 
for the year ended december   sales to our three largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  of which sales to mpower communications  versatel and rhythms netconnections rhythms accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively 
while the level of sales to any specific customer is anticipated to vary from period to period  we expect that we will continue to have significant customer concentration for the foreseeable future 
in august  rhythms filed a petition for chapter protection with the us bankruptcy court 
we do not expect any future sales to rhythms 
our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the other significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could among other things reduce or delay our net revenue  adversely impact our ability to sustain or achieve annual or quarterly profitability and adversely impact our ability to generate positive cash flow  and  as a consequence  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the future  we expect that revenues  if any  will be substantially dependent on sales of our new vantedge product 
we expect that the vantedge product will be generally available for sale beginning in the summer of  however  we may not be successful in introducing vantedge by that time or generating revenues via vantedge at that time or thereafter 
we market and sell our products directly to telecommunications service providers and through distributors 
we generally recognize revenue from product sales or sales type leases upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimated and the sales type lease criteria are met 
no revenue is recognized on products shipped on a trial basis 
estimated sales returns  based on historical experience by product  are recorded at the time the product revenue is recognized 
to date  significant revenues generated from international sources are entirely comprised of sales to versatel 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors including competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  costs of components and sub assemblies  costs from our contract manufacturers  the mix of products or system configurations sold and the volume and timing of sales of follow on line cards for systems shipped in prior periods 
to date  gross margin on sales of our dsl access systems and related wide area network and line cards  typically sold as combined systems  have been higher than gross margin on sales of dsl cpe 
furthermore  combined systems are not generally fully populated ie  less than the total number of line cards which each system can support when sold 
when our customers add more subscribers than are supported in the initial configuration  we expect that these customers will purchase additional line cards from us to increase subscriber capacity 
the sale of additional line cards generates higher gross margin than the initial sale of combined systems 
gross margin on our dsl cpe is expected to decline in the future and we expect to face pricing competition which may result in lower average selling prices for these products as other suppliers of copper mountain compatible cpe enter the market 
we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  program management  documentation control and product repairs at our facility in san diego  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue during the periods presented consists of payments to the contract manufacturers plexus corporation and flextronics international ltd 
we selected our manufacturing partners with the goal of lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
however  we cannot assure you that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
during the year ended december  and we recorded charges to cost of revenue for inventory on hand and on order totaling million and million  respectively  including charges that were expected to be non recurring of million and million  respectively 
the amounts of the charges were determined based on estimates of the amounts we were committed to purchase and the anticipated demand for our products at the time the charges were taken 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
in particular  information provided by our vendors to estimate these charges related to the quantity and price of goods committed to may be lower or higher than the estimates made in and in also  our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
accordingly  actual demand for our products could be materially less or more than our estimates 
the ultimate amount of inventory purchase commitments and ultimate amount of excess inventory cost incurred could differ materially from our estimates as a result of these uncertainties 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and enhancement of our network management software 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product objectives and  as a result  we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  management information systems and administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  bad debt expenses and other general corporate expenses 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of million in bad debt expense related to an investment in a sales type lease 
this charge was estimated based on an updated credit assessment of the lessee 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
future payments received from the lessee that are not estimated to be collected  if any  will be recorded as a reduction to bad debt expense and as interest income 
prior to the year ended december   amortization of deferred stock compensation resulted from the granting of stock options to employees with exercise prices per share determined to be below the fair values per share for financial reporting purposes of our common stock at dates of grant 
during the year ended december   additional deferred compensation was recorded as part of the purchase price of onprem networks corporation 
during the second quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with our stock option exchange program see note of the notes to financial statements 
during the third and fourth quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with a grant of restricted stock to employees 
the intrinsic value of the options to purchase common stock granted under the exchange program will be re measured at the end of each period for the life of the option 
we expect that the total amount of deferred compensation expense that will be recognized under the exchange program could vary from period to period and the ultimate amount of deferred compensation expense that will be recognized is not currently determinable 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
over the vesting period of the individual options 
we recorded total deferred stock compensation of million from inception to december  and amortized million from inception to december  in august  the company granted  shares of restricted common stock to certain employees 
the shares  which are restricted as to sale or transfer until vesting  will vest one year from the date of grant and ratably each month thereafter for a period of months 
the related net compensation expense of approximately million will be amortized over the vesting period of two years 
in october  the company granted  shares of restricted common stock to certain employees 
the shares  which are restricted as to sale or transfer until vesting  will vest monthly ratably after one year of service for a total vesting period of months 
the related net compensation expense of approximately million will be amortized in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
over the vesting period of two years 
deferred stock compensation and amortization of deferred stock compensation could materially increase or decrease in future periods 
on march   the company announced that it had adopted a business plan to re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
this restructuring plan was largely completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  the company recorded charges of million during the three months ended march  these charges primarily relate to consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets as well as excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
employee reductions occurred in almost all areas of the company  including operations  marketing  sales and administrative areas 
as a result of this plan  the company had reduced its non temporary work force by approximately positions 
substantially all reductions related to this plan occurred prior to march  on august   the company announced that it had adopted a business plan to again re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
this restructuring plan is expected to largely be completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  the company recorded charges of million during the three months ended september  these charges primarily relate to consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets as well as excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
employee reductions occurred in all areas of the company 
as a result of this plan  the company reduced its non temporary work force by approximately additional positions 
substantially all reductions occurred prior to september  as a part of these plans  the carrying values of certain assets were written down 
the impaired assets include furniture  leasehold improvements  computers and other assets used in certain of the areas of the company impacted by the reduction in force 
the projected future cash flows from these assets were less than the carrying values of the assets 
the carrying values of the assets held for sale and the assets to be held and used were reduced to their estimated fair values based on the present value of the estimated expected future cash flows 
estimated expected future cash flows for the impaired assets are not significant 
in the year ended december   the company recorded losses from impairment of assets of million  which were recorded as restructuring costs 
the cost of these losses was previously estimated to be million 
this estimate was reduced by the utilization of assets  primarily laboratory equipment  previously estimated to be held for disposition 
substantially all of the impaired assets are being held for disposition and will not continue to be depreciated 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was reduced by million as a result of this charge 
the company estimates that depreciation expense will be reduced by million  million  million and million for the years ending december    and  respectively  as a result of this charge 
also as part of these plans  the company elected to consolidate its operations and attempt to sublease certain of its facilities  which housed portions of its operations  marketing  sales and administrative activities 
in the year ended december   the company recorded estimated excess lease costs of million which were recorded as restructuring costs 
estimated excess lease costs are based on assumptions of differences between lease payments and sublease receipts that could be realized on potential subleases and assumed carrying terms 
these assumptions are based on reasonably possible rates and terms from other recent leases of comparable properties 
the excess lease costs were previously estimated to be million 
the increase in this estimate is attributable to an increase in the estimated holding periods for the remaining leases and decreased estimated sublease receipts based on continuing deterioration in the market for comparable rental office space 
the rates and terms of the actual sub leases may differ materially from these estimates which could result in changes in the restructuring charge recognized during the year ended december  future cash outlays related to these plans are expected to be completed in future minimum amounts due under sub lease receivables as of december  are as follows in thousands year ending december  total minimum lease payments  details of the restructuring charges are as follows in s reserve balance at december  cash non cash charge activity impairment of assets non cash   excess lease costs cash    elimination of job responsibilities cash   in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
accordingly  management determined that the estimated future cash flows from certain intangible assets acquired in the purchase of onprem networks corporation would likely not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
the company calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the year ended december  the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in the company s strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market

total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income interest expense 

income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to significantly fewer sales of our ce and ce dsl access concentrators and related line cards 
sales to our four largest customers for the year ended december   northpoint  lucent  mcleodusa and rhythms netconnections  decreased from million  million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  to an aggregate of million for the year ended december  during  northpoint and rhythms netconnections filed petitions for chapter protection with the us bankruptcy court 
there are no expected future sales to northpoint or rhythms netconnections 
during  mcleodusa filed a petition for chapter protection with the us bankruptcy court 
future sales to mcleodusa  if any  may be substantially less than historical sales 
sales to our three largest customers for the year ended december   mpower communications  versatel and rhythms netconnections  were million  million and million  respectively 
our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the other significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
our future sales will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully introduce  commercialize and sell our vantedge product 
gross margin 
our gross margin decreased from million in to million in the decrease in gross margin occurred primarily because of charges taken during the year ended december  to reduce inventory to an estimated net realizable value  a decrease in net revenue  decreased average selling prices and decreased production volumes 
gross margin percentages also decreased on a year over year basis  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recorded charges totaling million related to future inventory purchase commitments of finished products and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements  including charges of million which were expected to be non recurring and excess inventory on hand compared to comparable charges of million  including charges of million which were expected to be non recurring for the year ended december  before the impact of these charges  gross margin as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  was relatively consistent with that of the prior year 
research and development 
our research and development expenses were relatively consistent at million in compared to million in during  increases in consulting and services and salaries and benefits were offset by decreases in spending on prototype equipment  employee recruiting and travel costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from in to in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue during we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the purpose of enhancing current products  reducing the cost of current products and developing new products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  decreased promotional and product marketing expenses  decreased sales commissions associated with lower net revenue  decreased expenses related to customer support and decreased travel costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue during general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in bad debt expense  decreased staffing for finance  management information systems  and human resources  and reductions in recruiting and facility related expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from in to in this increase was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue during amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased from million in to million in we purchased onprem networks corporation on february  for approximately million 
as a result of the purchase we recorded purchased intangibles of approximately million 
immediately following the purchase we wrote off million of in process research and development in for projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
such amount was determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser based upon the present value of estimated future cash flow contributions from the identified projects 
the remaining purchased intangibles were being amortized over a three year period from the date of the acquisition 
during the second quarter of  the company calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in the company s strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market 
in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
the company estimates that amortization of purchased intangibles will be reduced by million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively  as a result of this charge 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income generated from lower average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in and decreased average yields on such investments 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the net loss for the year ended december  and the estimate that it is not probable that our deferred tax assets generated from the net loss in will be realized based on anticipated future results 
years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increased commercial acceptance of dsl technology  the commercial market acceptance of our products  and investments made in our marketing and sales organization 
incremental sales made to our established customers accounted for approximately million of the increase with the remaining million of the increase being derived from new customer relationships 
sales to our four largest customers of fiscal  northpoint  lucent  mcleodusa and rhythms netconnections  were million  million  zero and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to million  million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  during  northpoint and rhythms netconnections filed petitions for chapter protection with the us bankruptcy court 
we do not expect any future sales to northpoint or rhythms netconnections 
during  mcleodusa filed a petition for chapter protection with the us bankruptcy court 
future sales to mcleodusa  if any  may be substantially less than historical sales 
in addition  our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
gross margin 
our gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in net revenue for the period 
gross margin percentages decreased on a year over year basis  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million of which million relates to future inventory purchase commitments of finished products and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements and million relates to excess inventory on hand at december  before the impact of these charges  gross margin as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  was consistent with the prior year 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses related to an increase in our engineering staff  increased prototype material costs  increased facility related costs  and higher depreciation related to an increase in capital equipment 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of an increase in our net revenue during we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the purpose of enhancing current products  reducing the cost of current products and developing new products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  increased expenses related to customer support  increased sales commissions associated with higher net revenue  and increased promotional and product marketing expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of an increase in our net revenue in general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from for to for this increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense  increased staffing for finance  management information systems  and human resources  and growth in recruiting and facility related expenses 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles increased from zero for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we purchased onprem networks corporation on february  for approximately million 
as a result of the purchase we recorded purchased intangibles of approximately million 
immediately following the purchase we wrote off million of in process research and development for projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
such amount was determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser based upon the present value of estimated future cash flow contributions from the identified projects 
the remaining purchased intangibles is being amortized over a three year period from the date of the acquisition 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased from million in to million in this increase reflects an increase in interest income generated from higher average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in  which included the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in may of and cash generated from operating activities during income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for was compared to for the higher tax rate is primarily a result of nondeductible charges for purchased in process technology and amortization of goodwill 
prior to the year ended december   we did not record a tax provision benefit due to our historical net losses 
during the first quarter of  the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets was eliminated as the realization of such assets became probable based on anticipated results 
the reduction of the valuation allowance decreased the tax provision by approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reestablished a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to deductions from employee stock option exercises 
when recognized  the tax benefit of these deferred assets will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources currently  the company is not generating sufficient revenue to fund its operations 
we expect our operating losses  net operating cash outflows and capital expenditures to continue if we are unable to increase sales 
on march  and august   the company announced that it had adopted business plans to re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to decrease our operating expenses significantly below current levels and still remain viable and competitive 
if we are unable to realize sufficient savings from re sizing our business  and or sufficiently increase our revenues  our ability to deploy and service our products  fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures could be significantly impaired 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term marketable investments of million 
included in short term marketable investments is an investment in commercial paper issued by southern california edison company at a carrying value of approximately million which matured in february and was fully paid in march in the amount of approximately million 
the resulting realized gain will be reflected in the company s financial statement for all periods that include the three months ending march  we currently require approximately million to million in cash per quarter to fund our operations  and we presently expect that this rate of quarterly cash use to continue through as a result  we believe that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
these estimates reflect various assumptions  including the assumptions that the sales of our existing products will continue at approximately the same levels as in the fourth quarter of  that testing  continued development and commercialization of our new vantedge product proceeds as planned  that we do not incur significant additional expenses related to litigation including any adverse determination in any of the litigation described elsewhere in this form k under the heading legal proceedings 
any of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect 
in particular  revenue from sales of our products have decreased in each of the previous five quarters 
in future quarters  it is unclear whether we will continue to generate revenue from sales of products at the same levels  if at all 
moreover  as a result of our dispute with flextronics  flextronics has filed a suit which seeks  among other things to attach approximately million of our cash as security for the amount of damage that they claim we owe to them 
if they are successful in this effort  our available cash will be reduced by million at least temporarily and perhaps permanently 
we believe that this suit is without merit and we intend to defend against it vigorously 
finally  the development and commercialization of our vantedge product might be delayed or might require the expenditure of significantly more funds than currently anticipated  in which case our liquidity and capital resources would be adversely affected 
in order to fund our operations beyond the second quarter of  we expect that we will have to raise additional funds 
we anticipate that we will have to seek equity or long term debt financing in the private or public markets to obtain the funds we need to continue operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms and conditions favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms and conditions  we may be unable to fund our ongoing operations 
in addition  our inability to obtain cash may 
impair our ability to successfully introduce  commercialize and generate revenues from our vantedge product  
damage our customers perceptions of us and our management team  
inhibit our ability to sell our products to a customer base which values financial strength and stability and 
decrease our stock price 
in august  the company entered into an  credit facility with a financing company for the purchase of equipment under a capital lease agreement 
as of december  and  the full amount of funds available under this credit facility had been utilized 
in june  the company secured a million credit facility with a financing company for the purchase of equipment under a capital lease agreement 
as of december  and  the full amount of funds available under this credit facility had been utilized 
cash provided by or used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue and an increase in restructuring costs  partially offset by decreases in selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily the result of increases in depreciation and amortization  a write off of in process research and development and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in excess of the decrease in net income from million in compared to net income of million in cash provided by or used in investing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior period was the result of decreased net purchases of marketable investments  partially offset by an increase in the purchase of computers and other equipment 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior period was the result of decreased net purchases of marketable investments  partially offset by an increase in the purchase of computers and other equipment 
cash provided by or used in financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock and an increase in payments made on capital lease obligations 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the receipt of the proceeds from our initial public offering in we have no material commitments other than an obligation to purchase certain finished product and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements  obligations under our credit facilities and operating and capital leases 
see notes  and of notes to financial statements 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts and marketing efforts 
we expect to continue to expend amounts on property and equipment related to facility infrastructure  computer equipment and for research and development laboratory and test equipment to support on going research and development operations 
our capital requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of our business plan and as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments or if 
demand for our products and services is less than or more than expected  
flextronics is successful in restricting the use of our cash  
our obligation to purchase certain finished product and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements is less than or more than expected  
our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  
we make acquisitions  
we accelerate or delay development or availability of new products including but not limited to our vantedge broadband services concentrator or otherwise alter the schedule or targets of our business plan implementation  or 
there is an adverse or favorable determination in any litigation to which we are a party 
we intend to use our cash and other resources for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we may also use a portion of our cash and other resources to acquire complementary businesses or other assets 
the amounts actually expended for these purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including revenue growth  if any  planned capital expenditures  and the extent and timing of our entry into target markets 
our management intends to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
summarized quarterly data unaudited the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information  for the eight quarters ended december  we believe this information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  except for a charge to write off certain intangible assets of million  a charge related to excess inventory on hand and on order of million  a restructuring charge of million  a million charge related to the collectibility of certain receivables and a charge related to the investment in commercial paper of southern california edison of million for the year ended december  and a charge to write off purchased in process research and development of million  a charge related to excess inventory on hand and on order of million  and a million charge related to the insolvency of northpoint for the year ended december  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our long term debt arrangements and our investments in certain held to maturity securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments at december  at december   the company held an investment in commercial paper issued by southern california edison company 
the investment is included in short term marketable investments at a carrying value of approximately million which matured in february and was fully paid in march in the amount of approximately million 
the resulting realized gain will be reflected in the company s financial statements for all periods that include the three months ending march
