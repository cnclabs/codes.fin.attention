item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in august  we  then known as varian associates  inc  announced our intention to spin off our instruments business and our semiconductor equipment business to our stockholders 
we later transferred our instruments business to varian inc  or vi  a wholly owned subsidiary  and transferred our semiconductor equipment business to varian semiconductor equipment associations  inc  or vsea  a wholly owned subsidiary 
we retained the medical systems business  principally the sales and service of oncology systems and the sales of x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
on april   we spun off vi and vsea to our common stockholders  which we refer to as the spin offs in this annual report on form k 
immediately after the spin offs  we changed our name to varian medical systems  inc or vms 
an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  and other agreements govern our ongoing relationships with vi and vsea 
we are a world leader in the design and manufacture of integrated systems of equipment and software for treating cancer with radiation therapy  as well as high quality  cost effective x ray tubes for original equipment manufacturers  replacement x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
our oncology systems business produces and sells a fully integrated system of products for treating cancer with radiation  including not only linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products but also information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated ancillary products and services 
our linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products are sold and are in service around the world 
our x ray products business manufactures and sells x ray tubes that cover a range of applications including computed tomography  or ct  scanning  radioscopic fluoroscopic imaging  special procedures and mammography and that are sold to most major diagnostic equipment manufacturers as well as directly to end users for replacement purposes 
we also manufacture and sell advanced brachytherapy products through ginzton technology center  or gtc  our research facility for identifying and addressing new and potential new markets 
our brachytherapy business  which was successfully incubated within gtc  is now ready to move into its next phase of development  and subsequent to september   we announced that the management for the brachytherapy business will now report directly to our chief executive officer  but their operations will still be reported as part of the other category of our industry segments  see note industry segments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
through gtc  we are also pursuing other potential new business areas  including next generation digital x ray imaging technology  digital x ray fluoroscopic imagers and the potential of combining advances in focused energy and imaging technology with the latest breakthroughs in biotechnology 
in addition  we are pursuing technologies and products that promise to improve disease management by employing targeted energy to enhance the effectiveness of molecular medicine 
on november   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
the distribution of the shares was made on january  to stockholders of record as of december  unless otherwise stated  all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the split 
in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year as a result of sab and the associated sec guidance  we changed our revenue recognition accounting policy for our linear accelerators and related hardware products in the oncology systems business and three brachytherapy hardware products  which collectively represented approximately half of our annual revenue in the last fiscal year 
sales of these products generally include the provision for installation and related obligations 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized revenue for these products upon transfer of risk of loss for products to customers  which typically coincided with shipment of products and preceded installation and customer acceptance because acceptance was deemed probable 
subsequent to the adoption of sab  our accounting policy is to defer revenue recognition on these products on the greater of the fair value of the 
table of contents installation services or the amount of payment that is contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause 
in conjunction with this change in accounting policy  we recognized an after tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  representing the cumulative effect on prior years of the application of sab prior periods have not been restated 
pro forma sales  gross profit  net earnings and net earnings per share assuming that the new policy had been retrospectively applied to prior years are provided under note adoption of sab of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  or sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas effective september  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
we completed the required annual impairment test and determined that there is no impairment to our recorded goodwill balances 
had we been accounting for goodwill under sfas for all fiscal years presented  our earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  net earnings and earnings per share  basic and diluted would have been as follows in millions  except per share amounts fiscal years reported earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes adjusted net earnings net earnings per share basic reported earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles goodwill amortization  net of tax cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes adjusted net earnings per share basic net earnings per share diluted reported earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles goodwill amortization  net of tax cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes adjusted net earnings per share diluted on july   we acquired the hdr  or high dose rate  brachytherapy business of mds nordion  a division of mds canada  inc  for approximately million in cash 
in january  we acquired argus software for million in cash 

table of contents this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this report  as well as the information contained under factors affecting our business below 
we discuss our results of continuing operations below 
all figures given in this annual report on form k are based on actual reported results  unless otherwise stated as being on a pro forma basis assuming that sab was applied retroactively to prior years 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based on our financial statements which we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business  see factors affecting our business included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the accounting policies which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in general  for hardware products which include obligations for installation  our policy is to recognize the amount earned upon transfer of risk of loss and defer revenue recognition on the greater of the fair value of the installation services or the amount of payment that is contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause 
for amounts deferred  revenue is recognized upon completion or satisfaction of remaining obligations 
sab has no impact on our revenue recognition policies related to sales of software products or products in the x ray products business 
revenue for product sales in the x ray products business is recognized when title to the product transfers to the customer because these products do not include any installation obligations 
sales for software products are generally recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare part sales in the oncology service business is generally recognized when title to the product transfers to the customer 
revenue related to services performed on a time and materials basis is recognized when it is earned and billable 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the related contract 
revenue is dependent on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and readiness 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or the products are not accepted by the customer  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require a small portion upon signing of the purchase order contract  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and a small portion upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we 
table of contents evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional provisions which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of september   our provisions for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
warranty obligations we generally warrant our products for a specific period of time against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts  which fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
impairment of goodwill we adopted sfas during the first quarter of fiscal year this statement requires us to make an initial assessment within the first six months of adoption and then annual assessments thereafter as to the carrying value of the goodwill 
during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we determined that the fair value of the reporting units  which are the industry segments as described in note industry segments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  exceeded the carrying value and thus did not need to record an impairment charge 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 
as of september   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs of these assessments or remedial efforts can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and the aicpa s statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
the accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be incurred 
on a quarterly basis  we review these accrued balances 
if we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of million in fiscal year were higher than our sales of million in fiscal year growth in north american sales accounted for all of our sales growth in fiscal year international sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year product sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year for fiscal year  we expect total sales to grow in the low teens percentile over fiscal year  due primarily to expected continued growth in oncology systems and expected modest growth levels in x ray products

table of contents oncology systems sales total sales for the oncology systems business increased to million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year oncology systems product sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts and service to customers billed on a time and materials basis  increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year international sales for fiscal year were slightly below fiscal year sales due primarily to an usually large shipment to brazil completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as well as the timing of shipments as a result of customer requested delivery schedules and treatment room completion 
north american sales in fiscal year increased over fiscal year levels by primarily due to the continued increase in demand for intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt  and imrt related products 
x ray products sales total x ray products sales decreased to million of total sales in fiscal year compared to million of total sales for fiscal year however  sales rose slightly in the second half of fiscal year when compared to the same period in fiscal year the decline in sales in the first half of fiscal year was the result of excess inventory levels at our largest japanese oem customer and a decline in the core oem medical x ray tube business in the last two years 
we believe that there is a continuing consolidation in the oem markets  including the acquisition of previous customers by companies that also manufacture competing x ray tube products 
however  we believe that we will achieve modest growth levels in fiscal year due to growth opportunities in our amorphous silicon flat panel imagers for diagnostic and imaging systems and in our industrial tubes for baggage screening 
gtc sales gtc sales were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts  service to customers billed on a time and materials basis and research contracts  were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the net increase in total gtc sales stemmed primarily from higher payments under research contracts and growth in our brachytherapy treatment planning software business  as well as the addition of sales in the gammamed product line  which we acquired in july gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of total sales  gross profit was in fiscal year and in fiscal year product gross profit was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in product sales in fiscal year resulted primarily from proportionately greater north american sales as well as increased sales of ancillary products  both of which have traditionally higher margins 
gross profit for service contracts and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in service contracts and other sales resulted primarily from increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales of oncology systems increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year due principally to the proportionately greater north american sales and increased sales of ancillary products 
however  gross profit as a percentage of sales in our x ray products 
table of contents business decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the gross profit decrease in x ray products stemmed primarily from the decline in sales volume 
for fiscal year  we expect gross profit as a percentage of sales for the total company to be at approximately the same level as fiscal year we anticipate that the geographical mix will remain similar in fiscal year as for fiscal year research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing of sales in both years 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in fiscal year occurred in all businesses 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to expenses related to the higher volume of sales  as well as  higher corporate costs for insurance  inclusions of expenses from our recent acquisition and hedging losses related to hedges of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in compliance with sfas reorganization income costs  net the million of net reorganization income in fiscal year resulted from the release of a reorganization accrual for foreign taxes excluding income taxes established as part of the spin offs  partially offset by reorganization charges primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the amounts previously accrued 
interest income expense  net net interest income was million for fiscal year compared to million of net interest income for fiscal year the decrease was primarily a result of lower interest rates and our investing in tax exempt municipal securities to lower our effective tax rate partially offset by increased levels of cash and marketable securities 
other non operating expense we wrote off our million investment in dpix llc  or dpix  which supplies us with amorphous silicon based thin film transistor arrays  or flat panels  for our digital imaging subsystems and portalvision imaging systems  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on the belief that this investment is other than temporarily impaired 
although we have recorded this accounting impairment charge in fiscal year  we will continue to participate in the dpix consortium and dpix continues to supply us with flat panels 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this decline is primarily due to tax exemptions available for our investments in municipal securities 
in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income exclusion  research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest and foreign taxes 
for fiscal year  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax earnings  research and development credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes we recorded a net charge of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles resulting from the adoption of sab and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  in fiscal year the cumulative effect of accounting change applicable to sab amounted to million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share 
this amount is primarily comprised of the portion of revenue  the payment of which was contractually linked to the acceptance clause  and related profits associated with equipment that was shipped and previously recorded as revenue but for which installation and or acceptance did not occur until after fiscal year approximately million of the million of revenue deferred as of the beginning of fiscal year was recognized in upon installation and or acceptance 
approximately million of fiscal year and prior years equipment shipments was deferred as of september  
table of contents  of which approximately million was recognized as revenue in fiscal year the million charge related to sab was partially offset by a million credit to earnings resulting from the adoption of sfas  in the first quarter of fiscal year for a discussion of sab and sfas  see note adoption of sab and note derivatives instruments and hedging activities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  respectively 
earnings per diluted share earnings per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year earnings per diluted share in fiscal year included the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles resulting from the adoption of sab and sfas  as well as the write off of our investment in dpix 
the increase can also be attributed to the increase in operations compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we expect earnings per diluted share to increase by about over fiscal year results 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of million under the new sab basis in fiscal year were higher than our reported sales of million under the historical accounting basis in fiscal year international sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to the reported million of sales in fiscal year product sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year due to the accounting change related to sab made in fiscal year  it is more meaningful to compare our sales results under the same comparative accounting basis 
fiscal year pro forma sales  applying sab  were million  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  sales increased year over year 
the adoption sab resulted in million of sales being deferred at the end of fiscal year  primarily representing the portion of the revenue that was contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause applicable to related products that were shipped and not yet installed and or accepted at september  of the million of sales we deferred at the end of fiscal year  we recognized million as sales in fiscal year upon installation and or acceptance

north american sales increased in fiscal year over fiscal year levels to a lesser extent relative to the growth in international sales  primarily because of the high growth rate in the volume of north american shipments made in the prior fiscal year 
continued demand for imrt and imrt related products in the us drove the growth in north american sales 
fiscal year pro forma sales  applying sab  were million of sales  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  oncology systems sales increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year sab changes resulted in million of revenue being deferred at september  primarily representing the portion of the revenue that was contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause applicable to related products that were shipped and not yet installed and or accepted at september  x ray products sales total x ray products sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased sales of our glass tube products in the us  partially offset by decreases of our high end ct scanner tubes sales

gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit was in both fiscal year and fiscal year product gross profit was in both fiscal year and fiscal year gross profit for service and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in service and other sales stemmed primarily from increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the oncology systems business was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this margin increase resulted primarily from increased sales volume and higher margins in ancillary products  which more than offset the geographical mix shift toward international sales  which typically have lower margins 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the x ray products business decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline stemmed primarily from a sales mix shift toward lower margin glass tube products

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  purchases of business assets and funding of continuing operations 
our sources of cash include sales  net interest income and borrowings under short term notes payable and long term loans 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
at september   we had million of long term loans and million of short term notes payable 
interest rates on the outstanding long term loans on this date range from to with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
as of september   the weighted average interest rate on the short term notes payable was 
the long term loans currently contain covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments 
the covenants also require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results 
at september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximately of which was held abroad and would be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the us total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million from million at september  
table of contents our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  compared to generating net cash of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
a major contributor was our increase in net earnings to million in fiscal year from million before the non cash cumulative adjustments related to the changes in accounting principles applicable to sab and sfas in fiscal year and from million in fiscal year the tax benefit from stock options was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year in addition to the increases in tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and net earnings  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year related primarily to million in other net non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  write offs and others and million increase in accrued expenses  product warranty and advance payments from customers excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on cash  partially offset by additions to inventory and other current assets of million 
the primary difference between our fiscal year and fiscal year net cash from operating activities resulted from the increase in the tax benefit from stock options to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and the increase in net earnings from fiscal year to fiscal year investing activities used million of net cash in fiscal year  compared to using million and million of net cash in fiscal years and  respectively 
the net cash used in fiscal year was primarily used for purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of two businesses of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
in fiscal years and  the net cash used was primarily used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million and million  respectively 
financing activities used net cash of million and million in fiscal year and  respectively  compared to providing net cash of million in fiscal year net cash used by financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of million used in repurchases of common stock offset by million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  partially offset by million used in purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of million used to pay down short term debt 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
total debt as a percentage of total capital improved to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end largely due to the increase of our stockholders equity during fiscal year the ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined to to at fiscal year end from to at fiscal year end due primarily to our investment in long term marketable securities 
at fiscal year end  we had million available in unused uncommitted lines of credit 
we expect our capital expenditures to be between of sales in fiscal year our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the us and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate positively and negatively as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash to be generated from operations and our borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year 
table of contents the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions thereafter operating leases notes payable long term debt total stock repurchase program on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase by us of up to two million shares of our common stock on a post split basis over the following twelve month period 
the stock repurchase program was approved in an effort to enhance stockholder value 
during fiscal year  we paid million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
the time period for the repurchase was extended by our board of directors to expire on february  during fiscal year  we paid million to repurchase  shares of our common stock under this program 
all shares that have been repurchased have been retired 
as of september   we can still purchase up to  shares under this program on a post split basis 
deferred stock compensation during fiscal year  we granted  restricted performance shares to several of our senior executives and  shares of restricted common stock to a senior executive under our omnibus stock plan and our stock option plan 
the restricted performance shares will vest five years from the date of grant subject to the employees having satisfied defined performance objectives 
upon vesting  we will deliver one share of our common stock for each performance share granted to the employee 
we measure deferred stock compensation for both the restricted performance shares and the restricted common stock based on the stock s fair value on the date of grant and we amortize the deferred stock compensation over the stocks respective vesting periods 
in connection with these grants  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
for fiscal years and  we recognized in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of deferred stock compensation of million and million  respectively 
we estimate that we will amortize the remaining deferred compensation of approximately million at september  as follows million during each of fiscal years through  and million during fiscal year the amount of deferred compensation expense recorded and to be recorded in future periods could decrease if the restricted awards for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
legal proceedings we are a party to three related federal legal actions involving claims by independent service organizations  or isos  that our policies and business practices relating to replacement parts violate the antitrust laws 
isos purchase replacement parts from us and compete with us in servicing the linear accelerators we manufacture 
in response to several threats of litigation regarding the legality of our parts policy  we filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the northern district of california in asking for a determination that our then new policies are legal and enforceable and damages against two of the isos for copyright infringement and related claims 
later  four defendants filed separate claims in other jurisdictions raising issues allegedly related to those in the declaratory relief action and seeking injunctive relief and damages against us for million for each plaintiff 
we defeated the defendants motion for a preliminary injunction in us district court in texas about our policies 
the isos defendants amended the complaint to include class action allegations  alleged a variety of other anti competitive business practices and filed a motion for class certification  which was denied by the us district court in texas on september  
table of contents the parties consolidated claims from the northern district of california with the action in the us district court in texas 
after the spin offs  we retained the liabilities related to the medical systems business before the spin offs  including the isos litigation 
in addition  under the agreement governing the spin offs  we agreed to manage and defend liabilities related to legal proceedings and environmental matters arising from corporate or discontinued operations 
each of vi and vsea must generally indemnify us for one third of these liabilities after adjusting for any insurance proceeds we realize or tax benefits we receive  including specified environmental related liabilities described below  and to fully assume and indemnify us for liabilities arising from each of their operations before the spin offs 
for a discussion of environmental matters  see environmental matters below 
from time to time  we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
while we cannot be certain about the ultimate outcome of any litigation  management does not believe any pending legal proceeding will result in a judgment or settlement that will have a material adverse effect on our business 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations 
for example  several countries are proposing to require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment s useful life 
the eu has some proposed directives that may require medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life and to be unable to use some hazardous substances in products sold in the eu 
as the directives are currently drafted  effective in  products sold in the eu could not contain listed dangerous substances  and product collection programs would have to be in place within months of adoption of these rules in each eu state 
in addition  the proposed directives may require that  beginning in  we establish an agreement with our european customers at the time of sale of medical equipment for the recovery and environmentally sound disposal of the medical equipment or any of its components 
we may also be required to identify the locations of dangerous substances in our medical equipment so we  or if the product is sent to a recovery facility  that facility  can remove these components  such as mercury switches  batteries  printed circuit boards  before product recycling or disposal 
we may also be required to provide up front financial guarantees when placing products on the market 
if approved  each member of the eu must set its own regulations to implement the directives  which may vary 
these directives  if approved  would create increased costs for our operations 
from the time we began operating  we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations  if any  existing at the time 
we also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations 
under various laws  such as the federal superfund law  and under our obligations concerning operations before the spin offs  we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects from our pre spun off operations and as applicable reimbursing third parties such as the us environmental protection agency or other responsible parties  for cleanup activities 
under the terms of the agreement governing the distribution  vi and vsea are each obligated to indemnify us for one third of these environmental cleanup costs  after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us 
the cleanup projects we are overseeing are being conducted under the direction of or in consultation with relevant regulatory agencies 
we estimate these cleanup projects will take up to years to complete 
as described below  we have accrued a total of million at september  to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects we have developed a range of potential costs covering a variety of cleanup activities  including three cleanup projects  reimbursements to third parties  project management costs and legal costs 
there are  
table of contents however  various uncertainties in these estimates that make it difficult to develop a best estimate 
our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup activities ranges from million to million 
for these estimates  we have not discounted the costs to present dollars because of the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate and have accrued million  which is the amount at the low end of the range 
for eight cleanup projects  we have sufficient knowledge to develop better estimates of our future costs 
while our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup projects  including third party claims  ranges from million to million  our best estimate within that range is million 
for these projects we have accrued million  which is our best estimate of the million discounted to present dollars at  net of inflation 
at september   our reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date  was calculated as follows total recurring non recurring anticipated costs costs future costs dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount when we developed the estimates above  we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties 
these amounts are  however  only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects 
we may also spend more or less than these estimates 
based on current information  we believe that our reserves are adequate 
at this time  management believes that it is remote that any single environmental event would have a materially adverse impact on our cash flows in any single fiscal year 
we spent million  million and million  net of amounts borne by vi and vsea  during fiscal year  and  respectively  on environmental investigation  cleanup and third party claim costs 
we received cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from various insurance companies  defendants and other third parties in     and in addition  we have an agreement with an insurance company to pay a portion of our past and future expenditures 
as a result of this agreement  we have a million receivable included in other assets as of september  we believe that this receivable is collectible because it is based on a binding  written settlement agreement with a financially viable insurance company 
our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  these facilities have used substances which are or might be considered hazardous  and we have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict 

table of contents other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for listing the non audit services  approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year by our audit committee  to be performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our external auditor

table of contents factors affecting our business the following factors  in conjunction with the other information included in this form k  should be carefully considered 
if we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation  our products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer the marketplace for our products is characterized by rapid change and technological innovation 
because our products often have long development and government approval cycles  we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation 
for example  most of our recent product introductions in our oncology systems business have related to a relatively new technology called intensity modulated radiation therapy  or imrt  which is a form of three dimensional conformal radiation therapy that links treatment planning  information management and driver software to the actual treatment delivery device  the linear accelerator 
while we believe that the radiation oncology market will widely adopt imrt and imrt products  if future studies fail to confirm the effectiveness of imrt or our products or show negative side effects  if other more effective technologies are introduced  or if for other reasons this does not occur  our sales could fail to increase or could decrease 
our success will depend upon the continued growth in awareness  acceptance and success of imrt in general and acceptance of our products utilizing this technology in particular 
in addition  as more institutions purchase imrt equipped linear accelerators or upgrade their existing accelerators with imrt technology  the market for imrt related products may eventually become saturated  and our future success will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate and capitalize on future technological changes such as imrt 
we may be unable to accurately anticipate changes in our markets and the direction of technological innovation  our competitors may develop improved products or processes  or the marketplace may conclude that the task our product was designed to do is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
if this occurs  the market for our products may be adversely affected and they may become less useful or obsolete 
any development adversely affecting the market for our equipment would result in us having to reduce production volumes or to discontinue manufacturing and would reduce our revenues 
if we are unable to develop new generations of products and enhancements to existing products  we may be unable to attract or retain customers our success is dependent upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new generations of products and enhancements to existing products 
our products are technologically complex and must keep pace with rapid and significant technological change  comply with rapidly evolving industry standards and compete effectively with new product introductions of our competitors 
accordingly  many of our products require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require significant capital commitments and investments on our part  which we may be unable to recover 
in addition  some of our research and development projects are funded by government contracts 
changes in government priorities and our ability to attract such funding may affect our overall research effort and ultimately  our ability to develop successful new products and product enhancements 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and the associated costs  are also affected by our ability to properly identify customer needs  prove feasibility of new products  limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals  
table of contents accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase in of new products and phase out of old products  price our products competitively  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance of the products  manage customer acceptance and payment for products  limit customer demands for retrofits of both new and old products  and anticipate and compete successfully with competitors efforts 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture and phase in new products or product enhancements 
without the successful introduction of new products and product enhancements  we may be unable to attract and retain customers and our revenue and operating results will suffer 
in addition  even if customers accept new products or product enhancements  the revenues from such products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making such products available to customers 
we face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of our products  and if we fail or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approvals or fail to comply with applicable regulations  we may be unable to distribute our products or may be subject to civil or criminal penalties we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation of the manufacture and distribution of our products  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming  and changes to or failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or adoption of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect our business 
in the united states  our products  research and development activities  and marketing and manufacturing practices and those of some of our suppliers are subject to regulation by the fda  pursuant to the fdc act 
our products are regulated under the fdc act as medical devices  and as such generally require fda k pre market notification clearance or and approved pre market approval application  or pma  before we can take orders or distribute products in the united states 
in addition  modifications or enhancements to these products that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness  or constitute a major change in intended use  require further fda clearance or approval 
obtaining fda market clearances or approvals can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
we may fail to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so 
furthermore  even if we are granted regulatory clearances  the clearances may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product  which may limit the market for those products 
the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products  which may delay or hinder a product s timely entry into the marketplace 
if we were unable to achieve required fda approval or clearance for a product  or were limited or unduly delayed in doing so  our business would suffer 
in addition  we have generally been able to use the k pre market notification clearance for our products  which is less time consuming  expensive and uncertain than the pma approval process 
if we were required to use the pma approval process for future products or product modifications  it could delay or prevent release of the proposed products or modifications  and could cause our business to suffer 
in addition to fda required market clearances and approvals  our manufacturing operations are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which addresses the quality program requirements  such as manufacturing  design  controls  methods  facilities and quality assurance controls used in manufacturing  assembly  packing  storing and installing medical devices 
compliance with the qsr is necessary to receive fda clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for us to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings 
the fda makes announced and unannounced 
table of contents inspections to determine compliance with the qsr s and may issue us reports listing instances where we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and or procedures or warning letters which  if not adequately responded to  could lead to enforcement actions against us  including fines and the total shutdown of our production facilities 
inspections usually occur every two years 
our last inspection occurred in september the fda and the ftc also regulate the promotion and advertising of our products that are medical devices 
the fda and ftc determinations on these matters can be subjective  and we cannot assure you that the fda or ftc would agree that all or our promotional claims are permissible 
if the fda or ftc determined that any of our promotional claims were not permissible  we may be required to revise our promotional claims or may be subject to enforcement actions 
as a manufacturer of radiation producing devices  as well as devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to their manufacture  distribution  transportation  import export  possession  use and disposal 
our radiation producing medical devices are subject to the fda clearance and approval requirements  and the manufacture and sale of these products are subject to state regulation that is extensive and varies from state to state 
our manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing byproduct material also requires us to obtain a number of license and certifications for these devices and materials 
service of these products must also be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license 
we are also subject to a variety of additional environmental laws regulating our manufacturing operations and the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials  and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  we are also subject to extensive laws and regulations in addition to fda regulation on a broad array of additional subjects at the federal  state and local levels 
these include laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information fraud and abuse laws and regulations such as physician self referral prohibitions  anti kickback laws  and false claims laws 
we also must comply with numerous federal  state and local laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices and fire hazard control 
if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  it can result in a wide variety of actions against us  such as investigations  reports of non compliance or warning letters  fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  partial suspensions or total shutdown of production  or the imposition of operating restrictions  losses of clearances or approvals already granted  or the refusal of future requests for clearance or approval  seizures or recalls of our products  the inability to sell our products in the applicable jurisdiction  and criminal prosecutions 
government regulation also may delay for a considerable period of time or prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services that we may develop  and or impose costly requirements on our business 
in addition  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could affect the timing of  or prevent us from obtaining  future regulatory approvals  or could otherwise adversely affect our business 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country  and may differ significantly from those in the united states 
in general  our products are regulated outside the united states as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and the ftc 
we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of medical devices  radiation producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials  and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection  safe working conditions  manufacturing 
table of contents practices and other matters  in each case that are often comparable  if not more stringent  than regulation in the united states 
our sales of products in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  environmental and product recycling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
we rely in some countries on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with foreign regulatory requirements 
we may be required to incur significant time and expense in obtaining and maintaining non us regulatory approvals and in complying with non us laws and regulations 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously obtained approvals or failure to comply with existing of future regulatory requirements could restrict or prevent us from doing business in the applicable country or subject us to a variety of enforcement actions  which would adversely affect our business 
it is also important that our products comply with electrical safety and environmental standards  such as those of underwriters laboratories  or ul  the canadian standards association  or csa  and the international electrotechnical commission  or iec 
if one or more of our products fail to comply with these standards  we may be unable to obtain or maintain registrations to sell our products  demand for our products may diminish  or we may be subject to other enforcement actions 
the laws and regulations applicable to us and our business and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change  and we cannot predict what effect  if any  changes may have on our business 
in addition  new laws and regulations may be adopted which adversely affect our business 
there has been a trend in recent years  both in the united states and abroad  toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers 
the continuing trend of more stringent regulatory oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities may cause medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty  greater risk and higher expenses 
a further discussion of government regulation of our industry and our products may be found in part i  item of this form k  business government regulation 
health care reforms and changes to third party reimbursements for radiation oncology services may affect demand for our products the us government has in the past  and may in the future  consider and state and local as well as a number of foreign governments are considering or have adopted health care policies intended to curb rising health care costs 
these policies include rationing of government funded reimbursement for health care services and imposing price controls on medical products and services providers 
significant changes in the health care systems in the united states or elsewhere would likely have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services and the way we conduct business 
we are unable to predict what health care reform legislation or regulation  if any  will be enacted in the united states or elsewhere  whether other health care legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future  or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
in addition  sales of some of our products indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available to our customers for the treatment provided by those products from third party health care payors  such as government health care insurance programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs  private insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
once medicare has made a decision to provide reimbursement for a given treatment  these reimbursement rates are generally reviewed and adjusted by medicare annually 
private third party payors often adopt medicare reimbursement policies and payment amounts 
as a result  decisions by medicare to reimburse for a treatment  or changes to medicare s reimbursement policies or reductions in payment amounts with respect to a treatment would likely extend to third party payor reimbursement policies and amounts for that treatment as well 
the availability of such reimbursement for treatments using our products and the relevant reimbursement rates can affect our customers decisions to purchase our products 
for example  currently medicare reimbursement rates for imrt treatments are substantially higher than the reimbursement rates for standard radiotherapy treatments  and recent growth in our business has been driven by growth in sales of imrt and imrt related products 
any adverse change in medicare s reimbursement policies regarding imrt treatments or other procedures 
table of contents using our products  or material reduction in reimbursement rates for such procedures  could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
in addition  the executive branch of the federal government and the congress from time to time consider various medicare and other health care reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for health care services 
if a proposal that significantly reduced reimbursement for our products or procedures using our products were enacted into law  it could adversely affect the demand for these products and our business would suffer 
as a general matter  third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical procedures or limiting or prohibiting reimbursement for specific services or devices or through other means  and we cannot be sure that they will reimburse our customers at levels sufficient to enable us to achieve or maintain sales and price levels for our products 
without adequate support from third party payors  the market for our products may be limited 
there is no uniform policy on reimbursement among third party payors  nor can we be sure that procedures using our products will qualify for reimbursement from third party payors 
for example  we have been informed that some third party payors regard imrt as investigational or experimental and do not provide reimbursement for these services at this time 
foreign countries also have their own health care reimbursement systems  and we cannot be sure that third party reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system 
a further discussion of health care reforms and government funded reimbursement for health care products and services such as ours may be found in part i  item of this form k  business government regulation 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation and diagnostic imaging of the human body and are subject to extensive regulation  product defects may result in material product liability claims  investigation by regulatory authorities or product recalls that could harm future sales and require us to pay material uninsured claims our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation to the human body or are involved in diagnostic imaging of the human body  the possibility for significant injury and or death exists 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture  or use of our products may be small or nonexistent 
as such  we may face substantial liability to patients for damages resulting from the faulty design  manufacture and servicing of our products 
we may also face liability due to claims arising out of potential past and future product defects and personal injury matters related to the general electric radiotherapy service business that we purchased in december and for which we have assumed liability 
we may also be subject to claims for property damages related to any errors or defects in our products 
in addition  if a product we designed or manufactured is defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  improper use of the product or other reasons  we may be required to notify regulatory authorities and or to recall the product  possibly at our expense 
a required notification to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of our products  which could in turn result in required recalls  restrictions on the sale of the products or other civil or criminal penalties 
the adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
these investigations or recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in our incurring substantial costs  losing revenues and loss of reputation  each of which would harm our business 
we have historically maintained limited product liability insurance coverage in an amount we deem sufficient for each of our businesses 
these product liability insurance policies are expensive and have deductible amounts and self insured retentions 
in the future  these policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts  if at all 
in addition  the insurance coverage we have obtained may not be adequate 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited and for which indemnification is not available would require us to pay such uncovered amounts  which could be substantial 

table of contents the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may lose market share to companies with greater resources or who are able to develop more effective technologies  or we could be forced to reduce our prices the radiation therapy equipment and software markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
our products and services compete with those of a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies  some with greater resources  financial or otherwise  than we have  and the rapid technological changes occurring in our markets are expected to lead to the entry of new competitors 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to commercialize new products ahead of our competitors 
in our sales of linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products  we compete primarily with siemens  elekta  nucletron and mitsubishi 
we compete with a variety of companies  such as impac medical systems  inc  philips  cms  nomos  mds nordion  nucletron and elekta  in our software systems and accessories business and in our brachytherapy business  we compete primarily with nucletron 
for the service and maintenance business for our products  we compete with independent service organizations and our customers internal service organizations 
the market place for x ray tube products is also extremely competitive 
all of the major diagnostic imaging systems companies  which are the primary customers of our x ray products business  also manufacture x ray tubes for use in their own products 
we must compete with these in house x ray tube manufacturing operations that are naturally favored by their parent companies 
as a result  we must have a competitive advantage in one or more significant areas  which may include lower product cost  better product quality or superior technology 
we sell a significant volume of our x ray tube products to companies such as toshiba corporation  hitachi medical corporation  shimadzu corporation  philips medical systems and ge medical systems  all of which have in house x ray tube production capability 
in addition  we compete against other stand alone x ray tube manufacturers such as comet ag and iae industria applicazioni elettroniche spa 
in each of our market segments  existing competitors actions and new entrants may have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we currently use or market or that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  the timing of competitors introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products 
if we are unable to develop competitive products  gain regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of such products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors  market acceptance of our products may be limited and our sales reduced 
in addition  some of our competitors could be acquired  as is happening currently with some smaller competitors in the x ray tube market  which could give them added financial strength and enable them to compete more aggressively 
some of our suppliers or distributors could also be acquired by competitors  which could disrupt these supply or distribution arrangements 
a further discussion of competition in our markets may be found in part i  item of this form k  business competition 
we may incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property  and if we are not able to do so  our competitive position would be harmed we place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent  copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace 
we file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes 
we cannot be sure  however  that patents now owned or patents that will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by  or licensed to  vms  or that the claims allowed under any issued patents  will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology position against competitors 
issued patents owned by  or licensed to  vms may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or the rights granted under the patent may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we have to assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome to any such litigation 
table of contents could harm us 
in addition  we may not be able to detect infringement or may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
we also rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other laws  and contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title  including confidentiality agreements with vendors  strategic partners  co developers  employees  consultants and other third parties  to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that such protections will prove adequate and that contractual agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breaches  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we cannot assure you that our trademarks will not be used by unauthorized third parties 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
if we were to lose the rights to license this technology  or our costs to license the technology were to materially increase  our business would suffer 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products the industries in which we compete are characterized by a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights 
our competitors  like companies in many high technology businesses  continually review other companies products for possible conflicts with their own intellectual property rights 
determining whether a product infringes a third party s intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues  and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may not be aware of intellectual property rights of others that relate to our products  services or technologies 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights relating to their products 
such claims are often  but not always  settled by mutual agreement satisfactorily without litigation 
any contest regarding patents or other intellectual property could by costly and time consuming  and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such contest 
if we are unsuccessful  we may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of our products  or may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
we cannot assure you that any licenses required would be made available on acceptable terms or at all 
since we depend upon a limited group of suppliers  and in some cases sole source suppliers  for some product components  the loss of a supplier could reduce our ability to manufacture products  cause material delays in our ability to deliver products  or significantly increase our costs we obtain some of the components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases a single source supplier  for example  the source wires for high dose afterloaders  klystrons for linear accelerators  imaging panels  non coated array sensors and coating for array sensors for the flat panels  specialized integrated circuits for imaging subassemblies  and some targets  housings and glass bulbs for x ray tubes 
if we lose any of these suppliers including any single source supplier  we would be required to obtain one or more replacement suppliers and may be required to conduct a significant level of product development to incorporate new parts into our products 
we believe that we may be able to obtain alternative sources for such components when necessary  although the need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause material delays in delivery or significantly increase costs 
although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss  there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
disruptions or loss of any of our limited or sole source components or subassemblies  including the ones referenced above  could adversely affect our business and financial results and could result in damage to customer relationships 

table of contents if we are unable to provide the significant education and training required for the health care market to accept our products  our business will suffer in order to achieve market acceptance for our products  we are often required to educate physicians about the use of a new procedure  overcome physician objections to some of the effects of the product or its related treatment regimen and convince health care payors that the benefits of the product and its related treatment regimen outweigh its costs 
for example  the complexity and dynamic nature of imrt requires significant education of hospitals and physicians regarding the benefits of imrt and the required departures from customary practices 
we have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of imrt generally and to encourage acceptance and adoption of our imrt related products 
the timing of our competitors introduction of products and the market acceptance of their products may also make this educational process more difficult 
we cannot be sure that any products we develop will gain any significant market acceptance and market share among physicians  patients and health care payors  even if required regulatory approvals are obtained 
the nature of our business exposes us to environmental claims or cleanup expenses  which could cause us to pay significant amounts we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in environmental laws and regulations or new laws or regulations 
for example  several countries  including those in the european union  are proposing to require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment s useful life 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for a further discussion of environmental matters relating to our business  see environmental matters 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our business if we are not able to retain  hire and integrate sufficient qualified personnel our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of members of our key executive  technical  sales  marketing and engineering staff 
it also depends on our ability to attract  expand  integrate train and retain our management team  qualified engineering personnel and technical personnel 
the loss of services of key employees could adversely affect our business 
competition for such personnel can be intense 
we compete for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers and technology companies  as well as universities and research institutions 
because the competition for qualified personnel is intense  costs related to compensation could increase significantly if supply decreases or demand increases 
if we are unable to hire  train or retain qualified personnel  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
a high percentage of our sales are international  and economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales or make them less predictable we conduct business globally 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  we must provide significant service and support on a worldwide basis  and we have sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia  latin america and australia 
in addition  we have manufacturing and research operations in england  germany  switzerland  finland and france 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to 
table of contents develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers 
we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets  although we cannot be sure we will able to compete successfully in the international market or meet the service and support needs of such customers 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including the difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through many foreign country s legal systems  the longer payment cycles associated with many foreign customers  the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  fluctuations in exchange rates  which may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  our ability to obtain us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in the political  regulatory  safety or economic conditions in a country or region  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates we sell our products internationally and are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through established policies and procedures that include the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have historically entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of operational sales orders and balance sheet exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in original maturity  and no forward exchange contract has an original maturity greater than one year 
at september   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million and to buy foreign currencies totaling million 
although we engage in hedging strategies that may offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the protection these strategies provide will be affected by the timing of transactions  the effectiveness of the hedges measured by how closely the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item  forecast volatility and the extent of movement of exchange rates 
if our hedging strategies are not effective in offsetting the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results may be harmed 
if we are not able to match our manufacturing capacity with demand for our products  our financial results may suffer as a manufacturer of medical devices with a long production cycle  we need to anticipate demand for our products in order to ensure adequate manufacturing capacity 
we cannot assure you that we will be successfully able to do so 
if our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decrease  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents we rely on a limited number of oem customers  many of whom are also our competitors  for some of our x ray tubes  and the loss or reduction in purchasing volume by one or more of these customers or the continued consolidation among oems in the x ray tube products market could reduce our sales of x ray tube products we rely on a limited number of original equipment manufacturer customers  many of whom are also our competitors  for our x ray computed tomography tubes 
the loss of  or reduction in purchasing volume by one or more of these customers would have a material adverse affect on our x ray tubes business 
the core oem medical x ray tube business has declined for the last two years 
we also have noticed a trend toward consolidation in the oem markets of our x ray tubes business over the past few years 
the ongoing consolidation of customers who purchase our x ray tube products  including the consolidation of these customers into companies that already manufacture x ray tubes  could result in less predictable and reduced sales of our x ray tubes products 
in addition  our oem customer s products  which use our tubes  could lose market share to competitive products or technologies 
we may attempt to acquire new businesses  products or technologies and  if we are unable successfully to complete these acquisitions  or to integrate acquired businesses  products  technology or employees  we may fail to realize expected benefits or harm our existing business our success will depend  in part  on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our core business in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
in some circumstances  we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies rather than internal development 
for example  in we acquired argus software  a quality assurance software company  and the hdr or high dose rate  brachytherapy business of mds nordion  a manufacturer of hdr brachytherapy afterloaders 
the identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult  time consuming and costly  and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions 
for example  in fiscal year we were unable to complete a proposed acquisition of impac medical systems  and recorded a one time charge for acquisition expenses of million 
we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations  products or technologies into our company  and the process could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
in addition  we may be unable to retain employees of acquired companies  or their customers  suppliers  distributors or other partners who are our competitors or who have relationships with our competitors 
consequently  we may not achieve anticipated benefits and could harm our existing business 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or expenses  any of which could harm our business 
we utilize distributors for a portion of our sales  the loss of which could harm our sales in the territory serviced by these distributors we have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products  principally in foreign countries 
if these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced  our sales and or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected 
interoperability of our products with one another and their compatibility of our products with third party products is becoming increasingly important  and if we are unable to make our products interoperate with one another or compatible with widely used third party products  sales of our products could decrease as radiation oncology treatment becomes more and more complex  our customers are increasingly concerned about the interoperability and compatibility of the various products they use in providing treatment to patients 
for example  our linear accelerators  treatment simulators  treatment verification products and treatment planning and information management software products are designed to interoperate with one 
table of contents another  and to be compatible with other widely used third party radiation oncology products 
obtaining and maintaining this interoperability and compatibility is costly and time consuming  and when third parties modify the design or functionality of their products  it can require us to modify our products to ensure compatibility 
in addition  our ability to obtain compatibility with third party products can be dependent on the third parties providing us with adequate information regarding their products 
these third parties are in many cases our competitors and accordingly the timing of their product changes  and of sharing relevant information with us  may be made to place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we could further be required to obtain additional regulatory clearances for any modification of our products 
it is also possible that  despite our best efforts  we might be unable to make our products interoperable or compatible with widely used third party products or might only be able to do so at a prohibitive expense  making our products more costly or less attractive to our customers 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile  which could cause losses to our stockholders we have and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our operating results 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to estimate revenues and operational results prior to the end of any quarter 
many of our products require significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  some of our sales are quite large in dollar amounts  and the timing of these sales could affect our quarterly earnings 
factors that may affect timing of these sales and adversely affect our quarterly operating results include delay in shipment due  for example  to unanticipated construction delays  cancellations by customers  natural disasters  port strikes or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  delay in the installation and or acceptance of a product  or an unexpected change in a customer s financial condition or ability to obtain financing 
furthermore  our quarterly operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors  including changes in our or our competitors pricing or discount levels  changes or anticipated changes in third party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products  seasonality of revenue  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products  timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us and by our competitors  disruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials  labor  product components or transportation services  and changes in the general economic conditions in the regions in which we do business 
because many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels and a high percentage of such expenses are fixed for the short term  a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues as the timing of such revenues is dependent upon completion of customer site preparation and construction  installation scheduling  customer capital budgeting and financing  appropriate regulatory authorizations and other factors 
accordingly  we cannot be sure if or when the orders will mature into revenue 
our operating results in one or more future periods may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 

table of contents we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various other bodies 
a change in interpretations of  or our application of  these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
for example  the sec issued sab  which we adopted in the fourth quarter effective for fiscal year and going forward  which resulted in our taking a one time after tax charge of million 
in addition  the adoption of sab has resulted in our deferring recognition of a portion of our revenue for many of our hardware products until installation and or customer acceptance of the product 
as a result  delays in installation and or acceptance of products  either by the customer or by us  will have a greater effect on our results of operations in a given period than in the past 
these revenue recognition policies also may make it more difficult to estimate revenues and operational results prior to the end of any period 
any of these factors may result in our operating results in a given period falling below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would almost certainly cause the price of our stock to decline 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters  power loss  strikes and other events beyond our control  which would adversely affect our business we conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing  administration and data processing at facilities located in the state of california and other seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes in the past  as well as other natural disasters 
we carry limited earthquake insurance on our facilities in seismically active areas for inventory only 
such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting our facilities  it could significantly disrupt our operations  delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair  rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities  which could be lengthy  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities 
in addition  our facilities  particularly in the state of california may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies 
such shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts  which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business 
in addition  our products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports  and any natural disaster  strike or other event blocking shipment from such ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm our business 
if the spin off of vi and vsea did not qualify as a tax free spin off  we could incur a significant tax liability we received a tax ruling from the internal revenue service  or the irs  in connection with the spin offs to the effect  among other things  that neither vms nor the holders of varian common stock would recognize a gain or loss as a result of the spin offs 
these rulings  while generally binding upon the irs  are subject to factual representations and assumptions 
if our factual representations and assumptions were incorrect in any material respect  this ruling would be jeopardized 
we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause our representations and assumptions to be untrue 
vms  vi and vsea have agreed to certain restrictions on their future actions to further assure that the spin offs will qualify as tax free 
if one or both of the april  spin offs failed to qualify as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  then we will recognize a gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock of the non qualifying company or companies and our adjusted tax basis in the stock 
if we were to recognize gain on one or both of the spin offs  this gain and the resulting tax liability likely would be very substantial 
the tax sharing agreement between vms  vsea and vi allocates responsibility for the possible corporate tax burden resulting from the spin offs 
each of the three companies is responsible for any corporate taxes resulting from the spin offs attributable to action taken or permitted by that entity or its affiliates after the spin offs 
if the spin offs are found to be taxable but none of vms  vi and vsea has done anything to cause the spin offs to be taxable  each company generally will be liable for one third of those taxes 

table of contents our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a take over and therefore limit the price of our common stock we have a stockholder rights plan which  under specific circumstances  would significantly dilute the equity interest in our company of a person or persons seeking to acquire control of our company without the prior approval of our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation also includes provisions that may make an acquisition of control of our company without the approval of our board of directors more difficult 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to two primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange as a global concern  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures related to non us dollar denominated sales and purchases throughout europe  asia and australia 
we have significant international transactions in foreign currencies and address related financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s economy  and adhere to a policy of hedging firmly committed sales orders 
these firmly committed foreign currency sales orders are hedged with forward exchange contracts 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the forward exchange contracts range from one to twelve months in original maturity 
as of september   we do not have any forward exchange contracts with an original maturity greater than one year 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units having us dollar functional currencies 
we enter into these monthly foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional value of sold forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  totaled million 
the notional value of purchased forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  totaled million 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
an adverse move in currency exchange rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar manner 
accordingly  we believe that our hedging strategy should yield no material net impact to our results of operations or cash flows 
fiscal year end notional notional value value unrealized fair sold purchased gain loss value dollars in millions australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro dollar japanese yen new zealand dollar norwegian krone swedish krona swiss franc thailand baht totals the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 

table of contents interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio includes highly liquid instruments in short term investments as well as a portion in long term investments 
we would consider additional debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk in our investment portfolio or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
the principal amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  totaled million with a related weighted average interest rate of 
our long term debt of million at september  carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in various installments over a ten year period  beginning in our short term notes payable to bank of million at september  carry a weighted average interest rate of the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and debt obligations 
fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate liabilities notes payable average interest rate long term debt average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents a portion of which was held abroad at september  and would be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated in the us and marketable securities approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our long term debt is estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases
