item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for a detailed discussion on this topic  refer to our opening comments at the beginning of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  activation fee revenues and related expense  revenue recognition of credit challenged customers  contract cancellation fees  inventory reserves  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting from the customers inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we provide additional allowances for economically challenged customers that have been granted limited credit and recognize the revenue only after the customer has made an initial payment 
if these credit challenged customers fail to make payments after making an initial payment  additional allowances may be required 
we recognize only a portion of contract cancellation fees billed to customers that disconnect service prior to fulfilling the contractual length of service as there is no assurance that all contract cancellation fees that are billed will be collected 
if the collections on contract cancellation fees be less than that recognized  additional allowances may be required 
we defer revenues collected for activation fees over the estimated life of the subscriber 
we also defer an activation expense in an amount equal to activation fee revenue and defer this expense in an amount equal to the activation fee revenue over the life of the subscriber 
if the estimated life of the subscriber increases or decreases  the amounts of deferred revenue and deferred expense will be adjusted over the revised estimated life of the subscribers 
we write down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
we accrue commissions and other costs related to national retailers based upon their sales to new subscribers 
the national retailers receive both commission and  because the handset is typically sold below cost  a reimbursement for the difference between the sales price and the cost 
depending on the level of sales and other factors  our estimates of the amounts accrued for commissions and other costs owed to such retailers may require modification of our previous estimates 
we rely on sprint pcs for much of our billing information and based upon the timing of that information  make certain assumptions that the information is accurate and that it is consistent with historical trends 
while we believe our basis for making such assumptions reasonable  actual results may vary from these estimates 
overview through our subsidiaries  louisiana unwired  llc and texas unwired  a louisiana general partnership  we provide wireless personal communication services  commonly referred to as pcs  in eastern texas  southern oklahoma  southern arkansas  significant portions of louisiana  alabama and mississippi  the florida panhandle and southern tennessee

we currently provide sprint pcs service to all of the geographical areas  known as basic trading areas  btas or markets  in our service area 
we have completed the initial network build out plan for our markets and have met the sprint pcs management agreement requirement of providing network coverage to of the resident population in our service area

as of december   we had approximately  cellular and  paging subscribers 
we have experienced significant competition in our cellular markets from digital technologies that has resulted in an erosion of our cellular and paging customer base 
in an effort to revitalize this part of our operation  we elected to enhance our cellular network to include tdma digital technology 
tdma is one of three digital technologies in the united states and each uses a different digital language to send calls 
several providers  such as at t wireless  dobson communications  centurytel and triton pcs  have chosen tdma 
in august  we completed the upgrade of our cellular network to include tdma digital and expanded service to our cellular subscribers to now include voice mail notification  caller identification and text messaging 
we anticipate this upgrade will make us more competitive and provide increased service and roaming capacity 
in october  we amended our management agreements with sprint pcs 
effective june  sprint pcs began providing billing and customer care services for new pcs subscribers added in certain markets where we had previously provided these services 
we migrated a substantial portion of our customer base to sprint pcs s billing and customer care platform in august and completed this process in january we plan to continue to perform network capacity monitoring and planning beyond that date 
as a part of the amendment  sprint pcs has also agreed to not change the reciprocal sprint roaming rate of per minute through december for sprint pcs subscribers 
we are now dependent on sprint pcs for the reporting of a significant portion of our pcs service and travel revenues and certain operating  selling and administrative expenses and are required to make estimates based upon this information 
we continue to work with sprint pcs to ensure the information is timely and accurate and that adjustments  if any  are recorded in the proper accounting period
