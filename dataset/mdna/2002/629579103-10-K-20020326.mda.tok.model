critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product discounts and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  product liabilities  restructuring  closed mine obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product liabilities the company provides for the estimated cost of personal and property damage relating to the company s products 
reserves are made for estimates of the costs for known claims and estimates of the costs of incidents that have occurred but a claim has not yet been reported to the company 
while the company engages in extensive product quality reviews and customer education programs  the company s product liability provision is affected by the number and magnitude of claims of alleged product related damage and the cost to defend those claims 
in addition  the provision for product liabilities is also affected by changes in assumptions for medical costs  inflation rates  trends in damages awarded by juries and estimates of the number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s product liability provision causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
closed mine obligations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bellaire corporation bellaire  is a non operating subsidiary with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations  primarily former eastern us underground mining operations 
these legacy liabilities include obligations for black lung and other retiree medical benefits  environmental clean up and obligations to the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund arising as a result of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of provisions made by bellaire for these liabilities include estimates of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire  health care trend rates  inflation rates  cost of ongoing environmental clean up  discount factors and legal costs to defend claims 
in addition  these liabilities can be influenced by judicial proceedings and changes in regulations made by government agencies 
the company continually monitors the regulatory climate which could influence these liabilities as well as its assumptions used to develop accruals for these liabilities 
changes in any of these factors could materially change the company s estimates for these closed mine obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when customer orders are completed and shipped 
reserves for discounts  returns and product warranties are maintained for anticipated future claims 
the accounting policies used to develop these product discounts  returns and warranties include item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data product discounts the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price competition  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or if competition was to increase  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
product returns based on the company s historical experience  a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as buyer remorse  duplicate gifts received  product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer which  subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and replacement component costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or replacement component costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowances the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be expensed in the period such determination was made

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data the north american coal corporation nacoal mines and markets lignite primarily as fuel for power providers 
the lignite is surface mined in north dakota  texas  louisiana and mississippi 
total coal reserves approximate billion tons  with billion tons committed to customers pursuant to long term contracts 
nacoal operates six wholly owned lignite mines the coteau properties company coteau  the falkirk mining company falkirk  the sabine mining company sabine  san miguel lignite mine san miguel  red river mining company red river and mississippi lignite mining company mlmc 
nacoal also provides dragline mining services florida dragline operations for a limerock quarry near miami  florida 
the operating results of coteau  falkirk and sabine are included in project mining subsidiaries 
the operating results of all other operations are included in other mining operations 
financial review nacoal s subsidiaries  coteau  falkirk and sabine  are termed project mining subsidiaries because they mine lignite for utility customers pursuant to long term contracts at a price based on actual cost plus an agreed pre tax profit per ton 
due to the cost plus nature of these contracts  revenues and operating profits are affected by increases and decreases in operating costs  as well as by tons sold 
net income of these project mines  however  is not significantly affected by changes in such operating costs  which include costs of operations  interest expense and certain other items 
because of the nature of the contracts at these three mines  operating results for nacoal are best analyzed in terms of lignite tons sold  income before taxes and net income 
during  mlmc continued development of the mine area  but has been able to deliver lignite to its customer throughout the year 
mlmc delivered  for testing purposes  a relatively small amount of lignite to its customer s power plant in as of december   the customer s power plant  however  had not yet reached commercial operations date cod  as defined in the lignite sales agreement 
as a result  mlmc has been receiving monthly liquidated damages payments  as provided in the lignite sales agreement since january subsequent to december   the company was notified that mlmc s customer declared cod on march  mlmc does not expect to continue to receive liquidated damages payments related to the ongoing operations of the mine upon confirmation of cod 
in addition  during the first few months after cod  the plant may not be able to take the anticipated annual full production level of million tons due to a scheduled power plant outage 
lignite tons sold by nacoal s operating lignite mines were as follows for the year ended december coteau falkirk sabine san miguel red river 


mlmc 
total lignite the florida dragline operations mined million  million  and million cubic yards of limerock for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total coal reserves declined to billion at december  from billion at december  primarily due to the expiration of non renewable coal leases in undeveloped areas and tons mined

net tonnage volume decreased at the project mining subsidiaries due to a customer s plant outage at falkirk and reduced customer requirements at coteau and sabine 
although tonnage volume decreased  revenues from the project mining subsidiaries increased primarily as a result of an increase in pass through costs at sabine 
income before taxes increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to i the contractual liquidated damages payments recorded by mlmc  ii initial lignite sales at mlmc  and iii increased tonnage volume at red river 
these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense 
net income in increased to million from million in as a result of these factors  partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate as compared with see effective tax rate discussion below 
compared with revenues for increased as compared with primarily due to increased pass through costs at coteau and sabine and increased tonnage volume at falkirk and red river 
income before taxes for declined as compared with primarily due to i increased maintenance  administration and fuel costs at san miguel  which is not operated on a cost plus basis  ii a write off of million in of previously capitalized development costs incurred for a power plant and mine development project in turkey which nacoal no longer intends to pursue  iii charges paid to nacco for services provided by the parent company  which began in  and iv reduced royalty income 
the decline in net income in as compared with as a result of these factors was partially offset by i a non recurring cumulative effect of accounting change expense recognized in for the write off of previously capitalized start up costs and ii favorable tax adjustments in relating to the resolution of tax issues provided for in prior years

interest expense on debt allocated to finance mlmc was being capitalized prior to the second quarter of as part of the mine development activities 
beginning in the second quarter of as a result of the effective completion of the initial mine development phase at mlmc  interest expense on debt allocated to finance mlmc is being expensed 
interest expense at the project mines decreased in and as compared with primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
other net from other mining operations includes a charge from the parent company of million and million  in and  respectively  for fees incurred by nacco on nacoal s behalf 
the effective tax rate increase in as compared with and is primarily due to a greater proportion of income from operations not currently eligible to record a permanent tax benefit from percentage depletion 
the effective tax rate in reflects an income tax benefit on pre tax income primarily due to both the increased effect of percentage depletion and a nonrecurring adjustment for the resolution of certain tax issues provided for in prior years

a total of  units were shipped in compared with  units shipped the rate of monthly retail orders in the us and canada declined approximately percent from the peak month in as compared with the lowest month in nmhg wholesale s revenues also declined due to lower parts sales resulting from reduced lift truck utilization which is typical in this stage of a capital goods recession 
the decrease in revenues  which was primarily driven by unit volume  was partially offset by a shift in mix to higher priced lift trucks 
operating profit decreased to million for from million for the decrease in operating profit was largely due to reduced unit and parts volume and resulting reductions in the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs and related manufacturing inefficiencies 
additionally  operating profit was adversely affected by million of expenses incurred during related to the danville plant closure announced in and a restructuring charge of million recognized in for cost reductions in europe

nmhg retail compared with revenues increased percent to million for from million for largely as a result of the effect of a full year of revenues in from dealerships acquired in asia pacific in the fourth quarter of this revenue growth was partially offset by lower parts and service revenues and unfavorable pricing and product mix 
operating loss in was million compared with an operating loss of million in the increase in operating loss was primarily due to several non recurring special adjustments in the majority of these special adjustments were recognized in europe  which accounted for a significant portion of nmhg retail s operating loss 
the operating loss includes a charge of million for a loss on the sale of certain wholly owned dealers and related wind down costs 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this transaction 
the operating loss also includes a million restructuring charge for downsizing to match current levels of demand at retail operations in europe that nmhg retail had acquired over the last few years 
in addition  the operating loss includes charges of approximately million to reduce asset values and increase reserves reflective of the weakened capital goods markets  establish full accounting consistency among retail operations on a global basis and to cause those dealers previously reporting on a one month lag to report on months consistent with the rest of nmhg

this estimate could change during the execution of the restructuring plan 
compared with revenues increased million  or percent  due to acquisitions of retail dealerships in asia pacific and  to a lesser degree  europe 
revenues from volume growth at comparable dealerships also contributed slightly to the increase in revenues but were entirely offset by adverse currency effects in europe and an increase in the elimination of intercompany shipments from nmhg wholesale to nmhg retail 
operating results for in the americas improved as compared with the prior year primarily due to a decrease in administrative support costs 
operating results for in asia pacific improved as compared with the prior year primarily due to favorable operating results contributed by current year acquisitions 
increased net loss was driven by increased losses in europe  primarily due to increased pricing competition as a result of a weak euro and due to continued integration  infrastructure  interest  amortization and administrative costs necessary to build the retail segment 
liquidity and capital resources nmhg wholesale has a million revolving credit facility the facility that expires june the facility has performance based pricing which sets interest rates based upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets

nmhg also has separate credit facilities totaling million  of which million was available at december  and maintains additional uncommitted lines of credit totaling million  which was all available at december  although nmhg s primary financing facility expires in june  nmhg anticipates that a new credit facility will be obtained in or before june while there can be no assurances as to the specific terms of the refinancing  including the nature of the covenants and restrictions  nmhg expects that interest rates under the new facility will be higher based on its evaluation of the generally higher interest rate spreads charged today versus interest rate spreads in effect when nmhg wholesale s facility was structured in nmhg wholesale has assumed that the outstanding balance under the facility at the time of refinancing will be financed with a combination of short term and long term financing 
however  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  the outstanding balance under the facility will be classified as a current liability until the facility is refinanced 
the amount outstanding that is classified as a current liability at december  is million 
with the expectation of the refinancing of the nmhg facility prior to its expiration in june  nmhg believes that funds available under its credit facilities and operating cash flows are sufficient to finance all of its operating needs and commitments arising during the foreseeable future 
nmhg wholesale s accounts receivable securitization program the program to sell domestic accounts receivable was terminated on december  as a result  nmhg wholesale is relying on the facility to finance accounts receivable that otherwise would have been sold under the program prior to december  additional borrowings from the facility of million were used to finance the outstanding balance of accounts receivable sold pursuant to the program on december  as a result of the termination of the program  an increase in interest expense arising from increased outstanding borrowings is expected to be offset by a decrease in the cost of the program  which is classified in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income loss as other net

total contractual cash obligations as noted above  the nmhg facility expires in june and is anticipated to be refinanced prior to its expiration 
an event of default  as defined in the nmhg facility agreement  in nmhg s term loan agreements and in nmhg s operating and capital lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred or is anticipated to occur 
in addition  nmhg has the following commitments at december  total standby recourse or repurchase obligations guarantees total commercial commitments guarantees and standby recourse or repurchase obligations primarily represent guarantees of residual values or recourse obligations to repurchase lift trucks subject to certain terms and conditions under financing agreements made between nmhg s customers and financing companies in conjunction with the customer s financing of lift trucks purchased from nmhg 
for these transactions  nmhg generally retains a security interest in the lift truck  such that nmhg would take possession of the lift truck in the event that nmhg would become liable under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations 
generally  these commitments are due upon demand in the event of default by the customer 
the amount of the standby recourse or repurchase obligations increase and decrease over time as obligations under existing arrangements expire and new obligations arise in the ordinary course of business 
losses anticipated under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations are not significant and have been reserved for in the consolidated financial statements

the increase in total net tangible assets of million is primarily due to a million capital contribution to nmhg retail in  which increased nmhg wholesale s investment in nmhg retail 
in addition  the increase is due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million due to the timing of customer receipts at year end versus vendor and debt payments after year end

decreased unit pricing primarily resulting from increased competition also caused revenues to decline as compared with the prior year 
the decline in housewares revenues was partially offset by increased sales of general electric branded products to wal mart and the introduction of trueair tm home odor eliminators at hb ps  and increased revenues at kci primarily driven by an increase in the number of stores at december  compared with at december  housewares recorded an operating loss of million in compared with operating profit of million in the decline in operating profit resulted primarily from restructuring charges  described below  of million recognized in and a million charge in for the write off of receivables from customers that filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
excluding these items  operating results decreased as a result of i a decrease in the average sales price  ii increased advertising costs incurred to support the trueair product introduction  iii a shift in mix to lower margin units and iv unfavorable manufacturing overhead costs  partially offset by favorable material costs at hb ps and improved operating profit at kci 
the decline in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on the pre tax loss 
net loss was million for as compared with net income of million for primarily due to the factors affecting operating profit 
on january   one of hb ps largest customers  a major retail chain  filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  which allows this customer to reorganize and seek protection from its creditors 
as a result  hb ps recognized a charge of million related to receivables due from this customer as of december  hb ps believes that the remaining receivable balance at december  due from this customer is collectible  however  collection may take more than one year 
the customer has targeted emergence from chapter in in and  sales to this customer were approximately million and million  respectively  and represented percent and percent  respectively  of housewares revenues

the estimated cash outflows required for this plan are expected to be almost entirely offset by cash inflows from the anticipated sale of fixed assets and tax benefits associated with the plan

future expenses  which are not eligible for accrual at december   are estimated to be million pre tax in annual pre tax cost savings are estimated to be million beginning in in the fourth quarter of  hb ps recognized a charge of million relating to severance benefits to be paid to personnel in all functional areas located at the company s headquarters 
this restructuring plan was initiated primarily as a cost cutting measure in response to reduced overall consumer demand caused by the us economic slowdown 
headcount was reduced by  or approximately percent of the total corporate personnel 
as of december   payments of million have been made 
payments in respect to the remainder of the charge  or million  are expected to be made during the first half of the full benefit from this restructuring is estimated to be million pre tax beginning in compared with housewares revenues improved in primarily due to unit volume growth at hbps 
unit volume at hb ps increased percent to million units sold in from million units sold in  primarily due to increased demand for contact grills  slow cookers and irons  and from initial shipments of ge branded products to wal mart  which began in august revenues also increased at kci primarily due to an increase in the number of stores

the decline in the average sales price in as compared with was primarily due to intense competition 
increased manufacturing costs were driven by i increased materials costs  especially for petroleum based resins and packaging materials  ii increased transportation costs driven by rising fuel costs and iii increased warehousing costs due to start up inefficiencies at the new consolidated distribution center in memphis 
increased manufacturing costs were partially offset by favorable mexican peso exchange rates 
housewares operating profit declined to percent of revenues in from percent of revenues in operating profit declined due to the percentage point decline in gross profit discussed above and due to an increase in administration costs at kci  partially offset by a decline in direct marketing costs at hb ps

liquidity and capital resources hb ps credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility the hb ps facility that i provides financing up to million  ii is secured by substantially all of hb ps assets  iii provides lower interest rates if hb ps achieves certain interest coverage ratios  iv allows for interest rates quoted under a competitive bid option and v allows advances up to million from hb ps to kci 
in december  the hb ps facility was amended to modify the covenant requirements and redefine covenant calculations so that the recognition of the restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of did not cause a violation of covenants under the hb ps facility 
in addition to the change in the covenant requirements and calculations  the applicable margin added to the base rate of interest increased and the facility fee on the available borrowings increased 
prior to the amendment  for the year ended december   the hb ps facility provided for an interest rate of libor plus percent and a facility fee of percent 
after the amendment  effective january   the hb ps facility provides for an interest rate of libor plus percent and a facility fee of percent 
interest rates and facility fees  however  are subject to change based on the level of ebitda to interest expense ratio  as defined  hb ps achieves each quarter 
at december   hb ps had million available under this facility  which expires in may in addition  hb ps has separate uncommitted facilities that permitted million of additional borrowings  of which million was available at december  subsequent to december   one of hb ps lenders reduced the availability under these uncommitted facilities by million in the normal course of business

however  the company has classified a portion of this facility  million  as a current obligation since that is the amount expected to be repaid in an event of default  as defined in the hb ps facility agreement and in housewares operating and capital lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred or is anticipated to occur 
housewares anticipates spending approximately million for property  plant and equipment in  compared with capital expenditures of million in and million in spending for capital expenditures was down in as compared with actual spending in and planned spending in primarily due to a delay in or elimination of certain projects

this obligation was initially recognized by bellaire as an extraordinary charge in to accrue for the estimated costs associated with the coal act 
see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease to the company s estimate of the umwa obligation in was made  in part  because of a us district court s ruling that was upheld by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit in which invalidated the social security administration s ssa assignment of certain retired coal miners to bellaire 
this ruling reduced the company s estimate of the total beneficiaries assigned to bellaire as part of the coal act 
subsequent to december   the company learned that the us supreme court has decided to review circuit court rulings whose decisions in this matter were in conflict 
the u 
s court of appeals for the sixth circuit ruled that the ssa assignments were invalid  while the u 
s court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the ssa assignments were valid 
if the us supreme court decides that the ssa assignments are valid  the company would need to revise its estimate of its obligation under the coal act which may result in an unfavorable adjustment to the consolidated financial statement  which could be material 
in addition  subsequent to december   the company learned that the us supreme court ruled that the ssa s assignment of certain retired coal miners to companies defined as successors in interest to a signatory operator no longer in business was not permitted under the coal act 
this decision is expected to result in a favorable impact to the company due to an anticipated credit for payments made to umwa for certain beneficiaries who were assigned to bellaire inappropriately and due to an anticipated reduction in bellaire s future obligation to umwa as a result of a decrease in the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire
