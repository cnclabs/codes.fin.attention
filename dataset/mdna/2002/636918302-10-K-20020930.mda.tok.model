health card derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services health card provides to its sponsors are related to pharmacy benefit programs and services 
health card also recognizes administrative fees and earns rebates at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the beginning of the month 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in health card s pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug as the cost is incurred 
the amount of revenue recognized is reduced by the amount of rebates that health card shares with its sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain limited cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of health card s revenues relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees in thousands years ended june  revenues relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    health card does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceuticals dispensed by the pharmacy network  although health card assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not health card is paid by its sponsors 
health card utilizes its comprehensive pharmacy benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue 
health card believes that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care  and therefore these services may provide an increasing source of revenue for health card in the future 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from the gross rebates received from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims are recognized as follows the contractual obligation of health card to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that health card receives 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
health card s portion of these rebates  which varies by sponsor  is recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
health card processes its rebate claims either direct with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  for which it receives administrative fees  or through a third party rebate administrator 
effective july   health card has entered into an agreement with the administrator to handle all of its consolidated rebate claims which it does not otherwise submit direct to the drug manufacturers 
the amount of rebates recognized as reductions to revenue or cost of claims is based on estimates tied to actual claims data 
the third party administrator provides estimates to health card based on its analysis of the amount of rebates that health card s claims should generate 
these estimates are prepared based on estimates of how health card s claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
under health card s contract with the administrator  health card receives a specified amount per claim 
therefore once the total number of claims is known  then the total amount of rebates to be received will be known 
these amounts are contractually required to be paid within days after the end of a quarter 
health card computes the amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data  the criteria established in each individual contract  and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse health card for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
certain of health card s sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by health card  which portion varies contractually by sponsor 
the manufacturer rebates retained by health card  after the sponsors receive their contractual amounts  have historically had a significant impact on health card s financial performance 
for the fiscal years ended june   and the rebates retained by health card has equaled  and  respectively  of the company s total gross profit 
due to the expected continued growth and diversification of health card s business  health card expects rebates to continue to account for a significant  but declining  percentage of its total gross profit 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or if the terms of health card s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered when these arrangements expire  there could be a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers 
health card believes that most of the drug manufacturers are fortune companies 
health card does not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on health card s gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  health card expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
health card plans to continue its organic growth through increased marketing of its services and by expanding the range of services offered  particularly to include value added consulting and information based services which health card believes to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  health card intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement its organic growth by making acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management service providers  as well as related services providers 
public offering on august   health card completed the sale of  shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering the public offering 
pursuant to the public offering  health card received net proceeds of approximately  concurrently  the bert e 
brodsky revocable trust the brodsky trust sold  shares of common stock of health card in an underwritten offering 
of the proceeds received by the brodsky trust  it used approximately  to partly repay certain indebtedness owed by certain affiliates of the brodsky trust to health card 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  of the increase  million  or was due to the inclusion of revenues from centrus  subsequent to january  pmp accounted for another million  or  of the increase since it was acquired on march  and included a full fiscal year in compared to less than four months in the fiscal year ended june  another million of the increase was due to revenues related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal the majority of the balance of the year over year increase was due primarily to increased revenues from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
two other factors affecting the year over year increase were rebates payable to the company s sponsors increased by for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenues this led to reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
secondly  there were certain contracts during fiscal year that the company recognized on a net revenue basis 
there were no contracts during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on the net revenue basis 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain limited cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
finally  revenues for the twelve months ended june  were negatively impacted by a reduction in revenues of  that arose when the company settled certain fees due from a major sponsor related to a capitation arrangement for calendar year cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  centrus accounted for million  or of the increase 
pmp accounted for another million  or of the increase 
the balance of the increase is related to the increased revenue as described above 
an increase of million  million of which is related to centrus  in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  led to a reduction in the year over year increase 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the increase relates primarily to the higher cost of claims on the centrus book of business  which serves managed care clients primarily 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
centrus cost of claims for the fiscal year ended june  ran about percentage points greater than the rest of the company s business  and since centrus accounted for of the company s revenue in the fiscal year  this impacted the overall cost of claims percentage 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition  to the revenue volume increase  centrus accounted for million  or  of the increase 
pmp accounted for another million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and admin istrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  declined from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the decrease year over year is again principally related to the lower margins achieved by centrus 
the company has also seen a decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the increase  or million  was related to the acquisition of centrus 
there were also year over year increases in the following areas i an approximate  increase in expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management  ii an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to increased hardware procurement and software development in prior periods  iii an approximate  increase in the use of outside consultants primarily to update the company s information technology infrastructure  and iv an approximate  increase in commission expense related to the increase in new revenues not related to the acquisitions 
partially offsetting these increases were i a reduction of approximately  related to actual payments made and or reserves accrued during the fiscal year ended june   but not the fiscal year ended june  related to the following matters a the settlement of the west contra costa lawsuit see note to the consolidated financial statements that comprise item hereof  b the reconciliation and settlement of amounts due to a former major sponsor see note to the consolidated financial statements  and c the settlement  in april of  of a certain patent infringement litigation involving the use by the company of certain pbm information technology systems  ii the reduction in general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates described below  and iii an approximate  decrease in intangible amortization due to the adoption of sfas per sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill as of july  see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates decreased approximately million  or  year over year from million to million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company has eliminated most of the related party transactions effective january  the majority of the decrease related to reduced information technology services and management and consulting services procured from affiliated companies 
the hiring of full time employees and the use of outside consultants replaced the use of affiliated companies to update the information technology infrastructure 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue improved from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  this improvement stems from the continued growth of the company due to improving efficiencies with scale 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized other income  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in net expense were an approximate  increase in interest expense  an approximate  decrease in interest income  and an approximate  gain on sold assets during the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the net increase in expense were the interest expense incurred on the company s revolving credit facility and on the note offering during the fiscal year ended june  to finance the acquisition of centrus see item  description of business recent acquisitions  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
partially offsetting the increase in interest expense was the approximate  deferred gain during the fiscal year ended june  on the sale of assets related to a sale leaseback transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale 
for the fiscal year ended june  revenues increased over the fiscal year ended june   while selling  general  and administrative expenses increased only 
in addition  while gross margin percentages declined year over year due to the acquisition of centrus  the gross profit dollars increased by 
these factors contributed to the marked improvement in profitability 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factor for the increase was the approximate million increase in operating income described above 
in addition  there was an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization  including centrus 
this increase was partially offset by an approximate  decrease in goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease stemmed primarily from a reduction in non deductible goodwill amortization 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
earnings per diluted share increased by  to for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  of the increase  million  or was due to the inclusion of revenues from pai  subsequent to july   and pmp  subsequent to march  million of the increase was due to revenues related to new sponsors or new services offered 
the majority of the balance of the year over year increase  or approximately million  was due primarily to increased revenues from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
both periods were negatively impacted by a net reduction in revenues that arose when the company settled certain fees due from a major sponsor related to a capitation arrangement for calendar years the net reduction in revenues was  for the fiscal year ended june   and  for the fiscal year ended june  the calendar year and contract with this sponsor is no longer a capitation arrangement 
revenues for both the fiscal years were adjusted based on eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives coupons  rebates and discounts 
the financial impact of this is to reduce revenues by the amount of rebates to be paid to sponsors and reduce cost of claims by the gross amount of rebates received by the company 
previously the net difference between the gross amount received by the company and the amount paid to sponsors was treated as a reduction in cost of claims with no change to revenue 
the impact of this change was to reduce revenue and cost of claims by million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  pai and pmp accounted for million  or of the increase 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the percentage for the fiscal year ended june  was favorably impacted by a  reduction in rebates payable  which reduced cost of claims  which arose when the company reevaluated its liabilities to a plan sponsor 
the effect of this reduction is unrelated to the reduction in revenues and cost of claims described in the preceding paragraph 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   an million  or  increase 
pai and pmp accounted for million  or  of the increase 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the decline is partially attributable to the impact of the one time adjustment  described in the explanation for the  change in cost of claims above 
the company has also seen a decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the increase  or million  was related to the inclusion of pai and pmp in the consolidated numbers 
the balance of the growth in these expenses was principally related to five areas i an approximate  increase in expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management  ii an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to increased hardware procurement and software development  iii an approximate  increase in data processing charges related to increased information technology services  iv an aggregate of approximately  related to actual payments made and or reserves accrued related to the following matters a the settlement of the west contra costa lawsuit see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  b the reconciliation and settlement of amounts due to a former major sponsor see note to the consolidated financial statements  and c the settlement of a certain patent infringement litigation involving the use by the company of certain pbm information technology systems and v an approximate  increase in legal fees related primarily to the defense of the items discussed in iv above 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates increased approximately  or  year over year from  to  for the fiscal year ended june  and june   respectively 
the majority of the increase related to additional rent related to additional space taken in fiscal year  increased information technology services  and additional administrative support services and supplies to support the continued expansion of the business 
other income  net  declined by approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended june   to  in the fiscal year ended june  the main factor in the decline was an approximate  increase in interest expense  primarily related to the fact that the company entered into a capital lease agreement with hewlett packard for computer hardware and related software that went into effect in march the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an approximate  increase in interest income related to increased cash flow due to the inclusion of pai  pmp and spc 
income before income taxes declined approximately  or  from approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the decline were the one time adjustments noted above i the  revenue reduction in the fiscal year ended june   ii the  payments accrued reserve for settlements in the fiscal year ended june   and iii the  reduction in rebates payable in the fiscal year ended june  while income before income taxes declined year over year  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for these same periods actually increased by approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  this was due to the inclusion of approximately  of goodwill amortization related to the pai and pmp acquisitions in the period ended june   approximately  of depreciation of pai s and pmp s assets during this same year  as well as approximately  of incremental depreciation and amortization of new assets procured and capitalized during the year ended june  these increases offset the approximate  decline in operating income year over year 
there were a total of four negative adjustments reflected in the company s financial performance during the fiscal year ended june   related to settlements with sponsors and or lawsuits 
these settlements  which are described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements that comprise item hereof  reduced income before income taxes by approximately  of this total   was actually paid out during the fiscal year  with the balance to be paid during the fiscal year ended june  the company is not currently aware of any other issues that might require a settlement 
the company believes its bad debt reserves and other reserves should be sufficient based on current information 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease stemmed primarily from a lower effective state tax rate net of federal taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades and the funding of accounts receivable 
the company also requires cash for potential acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management companies or of companies providing related services 
as of june   the company had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of june  the primary reason for the decline in working capital was the acquisition of centrus for million in cash 
this decline was partially offset by the increased profitability generated by the company during the fiscal year ended june  the company has now acquired three companies since july utilizing primarily cash 
this has had the effect of increasing the company s working capital deficits until sufficient profitability is generated to pay back the cost of the acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
of the million increase  million is related to increased net income generated during the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   accounts payable increased by million primarily related to centrus claims and rebates payables being added 
at the same time  accounts and rebates receivables increased by million  again primarily due to centrus 
the net effect of these two items was million of net cash provided by operations 
for the fiscal year ended june  accounts and rebates receivables increased by million and accounts payable increased by million  a net provision of cash of million  a difference of million during the two periods 
historically  the timing of the company s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and the company s pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to the company s payments to participating pharmacies being slower than its corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
the company believes that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  the company could require additional working capital financing 
the company has put in place a million revolving credit facility for acquisitions and working capital financing 
however  if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if the company were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary differences in the two periods were the acquisitions completed 
the fiscal year ended june  included the acquisitions of pai and pmp which used net cash of million 
the fiscal year ended june  included the acquisition of centrus which used million of net cash and million of additional consideration paid to the pai shareholders see note to consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
the difference in the amount of net cash required for these three acquisitions was million 
the net cash outlay for pai as of june  was million  representing the initial payment of million plus million of related expenses  plus the in additional consideration  less pai s cash balance at july  of million 
the net cash outlay for pmp was million  representing the initial payment of million plus million of related expenses  less pmp s cash balance at march  of million 
the net cash outlay for centrus was million  representing the initial payment of million plus of related expenses 
none of centrus existing cash was acquired 
partially offsetting the increase in cash used over the two periods was the million gross proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction in october see note to consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
during fiscal year  the company entered into three capital lease transactions for hardware and software 
the purchase price of these capital assets was  one hardware lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  another hardware lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  the software lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  with the acquisition of centrus  the company assumed five capital leases for computer and telephone equipment 
the principal balance of these assets at the time of the acquisition was  the leases have various terms and payments 
three of those leases have subsequently been paid off in full 
the principal balance of all remaining capital leases as of june  was approximately  the company has entered into various real estate operating leases with both related and unrelated parties 
the company has entered into various operating leases with unrelated third parties for office equipment 
these leases have different payment terms and expirations dates 
the company also entered into a sale leaseback operating lease of certain fixed assets principally computer hardware and externally developed software with an affiliate of the company s vice chairman 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof for a further description of these various leases 
on january   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility  details of which are set forth in item above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowings of million under the facility were used to finance part of the purchase price of the company s acquisition of centrus 
the facility contains various covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the agreements governing the facility 
as of september   approximately million was outstanding under the facility  and the company was in compliance with its financial ratios covenants 
the total future payments under these contractual obligations as of june  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations  operating leases      sale leaseback  total contractual cash obligations      pai stockholders were eligible to receive up to  in additional consideration payable in combination of cash and common stock if certain financial targets of pai were met for the fiscal years ended june  and these targets have been achieved and the million has been earned 
at the end of august   in cash was paid  and  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share were issued to the pai stockholders 
at the end of august   in cash was paid  and  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share were issued to the pai stockholders 
the members of pmp are eligible to receive additional consideration of up to  if certain pmp clients are retained over the next three years 
these targets were not met in the first year so no additional consideration was due and payable 
it is the company s expectations that these amounts will not be earned in the second and third years either as the identified clients were not generally retained directly  although they were replaced 
the shareholders of centrus are eligible to receive additional consideration of up to  payable over three years  if certain financial targets are met over the next two years 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated party for computer software products and professional services 
the agreement required the company to pay an initial license fee 
in addition  if certain milestones are met based on the number of processed claims  as defined in the agreement  the initial license fee increases in specified increments 
to date  four such milestones have been met  resulting in a increase in the license fee 
the agreement also provides for the annual payment of a fee for maintenance and updating services equal to of the initial license fee  as defined 
it is anticipated that  based on internal growth and the centrus acquisition  that the last milestone will be met 
if the remaining milestone is reached  the cash outlay by the company would be  the company anticipates that current cash positions  after its three acquisitions and the repayment of certain affiliate and shareholder debt  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of the company s stated goals to acquire other pharmacy benefit management companies  evidenced by the three acquired since july this will require cash and depending on the company s evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required 
in the event that the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate  or the proceeds from the facility prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
other matters inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on health card s net income 
subsequent events on august   the company announced that it has signed a letter of intent to acquire wellpartner inc  a home delivery pharmacy based in portland  oregon 
wellpartner offers personal pharmacy convenience through mail  telephone  facsimile  or online shopping to members throughout the united states 
if this acquisition is consummated  the company believes it will enhance its ability to offer integrated  full service  mail order pharmacy services to its customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates general health card s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon health card s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires health card to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also effect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  health card evaluates its estimates  including those related to rebate income  bad debt  intangible assets  income taxes and financing operations 
health card bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others revenue recognition the company has historically entered into two types of arrangements for the payment of administrative fees fee for service per claim charges and capitation per member per month charges 
under the fee for service arrangement  the company is paid by its sponsors for the company s contractually agreed upon rates based upon actual claims adjudicated plus a fixed transaction fee 
under the capitation arrangement  the fee is based on the number of participants per month  the company pays for the cost of prescriptions filled and thus shares the risk of operating profit or loss with these plans 
since january   all services have been provided on a fee for service basis only 
revenue under the fee for service arrangement is recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
included as revenue are the company s administrative fees  and charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed by the company s network of pharmacies 
revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates paid to the company s sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain limited cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
rebates are recognized when the company is entitled to them in accordance with the terms of its arrangements with drug manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and sponsors  and when the amount of the rebates is determinable 
the company records the gross rebate receivable and the appropriate payable to the sponsors based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement 
the estimates are based upon the claims submitted and the company s rebate experience  and are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
bad debt health card maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the liability of its sponsors to make required payments 
if the financial condition of health card s sponsors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred taxes health card periodically considers whether or not it should record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while health card has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event health card were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should health card determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on july  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended june   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
capitalized software the costs of software developed for internal use incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
direct costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the post implementation operation stage are expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  commencing on the date the software is placed into use  primarily three years
