item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state it produced business in prior to the company expanded its operations into georgia and illinois in with the acquisition of american fidelity insurance group afi in december  now american mercury insurance group ami  the company expanded into the states of oklahoma and texas 
the company further expanded its operations into the state of florida during further expansion into texas occurred with the concord insurance services  inc transaction in december and the mercury county mutual insurance company mcm transaction in september in  the company expanded into virginia and new york 
during  approximately of the company s net premiums written were derived from california 
in california  as in various other states  all property and casualty rates must be approved by the insurance commissioner before they can be used 
in february  the california insurance commissioner approved new rates which were designed to improve the company s competitive position for new insureds 
these rate changes  which became effective on may   provided for decreases in premium rates for new insureds 
several rate modifications were approved and made effective subsequent to may  a rate change made april   reduced rates by approximately and was primarily made to improve mercury s competitive position in the marketplace 
on august   the company increased premium rates by on its non standard line and on its non good driver private passenger automobile line written by mercury casualty company 
the company recently received approval for a rate increase for private passenger automobile insurance in mercury insurance company  which represents approximately of company wide premiums written  and a combined rate increase for private passenger automobile insurance in mercury casualty company and california automobile insurance company  which represent approximately of company wide premiums written 
these increases went into effect for all new and renewal california business as of march  since march   private passenger automobile policies in force in california have increased from approximately  to  at december   an annual rate of increase of approximately 
policy count growth for the year was at a rate  an improvement over when the rate was down negligibly from the prior year 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued permanent rating factor regulations designed to implement the requirements that automobile insurance rates be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the law further requires that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the company submitted a proposed rating plan in response to these regulations in march the company s plan was approved by the california doi and became effective october  although the rate changes produced some minor dislocations  implementation of the plan has not materially changed the company s overall competitive position or its profitability 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
the company carries its fixed maturity and equity investments at market value as required for securities classified as available for sale by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company constantly evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the statement of income  as required by sfas no 
 if the circumstances warrant 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet to realized investment losses on the statements of income 
the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits incidental to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities became effective for fiscal years beginning after june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  this standard  adopted by the company on january  had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective january  sfas no 
requires companies to apply the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method 
sfas no 
changes the method by which companies may recognize intangible assets in purchase business combinations and generally requires identifiable intangible assets to be recognized separately from goodwill 
in addition  it eliminates the amortization of all existing and newly acquired goodwill on a prospective basis and requires companies to assess goodwill for impairment  at least annually  based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
at december   the company had on its books approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of concord and approximately million of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives related to the elm acquisition 
as required by sfas  the company has assessed these assets and determined that they are not impaired 
furthermore  as required by sfas  the company will no longer amortize these assets after total amortization expense in related to these assets was million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased and net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts recorded in these premium increases were principally attributable to increased policy sales in the california automobile insurance lines as well as increased production in california homeowners insurance  florida automobile insurance and texas automobile insurance 
the california private passenger automobile insurance marketplace has entered a period of rising premium rates 
virtually all of the company s competitors have recently filed for rate increases which helped spur the company s premium growth during in august the company received approval from the california department of insurance for a rate increase in its non standard line and in its non good driver private passenger automobile line written by mercury casualty company 
the company recently received approval for a rate increase for private passenger automobile insurance in mercury insurance company  which represents approximately of company wide premiums written  and a combined rate increase for private passenger automobile insurance in mercury casualty company and california automobile insurance company  which represent approximately of company wide premiums written 
these increases go into effect for all new and renewal california business as of march  the company plans to make additional filings for rate increases in california as well as other states 
despite the increases  the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company feels that its marketing effort combined with price and reputation make the company very competitive in california 
the gaap loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the less favorable loss ratio is primarily driven by higher loss ratios in the california automobile and homeowners lines of business which are partially offset by lower loss ratios in the florida  georgia and illinois automobile lines of business 
the gaap expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the expense ratio was relatively unchanged as total expenses increased at essentially the same rate as premium volume 
the majority of expenses vary directly with premiums 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were  million  resulting in an underwriting gain premiums earned less total losses and expenses excluding interest for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million cost basis was  compared with on average investments of  million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared to in the higher tax rate and decrease in investment yields in reflect a shift in the mix of the company s portfolio from non taxable to taxable issues 
bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared to million in approximately million of bonds are expected to mature or be called in realized investment gains in were million  compared with realized gains of million in the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the higher rate in reflects a shift in a portion of the company s investments from tax exempt issues to taxable issues 
net income in was million or per share diluted  compared with million or per share diluted  in diluted per share results are based on million average shares in and million shares in basic per share results were in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased and net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts recorded in contributing to the overall premium written growth were initial automobile premiums in texas from the recent concord agency transaction  and increases in california homeowner premiums  california non standard automobile premiums and florida automobile premiums 
the company s core california private passenger automobile premiums were relatively flat and ami experienced a decline in premium volume 
the gaap loss ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the major reason for the less favorable result is an increase in severity for california automobile claims which is the result of inflationary trends in health care costs  auto parts and body shop labor costs 
the gaap expense ratio in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the decrease was due mainly to a reduction in base and contingent commissions  which are tied to loss performance  partially offset by an increase in advertising spending 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were  million  resulting in an underwriting gain premiums earned less total losses and expenses excluding interest for the period of million compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million cost basis was  compared with on average investments of  million in the effective tax rate on investment income in was  compared with in the higher tax rate in reflects a modest shift in the company s portfolio mix from non taxable to taxable issues 
bonds matured and called in totaled million compared with million in realized investment gains in were million compared with realized losses of million in the gains realized in were designed to utilize capital loss tax benefits 
included in losses was a million write down of a preferred stock investment that became other than temporarily impaired during the third quarter 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the lower rate in is primarily attributable to the increased proportion of investment income which consists primarily of tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income in contrast to underwriting income which is taxed at the full corporate rate of 
net income in was million or per share diluted  compared with million or per share diluted  in diluted per share results are based on million average shares in and million shares in basic per share results were in and in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities in  was million  while funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments was million  of which approximately was represented by the sale of fixed maturities 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity investments increased by million during the year 
equity investments  including perpetual preferred stocks  increased by million at cost  while short term cash investments increased by million 
the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale that were sold  called or matured during the year was million 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity  as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with a gain of million at december  the decrease in market values since december  were largely caused by widening spreads on many of the company s corporate bonds 
the widening spreads reflect the perceived increased credit risk by the market and by the major rating agencies in the wake of both the september events and the industry wide accounting concerns raised after the collapse of enron 
the company s unrestricted cash and short term investments totaled million at december  together with funds generated internally  such liquid assets are adequate to pay claims without the sale of long term investments 
as of december   the average standard poor s rating of the  million bond portfolio at amortized cost was a  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call provisions  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years 
duration measures the length of time it takes to receive all cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest income 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically and by obligor 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
at december  bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or less than of total assets 
a decrease in the portfolio s average rating from aa at december  to a at december  reflects some downgrades in the company s existing holdings as well as the fact that a larger percentage of the portfolio is invested in corporate bonds which generally have lower ratings than municipal issues 
fixed maturity investments of  million amortized cost  include million amortized cost of sinking fund preferred stocks  principally utility issues 
the market value of all fixed maturities exceeded cost by million at december  except for company occupied buildings and land to be utilized for company office space  the company has no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and banking sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
on august   the company completed a public debt offering issuing million of senior notes payable under a million shelf registration filed with the sec in july the notes are unsecured  senior obligations of the company with a annual coupon payable on august and february each year commencing february  these notes mature on august  the company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million  inclusive of underwriter s fees 
these costs are deferred and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes 
the notes were issued at a slight discount at  making the effective annualized interest rate including debt issuance costs approximately 
as part of the elm county mutual transaction the company agreed to make annual million payments to employers reinsurance corporation over years beginning september  at december   the company is carrying a note payable for million  which represents the discounted value of the six remaining payments using a rate 
the company had outstanding debt at december  of million 
prior to the million senior note issuance  the company had million payable under a revolving credit facility due november  and million payable under a million revolving credit facility due october  the interest rate on these two loans was variable and through august  was priced off of the eurodollar london interbank rate libor making the effective interest rate and  respectively 
on august   the company repaid the entire balance of both the million and million borrowings with proceeds received from the million senior note issuance 
the company also terminated the million revolving credit facility 
the million facility that expired on october  was not renewed 
prior to the issuance of the senior notes  the company used short term floating rate bank debt as part of its capital structure 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on the senior notes for a floating rate of libor plus basis points 
the company believes that the swap will significantly reduce interest expense in  but does expose it to higher interest expense in future periods  should libor rates increase 
the swap will be accounted for as a fair value hedge under sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the stock repurchase program  the company may purchase over a one year period up to million of mercury general s common stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at the discretion of management 
the program will be funded by the sale of lower yielding tax exempt bonds  the proceeds of the senior note issuance and internal cash generation

the shares have been allocated to employees over the amortization period of the loan  with the initial allocation made in december the remaining balance of the loan of million was retired in march with the proceeds of contributions to the plan by the company for the year  and the remaining unallocated shares were credited to employees esop balances at december  in august  the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share 
the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
at december  the loan balance was million  recorded in the balance sheet as other liabilities 
the shares are being allocated to the employees over a five year period  with the initial allocation made in december since dividends on unallocated shares held by the plan are tax deductible if they are used for debt service  as are company contributions to the plan  the net  after tax interest cost to the company for the borrowed funds used for the plan stock purchase is less than the effective rate of interest on the loan  which  in  was 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula has been designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has estimated the risk based capital requirements of each of its insurance subsidiaries as of december  each of the insurance companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company anticipates spending approximately million of internally generated funds in for the construction of a new office building in rancho cucamonga  california 
the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established in to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
during the second quarter of  the company began placing all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the california earthquake authority 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most current information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   is approximately million 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the insurance companies of  million at december   and net written premiums for the twelve months ended on that date of  million  the ratio of writings to surplus was approximately to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of preferred stocks  account for of total investments at market 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
during  lower market interest reduced the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the average modified duration of the portfolio declined from years at december  to years at december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for equity investments was a buy and hold strategy which focuses primarily on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
during most of the year  non sinking fund preferred stocks were not actively traded by the market  though lower interest rates intrinsically benefit their market values 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the remainder of the equity portfolio  representing of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  in august the company repaid total short term floating rate bank debt of million with the proceeds from the issuance of the million fixed rate senior notes maturing on august  to the extent market interest rates fluctuate  the fair value of the fixed rate debt will fluctuate in the opposite direction 
at december  the fair value of the debt was million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on the senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes  thus eliminating the market risk on the liability
