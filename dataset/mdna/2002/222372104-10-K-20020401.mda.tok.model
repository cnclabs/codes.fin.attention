item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s core business is residential mortgage banking 
historically  the vast majority of the company s earnings and capital investment was attributable to its mortgage banking business 
in recent years  the company has begun to significantly expand its operations beyond mortgage banking 
with its entry into banking in  the company now has five business segments mortgage banking  insurance  capital markets  global  and banking 
this diversification was done both to capitalize on meaningful synergies with the company s core mortgage banking business as well as to provide a steady source of earnings growth that is not as subject to the cyclical nature of the mortgage banking business 
although mortgage banking will remain the company s core business and management remains optimistic about mortgage banking s future prospects the company expects its non mortgage banking businesses to contribute a steadily increasing percentage of the company s overall earnings in the future 
the company s results of operations historically have been influenced primarily by the level of demand for mortgage loans  which is affected by external factors such as prevailing mortgage rates and the strength of the united states housing market 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies that have the greatest impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require the most judgment are those relating to its mortgage securitization activities and the ongoing valuation of retained interests  particularly mortgage servicing rights msrs  that emanate from those activities  and its hedging activities 
gain on sale the company securitizes substantially all of the mortgage loans it produces and sells those securities on a regular basis in the secondary mortgage market 
by products of those securitizations are certain retained interests  including msrs  interest only securities  principal only securities  and residual securities  which the company generally holds as long term investments 
in effect  the company determines the gain on sale of a security by allocating the acquisition cost of the underlying mortgage loans between the security and the retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the reported gain is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale of the security and its allocated cost 
following is a hypothetical example of this accounting concept acquisition cost of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security retained interests total fair value computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less allocated cost  x  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   retained interest valuation the determination of fair values of the retained interests at the initial recording and on an ongoing basis requires considerable management judgment 
unlike agency mortgage backed securities  the market value of retained interests is not readily ascertainable with precision because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
for some msrs  it is possible to indirectly ascertain approximate market values through observations of the whole loan mortgage market 
similarly  the market value of some interest only and principal only securities can be estimated based upon the observed prices of similar agency securities 
the company uses available market data along with industry convention as well as discounted cash flow models to arrive at the initial fair values of its retained interests 
once recorded  retained interests are periodically evaluated for impairment 
impairment is defined generally as a reduction in current fair value below carrying value 
if a retained interest is impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings 
msr impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance 
if the value of msrs subsequently increases  the valuation allowance can be recovered through a credit to current period earnings as of december   the msr impairment valuation allowance was million for other retained interests with the exception of principal only securities  if the value subsequently increases it is recognized prospectively through a higher effective yield 
generally  for impairment purposes  the company estimates fair values through use of proprietary zero volatility cash models and prepayment models 
the company has incorporated underlying assumptions it believes other major market participants would use to compute fair values 
with regard to msrs  the company has incorporated cash flow elements it believes other major market participants would consider to derive the fair value of msrs 
those cash flows associated with msrs consist of net service fees  earnings from escrow balances  late charges  prepayment penalties  cross sell activities  namely insurance and home equity loans  loan retention benefits  net captive reinsurance premiums  government loan remarketing gains  other miscellaneous fees  servicing operating costs  servicing advance costs  and foreclosure related costs 
at december   the company s investment in msrs was stratified as follows dollar amounts in millions total por tfolio at december  weighted mortgage principal percent average msr rate balance of total maturity years balance and under  over  excludes subservicing 
the following table shows the value sensitivity of the msrs and other retained interests to the key assumptions used by the company to determine their fair values at december  dollar amounts in thousands other retained interests msrs fair value of mortgage servicing rights  weighted average life in years weighted average prepayment speed annual rate impact of adverse change  impact of adverse change  weighted average discount rate annual rate impact of adverse change  impact of adverse change  weighted average lifetime credit losses impact of adverse change  impact of adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the preceding information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
in addition  in the above table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated independently without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  changes in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in credit losses  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the company reviews all major valuation assumptions periodically using the most recent empirical and market data available and makes adjustments where warranted 
msr amortization msrs are also subject to periodic amortization 
the company computes msr amortization by applying the ratio of the net msr cash flows projected for the current period to the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows 
the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows are determined at the beginning of each reporting period  using prepayment assumptions applicable at that time 
derivatives and hedging activities the company utilizes various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value 
the fair value for the majority of the derivative instruments is based on market or dealer quotes and  as such  does not require significant judgement 
the committed pipeline  which is comprised of interest rate lock commitments irlcs issued on residential mortgage loans held for sale the committed pipeline  is considered a portfolio of derivative instruments 
unlike the majority of the derivative instruments  the market value of the committed pipeline is not readily ascertainable with precision because irlcs are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
the company determines the fair value of the irlcs by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset while taking into consideration the probability that the irlcs will close 
the company uses sophisticated software to estimate the amount and timing of irlcs that will close based upon potential interest rate movements  the source of the applications  and their aging 
in addition  the company may qualify some of its hedging activities for hedge accounting  which requires on going testing of effectiveness 
management has discretion in determining how effectiveness will be tested 
generally  the company tests effectiveness using a statistical measure of effectiveness  which is documented prior to the adoption of hedge accounting 
change in fiscal year effective december   the company changed its year end from february to december information in this form k for the current year is representative of the ten month period march  through december  management changed the reporting period to conform the company s reporting periods to those required by the board of governors of the federal reserve for regulatory reporting purposes 
consolidated earnings performance ten months ended december  audited compared with ten months ended december  unaudited the company s diluted earnings per share for the ten months ended december  were  an all time record  despite the shortened reporting period 
net earnings were up from the ten month period ended december  this record earnings performance was driven principally by the record level of mortgage loans produced by the company billion as compared to billion for the year ago period 
industry wide  mortgage originations eclipsed trillion in calendar another record number driven in turn by record levels of refinance activity and housing activity in the united states 
especially with regard to refinances  this historic level of activity was stimulated by mortgage rates that reached forty year lows 
the level of housing activity that resulted in almost trillion in purchase mortgages is particularly noteworthy given the relative weakness in the overall national economy in in fact  the resilience of the united states housing market is widely credited for limiting the depth and breadth of the latest united states recession 
the unprecedented demand for mortgages drove not only record volumes but also record production margins  as industry capacity struggled to keep up with demand for most of the year 
the combination of record volumes and record margins propelled loan production pre tax earnings to million for the ten month period  up million from the year ago period 
the company significantly increased the number of sales and processing staff in its loan production divisions to cope with the unprecedented demand 
as volumes moderate  the incremental processing staff consisting largely of temporary employees will be reduced 
however  the company plans to continue building its sales staff despite any potential drop in loan origination volume as a key component of its purchase market share growth initiative 
on the negative side  the company experienced substantial runoff from its servicing portfolio during this  coupled with the expectation of continued higher than normal runoff as of year end  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of the company s msrs and other retained interests  net of hedge gains  for the ten months ended december  the combined amount of amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of hedge gain s  was million over the amount recorded for the ten months ended december  in short  the recent period was an extreme example of the dynamic balance between the company s loan origination and loan servicing businesses 
on a combined basis  the mortgage banking segment generated record pre tax earnings of million  up from the prior period 
the company s non mortgage banking businesses also were significant contributors to the record earnings performance in the most recent period 
in particular  the capital markets segment had pre tax earnings of million  up from million in the year ago period 
capital markets has grown its core franchise significantly over the last five years and is now among the top ten firms in the secondary mortgage market its niche 
this division was also a beneficiary of the robust activity in the secondary mortgage market  as well as the favorable yield curve 
in total  non mortgage banking businesses contributed million in pre tax earnings for the ten months ended december   up from million for the year ago period 
growth in non mortgage banking businesses is a key strategy to reduce variability of earnings due to changes in interest rates 
fiscal compared with fiscal the company s diluted earnings per share for fiscal were  the fourth largest amount in the company s history 
however  that amount represented a decline from fiscal after taking into account a one time deferred tax write off that increased earnings per share by in fiscal 
fiscal was accentuated by fierce competition in the mortgage industry  as lenders dealt with excess capacity remaining in the aftermath of the last refinance boom in this difficult environment was exacerbated by the inverted yield curve that existed throughout most of the year 
as a result of that environment  loan production pre tax earnings in fiscal were down from the prior year  despite a slight increase in loan volume 
in addition  although the servicing portfolio grew year over year  loan servicing earnings were down  due to an increase in net impairment of msrs and other retained interests of million 
incorporating the results of the company s loan closing services business  pre tax earnings from the company s core mortgage banking business were down in fiscal from fiscal on a positive note  as previously stated  the company did increase its servicing portfolio by and increased purchase mortgage originations by both key metrics as it relates to the company s long term performance 
in addition  the production of non traditional mortgage loans ie  home equity and sub prime loans increased in fiscal partially offsetting the decline in performance of its core business was the company s non mortgage banking businesses 
most notable was the insurance division  which contributed million in pre tax profits in fiscal  up million from fiscal this increase was attributable to balboa life and casualty group balboa  the company s insurance carrier  which had its first full year of operations  having been acquired in november  and to growth in the company s mortgage reinsurance business 
also contributing to the growth was the capital markets segment that  despite a difficult rate environment  posted a million increase in pre tax profits in fiscal combined  the non mortgage banking businesses had pre tax earnings of million in fiscal  up from fiscal operating segment results ten months ended december  audited compared with ten months ended december  unaudited the company s pre tax earnings by segment are summarized below 
ten months e nded dollar amounts in thousands december mortgage banking production  servicing  closing services  total mortgage banking  diversified businesses insurance  capital markets  global operations  banking  other  total diversified businesses  pre tax earnings  mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment is comprised of three distinct sectors loan production  loan servicing  and loan closing services 
in general  the loan production and loan closing services sectors perform at their best when mortgage rates are low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
consequently  given the historic low level of mortgage rates and attendant record level of mortgage originations and prepayments industry wide during the current period  it follows that the loan production and loan closing services sectors achieved historic highs in earnings and the loan servicing sector saw record losses 
to moderate the cyclical nature of the mortgage banking business the company strives to balance these sectors 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through three separate divisions of the company s principal subsidiary  countrywide home loans  inc chl and through full spectrum lending  inc 
all four units produced record volumes and earnings for the period 
the following table shows total loan volume by unit dollar amounts in millions loan product ion ten months e nded december consumer markets division  wholesale lending division  correspondent lending division  full spectrum lending  inc  the record demand for mortgages enabled the loan production sector to achieve record profit margins 
the loan production sector was capacity constrained and margins ie  points and fees charged were used to regulate the volume 
as can be inferred  the sector was operating at or near capacity throughout the period  which drove down per unit costs 
because of the excess demand  the loan production sector scaled back on its marketing expenses 
the overall increase in loan production volume was driven largely by refinances  although notably purchase money loans increased 
the increase in purchase money loans is significant as this is the stable growth component of the mortgage market refinances are driven largely by prevailing mortgage rates 
all divisions contributed to the increase in purchase money loans 
the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type dollar amounts in millions loan product ion ten months e nded december purchase  refinance  fixed rate  adjustable rate  also noteworthy was the volume of non traditional mortgages produced during the current period up from the year ago period 
these non traditional mortgages are a key component of the company s overall diversification initiative 
the following table summarizes this production non tradition al dollar amounts in millions loan producti on ten months en ded december sub prime  home equity  the company successfully retained a significant percentage of the customers who prepaid their mortgage during the period 
the overall retention rate was  for retail customers the rate was 
notably  of the consumer market division s total loan production during the period was sourced from the company s servicing portfolio 
the high retention rates during the most recent period were due  in part  to the high level of refinances 
the company has been most successful in retaining customers who refinance their existing mortgage in such an environment 
during the ten months ended december   of the consumer markets division s refinance loan volume was from existing mortgage customers 
this synergy is a major source of value derived from the company s msr investment 
the consumer markets division also successfully grew its commissioned sales force during the period  ending the year with  salespersons on staff 
the increased sales capacity was a major reason for the growth in purchase money loans 
at december   the company held billion of recently produced home equity loans in inventory 
had the company securitized and sold these loans on that date  the production sector would have recognized an additional gain on sale of approximately million 
the company elected to defer the sale of these loans because of its available financing capacity  improved overall economics  and the planned transfer of a portion of the loans to the company s new bank as a portfolio investment 
loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests  as well as profits from sub servicing activities in the united states 
the loan servicing sector incorporates a significant operation  namely the  employees that service the company s million mortgage customers 
how effectively this servicing operation drives down costs and increases ancillary income from the portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector 
the loan servicing sector experienced record losses during the recent period 
this was not unexpected given the level of refinance activity that ensued  driven by mortgage rates that reached forty year lows 
the company s msrs and other retained interests represent the present value of cash flow streams that are closely linked to the life of the underlying servicing portfolio 
the substantial increase in actual and forecasted prepayment activity reduced the life of the servicing portfolio and thus the value of the company s related investments  as reflected in the combined  million impairment charge and million in msr amortization for the period 
the msr impairment charge was partially offset by a servicing hedge gain of million 
the net impairment of million for the period is in tandem with the historic level of profits generated by the loan production sector 
in a stable interest rate environment  management would expect no significant impairment  and would expect to incur servicing hedge expense driven primarily by the composition of the hedge and the cost of the underlying options 
in concert with impairment  the company recorded million of msr amortization during the current period  as compared to million during the year ago period 
this increase reflected the reduction in estimated future cash flows from the msrs owing to higher expected overall prepayment rates 
despite the level of prepayments  the company was able to increase its servicing portfolio to billion at december   an increase from the prior year 
at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate was reduced from to 
the following table shows the weighted average note rate by major loan type weighted average in terest rate december  december  fixed rate mortgages conventional fha va subprime home equity total fixed rate mortgages adjustable rate mortgages conventional fha va subprime home equity total adjustable rate mortgages grand total federal housing administration department of veteran affairs closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies that provide credit reports  appraisals  title reports  and flood inspections primarily to the loan production sector but increasingly to third parties as well 
the company s integration of these previously out sourced services has provided not only incremental profits but also increased overall levels of service and quality control 
combined  the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  a increase over the year ago period 
this increase was in line with the company s growth in loan production 
during the period  approximately of landsafe s revenues were from third parties 
management believes that percentage will rise in the future 
the following table shows the units processed during the respective periods ten months ended ten months ended units in thousands december  december  credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals automated property valuation services  title reports default title orders other title and escrow services diversified businesses to reduce the variability of the company s earnings due to changes in interest rates  countrywide has implemented a synergistic diversification strategy  whereby the company has expanded into businesses that leverage off the mortgage banking platform 
pre tax earnings from these diversified businesses increased million in the ten months ended december  over the ten months ended december  insurance segment this segment consists of balboa which is a national provider of property  life and liability insurance  second charter reinsurance company which is a primary mortgage reinsurance company and insurance agency operations 
insurance agency operations consists primarily of countrywide insurance services  inc  which is a national insurance agency offering a full menu of insurance products directly to consumers and directnet insurance agency  which provides turnkey and customized personal insurance solutions to the customers of other financial institutions 
segment pre tax earnings increased over the prior year  to million 
following is the pre tax earnings by company ten months ended decem ber ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  balboa  second charter reinsurance company  insurance agency operations  other  the growth in pre tax earnings at balboa and second charter was driven largely by increased net written premiums 
following are the net written premiums for each company ten months ended december ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  balboa  second charter reinsurance company  second charter s increase in premiums was due to growth in the company s servicing portfolio  as well as to increased reinsurance coverage provided to various mortgage insurance companies on existing policies 
balboa s increase was attributable to growth both in its forced order and voluntary lines 
the growth in voluntary insurance was achieved through penetration of the company s mortgage customer base through countrywide insurance services  inc during the current period  balboa underwrote approximately of the policies placed by countrywide insurance services  inc following are the provisions for insurance losses recorded by each company ten months ended december ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  balboa  second charter reinsurance company  balboa s increase in insurance losses is in line with the increase in net earned premiums 
balboa manages its insurance risk very conservatively through reinsurance 
balboa seeks to earn profits by capitalizing on the company s customer base  and its institutional relationships  as well as through operating efficiencies and sound underwriting 
second charter historically has not experienced insurance losses  owing to a strong economy and to an even stronger housing market 
during the year the company revised its reinsurance contracts  in essence providing additional coverage in exchange for additional ceded premiums 
consequently  management expects second charter to incur insurance losses in the future  although absent a significant housing recession management believes second charter s profits will continue to rise in tandem with the servicing portfolio 
capital markets segment the capital markets segment ccm achieved record earnings of million for the ten month period  up from the year ago period 
ccm capitalized on the robust secondary mortgage market  high price volatility  and low short term interest rates that prevailed during the period 
countrywide securities corporation csc  the company s broker dealer  saw its total trading volume increase to trillion 
the following table shows the composition of csc s trading volume by instrument ten months ended december ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  mortgage backed securities  loans  asset backed securities  other  countrywide asset management corporation also benefited from the low interest rate environment 
following is a breakdown of ccm s pre tax earnings by company ten months ended dece mber ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  countrywide securities corporation  countrywide servicing exchange  countrywide asset management corporation  other approximately million of csc s pre tax earnings during the period resulted from sourcing the collateral for and underwriting billion of sub prime mortgage securitizations 
management views that particular activity as highly opportunistic 
countrywide asset management corporation s earnings stemmed primarily from third party sourcing and subsequent securitization of once delinquent fha and va loans 
the decline in profits in countrywide servicing exchange was reflective of the long term trend of reduced secondary trading of msrs that coincides with the consolidation trend in the mortgage industry 
management believes the highly favorable market conditions that prevailed in may not persist in and  consequently  it may be difficult for ccm to achieve earnings growth in however  management believes that ccm s core franchise can produce high levels of earnings in a less favorable environment 
global operations segment global had pre tax earnings of million  a increase over the year ago period 
the increase was attributable to higher negotiated fees and to greater processing volume and improved productivity 
management believes global will be successful in attracting significant additional third party business in in anticipation  global is gearing up its infrastructure 
longer term  management believes it will expand its international operations beyond the united kingdom 
management believes the company s advanced mortgage technology and expertise create an extraordinary opportunity in developing mortgage markets around the globe 
banking segment this segment commenced operations in calendar the segment achieved pre tax earnings of million for the period 
following is the composition of pre tax earnings by company ten months ended december ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  countrywide warehouse lending cwl  treasury bank bank holding company the record level of activity in the mortgage originations market enhanced earnings for cwl during the period  as cwl s secured loans outstanding reached a peak of billion 
looking forward  management believes the synergy between cwl and the correspondent lending division the company s correspondent production arm  as well as the ongoing reduction in supply of warehouse credit in the market  creates an opportunity for significant growth in cwl s market share 
how this will translate into growth in earnings is partly dependent on the degree of consolidation in the mortgage lending industry in the future 
treasury bank obtained regulatory approval of its three year business plan in november the plan calls for the bank to increase assets to billion  primarily sourced through the company s mortgage banking operation 
likewise  a significant portion of the bank s liabilities will come from the mortgage banking segment  primarily in the form of impound accounts  as well as consumer deposits solicited from the mortgage banking customer base 
largely because of these synergies  management is confident about achieving the bank s growth targets 
the bank s strategy entails holding loans in portfolio that historically would have been immediately securitized and sold in the secondary mortgage market 
management believes this strategy will increase earnings  as well as provide more stable earnings  over the long term although in the short term  reported profits will be impacted by the reduction in gains otherwise recognizable at time of sale 
the extent to which the bank generates long term incremental profits on a consolidated basis will depend largely on how treasury bank s overall cost of funds compare to those costs implicit in securitization 
fiscal compared with fiscal the company s pre tax earnings by segment are summarized below 
dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal mortgage banking production  servicing  closing services  total mortgage banking  diversified businesses insurance  capital markets  global  banking other  total diversified businesses  pre tax earnings  mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment is comprised of three distinct sectors loan production  loan servicing  and loan closing services 
in general  the loan production and loan closing services sectors perform at their best when mortgage rates are low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
to combat the cyclical nature of the mortgage banking business the company strives to balance these sectors 
loan production sector total loan volume increased in fiscal despite an estimated drop in market originations in calendar the correspondent lending division faired the best in a difficult operating environment  as expected  given the relative elasticity of their infrastructure and lack of dependence on refinances 
the following table shows total loan volume by unit dollar amounts in millions loan product ion fiscal fiscal consumer markets division  wholesale lending division  correspondent lending division  full spectrum lending  inc  the overall increase in loan production volume was driven entirely by purchase money loans  as refinances declined by owing to an increase in prevailing mortgage rates 
the increase in purchase money loans is significant as this is the stable growth component of the mortgage market refinances are driven largely by prevailing mortgage rates 
all divisions contributed to the increase 
the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and by interest rate type dollar amounts in millions loan product ion fiscal fiscal purchase  refinance  fixed rate  adjustable rate  also noteworthy was the volume of non traditional mortgages produced during the current period up from the year ago period 
these non traditional mortgages are a key component of the company s overall diversification initiative 
the following table summarizes this production non traditio nal dollar amounts in millions loan product ion fiscal fiscal sub prime  home equity  due to significant price competition in the prime  first lien  mortgage market driven by contraction in the market caused by the decline in refinances  the loan production sector experienced a decline in profit margins 
this decline was most severe in the consumer markets division  caused by its relatively high operating leverage and dependence on refinances 
importantly for the long term  in fiscal the consumer markets division commenced a fundamental restructuring of its business model 
specifically  the division began to build a best in class sales organization  consisting of a dedicated commissioned sales force and the attendant management  systems and operations support 
in addition  to create more flexible processing capacity the consumer markets division began to centralize their processing operations 
management believes these changes to the business model  coupled with its ongoing investment in technology  will have a dramatic positive impact on the division s performance in the future 
the wholesale lending division made significant improvements during fiscal in both internal systems as well as its business partner website cwbc which management believes will better position the division to compete in the future 
specifically  the division has seen fundings through cwbc grow from of its total fundings in fiscal to of total fundings in fiscal and this growth continues 
the use of cwbc is a more streamlined means of conducting business between the wholesale lending division and its customers will better position the wholesale lending division for the future 
in fiscal  the correspondent lending division consolidated the division s three national operations sites to a single location 
this not only has benefited the division by annual cost savings  it also provided the advantage of ensuring a higher knowledge base and a consistent culture throughout the division 
loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests  as well as profits from sub servicing activities in the united states 
it does incorporate a significant operation  namely the  employees that serviced the company s million mortgage customers as of february  how effectively this servicing operation drives down costs and increases ancillary income from the portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector 
profits for this sector were down in fiscal despite a growth in the servicing portfolio and a growth in periodic servicing earnings 
this contradictory performance was largely attributable to the servicing hedge 
in fiscal  impairment of retained interests after servicing hedge gains was a net loss of million  as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal notably  periodic loan servicing earnings loan servicing sector pre tax earnings before impairment  servicing hedge  and corporate interest allocation increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the disproportionate growth in periodic earnings was attributable to the company s increased investment in residuals and to per loan increases in late charges and other miscellaneous fees  largely attributable to the efforts of loan servicing personnel 
the swing in net performance of the servicing hedge was not unexpected 
the servicing hedge is designed to offset changes in values of retained interests  taking into account the anticipated performance of the loan production sector 
in fiscal  the servicing hedge was structured to generate net reportable gains in a rising rate environment as did occur in fiscal to offset an expected decline in loan production sector earnings 
conversely  in fiscal  the servicing hedge was structured to generate net impairment losses in a falling rate environment as did occur at the tail end of fiscal in anticipation of incremental loan production sector profits 
this concept carried forward to the ten month period ended december  the company recorded million of msr amortization during the current period  as compared to million during the year ago period 
the amortization rate was approximately of the average msrs in both periods and reflected the then prevailing benign mortgage prepayment outlook 
the servicing portfolio grew to billion at february   a increase from the prior year 
the company has consistently grown its servicing portfolio over the years regardless of the market environment and largely through its own loan production efforts 
management believes that organic servicing portfolio growth is the key measure of economic value growth within its mortgage banking business 
closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies that provide credit reports  appraisals  title reports  and flood inspections primarily to the loan production sector but increasingly to third parties as well 
the company s integration of these previously out sourced services has not only provided incremental profits but also increased overall levels of service 
combined  the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  a increase over the year ago period 
this increase is noteworthy in light of the relatively flat growth in the company s loan originations over the same period 
the increase was driven by significant productivity improvements in the title and credit reporting operations  as well as to increased penetration of its captive customer base

gain on sale of loans is summarized below for the ten months ended december  and ten months ended december ten months ended dollar amounts in thousands  december  prime credit quality  first lien mortgages  sub prime mortgages  home equity mortgages  capital markets  in general  loan origination fee revenue and gain on sale of loans are affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans produced and sold  origination and sale channel mix  the level of price competition  and changes in interest rates

custodial balances increased due to increased payoff activity this occurs because  depending upon the payoff date and the investor servicing agreement  the company holds the payoff funds for periods ranging from two to calendar days 
the company is obligated to pass through a portion of the payoff float benefit to certain mortgage backed security mbs holders at security rates  which were significantly higher than the short term rates earned by the company 
interest expense from mortgage related investments in the loan servicing sector decreased primarily from a decline in short term rates  partially offset by an increase in the amounts financed 
the increase in net interest earned on the capital markets net trading portfolio is due to increased trading activity and a relatively steep yield curve in the ten months ended december   resulting in increased average balances and improved margins 
the increase in net interest margins from banking operations was primarily attributable to growth in warehouse lending activity 
the company recorded msr amortization for the ten months ended december  totaling million compared to million for the ten months ended december  the company recorded msr impairment of  million for the ten months ended december  compared to impairment of million for the ten months ended december  the primary factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment or impairment recovery of msrs recorded in an accounting period are the level of prepayments during the period and the change  if any  in estimated future prepayments 
in addition  the company recorded impairment of other retained interests of million and million for the ten months ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in impairment of other retained interests in the current period was due primarily to increased actual and anticipated prepayment speeds 
the company s servicing hedge is intended to reduce the impact on reported earnings due to changes in the value of the company s investment in msrs and other retained interests that generally result from changes in interest rates 
the company recognized net gains of million and million from the servicing hedge for the ten months ended december  and december   respectively 
in addition  the company recorded unrealized gains of million and million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the available for sale securities included in its servicing hedge for the ten months ended december  and  respectively 
the financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge included options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate swaptions  interest rate floors  interest rate caps  interest rate swaps  and principal only securities 
with respect to the floors  options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate caps and swaptions  the company is not exposed to loss beyond its initial outlay to acquire the hedge instruments plus any unrealized gains recognized to date 
with respect to the interest rate swap contracts entered into by the company as of december   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual terms is million

this increase was due to a significant increase in production volume and to growth in the loan servicing portfolio 
to a lesser extent  increased activity in the diversified businesses  including consolidation of a previously non consolidated european mortgage banking joint venture  also contributed to the increase in salaries 
incentive bonuses earned during the ten months ended december  increased primarily due to an increase in production volume  additional commissioned sales personnel in the loan production sector of the mortgage banking segment and increased trading activity in the capital markets segment 
occupancy and other office expenses for the ten months ended december  increased primarily due to growth in the loan production sector of the mortgage banking segment and  to a lesser extent  to growth in the diversified businesses segment 
the company uses temporary staffing to support production levels during periods of significant increases in production volume 
therefore  million of the increase in occupancy and other office expenses is due to the company s strategy of using temporary staffing instead of increasing its permanent staffing levels during periods of peak loan origination volume 
marketing expenses for the ten months ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the ten months ended december  the decline reflects the overwhelming customer demand for mortgage loans during the recent period 
insurance net losses are attributable to insurance claims in the insurance segment 
insurance losses were million or of insurance segment revenues  for the ten months ended december  as compared to million and of insurance segment revenues  for the ten months ended december  the level of losses recognized in a period is dependent on many factors  a primary driver being the occurrence of natural disasters

professional fees increased primarily due to increased costs arising from the company s growth and diversification efforts 
bad debt expense increased during the period primarily due to seasoning of previous years growth and to aging of the servicing portfolio 
bad debt expense consists primarily of losses arising from unreimbursed servicing advances  losses arising from repurchased or indemnified loans  and credit losses arising from va guaranteed loans

the increase in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was primarily due to an increase in the short term interest rates and an increase in the average custodial balances 
the increase in net interest income from the investments in the insurance segment was primarily due to the acquisition of balboa on november  the increase in interest expense related to the servicing sector resulted primarily from an increase in amounts financed coupled with an increase in short term interest rates 
the company recorded msr amortization for fiscal totaling million compared to million for fiscal the company recorded msr impairment of million for fiscal compared to recovery of previous impairment of million for fiscal the primary factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment or impairment recovery of msrs recorded in an accounting period are the level of prepayments during the period and the change  if any  in estimated future prepayments

see the credit risk section for further discussion 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  the company manages this risk by striving to balance its loan production sector with its loan servicing sector  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company utilizes various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  trading securities  mbs held for sale  msrs  and other retained interests as well as a portion of its debt 
the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the impact on reported earnings caused by changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
the following describes the various hedges in place which are used to manage interest rate risk 
servicing hedge the company maintains a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivatives  that are expected to increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
the servicing hedge includes options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate swaptions  interest rate floors  interest rate caps  interest rate swaps  and principal only securities 
this hedge is intended to reduce the impact on reported earnings due to changes in the value of the company s investment in msrs and other retained interests that generally result from changes in interest rates 
should interest rates increase  the value of the msrs is expected to increase while the value of the servicing hedge is expected to decline 
hedge of committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory countrywide hedges its inventory of loans and mortgage backed securities held for sale with forward contracts for the sale of loans and net sales of mbs  including options to sell mbs where the company can exercise the option on or before the anticipated settlement date of the mbs 
the company has additional interest rate exposure related to its committed pipeline due to the variability of closings  which is driven primarily by the direction of mortgage rates 
the company s hedging policies require that substantially all of the committed pipeline be hedged with a combination of options for the purchase and sale of mbs and treasury futures and forward contracts for the sale of mbs 
the company uses sophisticated software to estimate the amount and timing of applications that will close based upon potential interest rate movements  the source of the applications  and their aging 
the company updates its estimates of expected closings and adjusts its holdings of associated hedging instruments on a daily basis 
the company is generally not exposed to significant losses nor will it realize significant gains related to its inventory or committed pipeline due to changes in interest rates  net of gains or losses on associated hedge positions 
the correlation between the inventory  the committed pipeline and the associated hedge instruments is very high due to their similarity 
however  the company is exposed to the risk that the actual closings in the committed pipeline may deviate from the estimated closings for a given change in interest rates 
although mortgage rates are the primary determinant  actual loan closings from the committed pipeline are influenced by many factors  including the composition of the committed pipeline and remaining commitment periods 
the company s estimated closings are primarily based on recent empirical data 
trading portfolio activities countrywide manages interest rate risk in its broker dealer trading portfolio by entering various hedging transactions 
the company s trading portfolio is held to meet anticipated customer demand and not for speculative purposes 
the company s risk policy with respect to its trading portfolio is to remain price neutral 
trading portfolio hedging transactions vary based upon the instrument held  but can include forward sales  purchases of futures contracts  and various forms of swap transactions 
the company employs a risk manager dedicated to monitoring trading activities  including daily risk positions and compliance with established trading limits for individual traders 
debt securities the company determines the optimal mix of debt fixed rate vs 
variable rate as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps may be used to cost effectively achieve the optimal mix 
typically  the terms of the swap match the terms of the debt resulting in an effective conversion of the debt rate 
during the period ended december   the company elected to fix a significant portion of its outstanding debt and to issue new fixed rate debt  due to the historically low levels of interest rates 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net portfolio value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the company performs various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate scenarios including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments 
for mortgage loans  mbs and mbs forward contracts and collateralized mortgage obligations  an option adjusted spread model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
msrs and residual interests are valued using zero volatility discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates  ancillary income and credit losses 
utilizing the sensitivity analyses described above  as of december   the company estimates that an immediate reduction in interest rates  all else being constant  would result in a million after tax loss related to its msr s and other financial instruments there would be no loss related to its trading securities as of december   management estimates that an immediate reduction in interest rates is the largest reasonably possible change that could occur 
therefore  management is of the opinion that the after tax loss of million is the largest reasonably possible loss that might occur due to changes in market conditions as of december  these sensitivity analyses are limited by the fact that they are performed at a particular point in time  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such a scenario 
consequently  the preceding estimate should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
foreign currency risk an additional  albeit less significant  market risk facing the company is foreign currency risk 
the company has issued foreign currency denominated medium term notes see note of the accompanying financial statements 
the company manages the foreign currency risk associated with such medium term notes by entering currency swap transactions 
the terms of the currency swaps effectively translate the foreign currency denominated medium term notes into united states dollars  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk subject to the performance of the various counterparties to the currency swaps 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the mortgage banking and capital markets segments 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancings 
although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stimulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan production  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting primarily from over capacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  loan servicing earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and thus reducing amortization and impairment of the msrs  and because the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having a note rate higher than the prevailing mortgage rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting loan servicing sector earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the msrs  as well as impairment of other retained interests 
the servicing hedge is designed to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated earnings 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in mortgage rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months 
liquidity and capital resources the company has significant short term and long term financing needs 
principal short term financing needs arise from the warehousing of mortgage loans pending sale and the trading activities of the broker dealer 
the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests  and the hedging instruments associated with those investments  create the primary need for long term financing 
the company meets its financing needs primarily through the public corporate debt markets 
most commonly  the company issues commercial paper and medium term notes 
in the past  the company also has issued subordinated debt  convertible debt  and trust preferred securities 
the company uses the public corporate debt markets because it is the most efficient and cost effective means of raising capital  owing to its depth and breadth 
the company s ongoing access to the public corporate debt markets is dependent on high credit standing  as primarily evidenced by its credit ratings 
the company has consistently maintained solid investment grade ratings for the last ten years 
chl  the company s primary issuer of public corporate debt  presently has long term ratings of a a a as rated by standard poor s  moody s investors service  and fitch  inc  respectively 
over that period  there has been no significant disruption in the company s access to the public corporate debt markets 
among other things  maintenance of investment grade ratings requires high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand by lines of credit  as well as a capital structure that makes conservative use of financial leverage 
the company currently has secured and unsecured committed bank lines of credit and reusable mortgage purchase commitments totaling billion 
the company ensures that its outstanding commercial paper does not at any time exceed the unused portion of these facilities 
to further manage its liquidity  the company strives to maintain additional unused amounts within its lines to meet its expected operational cash requirements  including debt maturities  for the succeeding six months with a cushion for unanticipated cash needs 
a substantial portion of the company s assets are highly liquid in nature for example  mortgage loans and mbs held for sale  and trading securities 
the company s policy is to finance of its non liquid assets such as msrs and other retained interests with long term capital equity and debt with maturities greater than six months 
the company has established internal guidelines for financial leverage by business segment 
these guidelines primarily take into account the nature of each segment s major assets 
for example  the loan production and capital markets segments have assets that are highly liquid and short term in nature  as reflected in the company s current financial leverage ratio debt equity targets of and  respectively 
on the other hand  the loan servicing sector contains msrs and other retained interests that are generally perceived by the rating agencies and others to have significant inherent risks  despite the company s successful and ongoing risk management practices 
this results in the need to maintain a high percentage of equity capital to finance these investments in order to maintain the company s high credit standing 
the company s current financial leverage ratio target for the loan servicing sector is management believes the amount of equity capital required to finance its msrs and other retained interests is high relative to its major competitors  and such requirement increases the overall cost of capital for the company 
in addition to internal leverage guidelines  the company periodically performs value at risk var calculations and other analyses to demonstrate the adequacy of its capital 
these var calculations attempt to derive the probability distribution of investment losses driven by certain external factors  such as changes in interest rates 
the company s primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
the company has outstanding million in trust preferred securities that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  banks  and regulators 
in addition  the company currently has a billion deferred tax liability that  from a creditor s viewpoint  would serve to defray losses in a manner similar to equity 
from time to time  the company does engage in stock offerings as a means of supplementing its capital base and to support growth 
the company maintains an open dialogue and meets at least annually with each rating agency to review the company s performance and outlook 
issues of concern to one or more rating agency in the past have included the company s significant investment in retained interests  its involvement in sub prime lending  as well as its liquidity and capital structure 
management believes it has adequately addressed such concerns and that its ratings are stable 
however  the rating agencies could lower the company s credit ratings in the future 
in the unlikely event the company s credit ratings were to drop below investment grade  its access to the public corporate debt markets would be severely limited 
the company would have to rely upon alternative sources of financing such as bank lines and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  the company would likely be unable to retain all of its existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  its cost of financing would rise significantly and it may have to curtail some of its capital intensive activities  such as its ongoing investment in msrs and other retained interests 
the company would likely be able to arrange secured financing for its mortgage loan inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for the company to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
however  as previously stated  management believes its present ratings are stable and that a ratings downgrade to below investment grade in the foreseeable future is unlikely 
the company also places great reliance on the secondary mortgage market 
substantially all mortgage loans produced by the company are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities  as well as on a whole loan basis 
the majority of the mbs sold by the company are guaranteed by either fannie mae  freddie mac  or the government national mortgage association gnma collectively  agency mbs 
non agency or private label mbs and asset backed securities are also issued by the company 
private label mbs and asset backed securities are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
generally private label mbs and asset backed securities require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior sub structures  primary mortgage insurance  company guarantees  and or private surety guarantees 
the agency mbs market is extremely liquid 
the private label mbs market  particularly the sub prime mbs market  is significantly less liquid  although the company has enjoyed essentially uninterrupted access to those markets  albeit at varying costs 
the company ensures its ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
as described elsewhere in this document  quality assurance is a major focus of management and the company makes significant investments in personnel and technology in this regard 
as part of its mortgage securitization activities  the company acquired a reusable billion commitment from a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit to purchase loans in process of being pooled into agency mbs from the company 
the company has another such billion commitment in place to sell delinquent fha and va loans that have been removed from agency mbs pending foreclosure and liquidation 
the company utilizes these facilities from time to time primarily for liquidity management purposes 
the private label securitizations and committed purchase facilities discussed above are conducted through wholly owned special purpose entities spes that facilitate the securitization of mortgage loans 
in connection with these securitization transactions  the loans are either sold directly to the spe or to a trust through an spe 
the trust issues beneficial interests in the form of securities that are sold to investors 
the company does not carry contractual obligations related to these spes or the loans sold to them  except for the standard representations and warranties made in connection with private label securitizations 
the company retains servicing on the loans sold to these trusts and periodically retains an interest in the form of interest only strips  principal only securities  and residuals  which the company generally holds as long term investments 
in addition  the company may issue a corporate guarantee for losses up to a contractually specified amount 
the spes  while owned by the company  are generally controlled by a third party trustee for the benefit of unaffiliated beneficial holders 
in addition  the activities of the spes are limited 
for these reasons  among others  the accounting literature requires the exclusion of these spes from the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company also utilizes short term repurchase agreements as a means of financing securities and loans pending sale  as well as csc s securities trading portfolio 
although uncommitted and short term in nature  this method of financing has proven very reliable and cost effective 
management intends to significantly increase the size of treasury bank over the next three years to a targeted total asset size of billion 
management intends to realize this goal by utilizing countrywide s loan origination platform so that the bank can originate loans for the bank s investment portfolio 
funding for this growth will come from a variety of sources  including transfers of impound accounts controlled by chl  secured advances from the federal home loan bank  and from retail deposits generated from the company s customer base and elsewhere 
cash flows operating activities 
for the ten months ended december   the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion to support increases in mortgage loan inventory  csc s trading portfolio  other financial instruments purchased or retained related to loan sales and servicing activities  and an increase in other assets 
for fiscal  operating activities used cash of approximately billion 
investing activities 
the primary investing activity for which cash was used by the company was the investment in msrs and available for sale securities 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for the ten months ended december  and billion for fiscal financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for the ten months ended december  and billion for fiscal the increase in cash flow from financing activities was primarily used to fund the company s investment in inventory  msrs and available for sale securities and the increase in trading securities and other financial instruments 
prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of seven percent 
management believes that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market  and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support similar growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the on going developments in the mortgage market include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth of home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance  and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
the mortgage lending industry has undergone rapid consolidation in recent years  due to several factors 
first  the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market has caused mortgages to become more commodity like 
second  the ever increasing regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in significant costs and the need for higher levels of specialization 
third  interest rate volatility has risen markedly over the last decade 
at the same time  mortgagors propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased significantly 
the combined result has been relatively huge swings in the volume of loans originated from year to year 
these factors overall have dramatically increased the level of complexity in the business 
to operate profitably in this new environment requires lenders to have a very high level of operational and risk management skills  as well as technological expertise 
in addition  the business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital is critical 
as a result  large  sophisticated financial institutions currently dominate the mortgage industry 
these are primarily commercial banks  through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
today  the top twenty five lenders combined have a share of the mortgage origination market  up from four years ago 
according to the trade publication inside mortgage finance  the top five lenders and their respective market shares in were as follows institution market share wells fargo home mortgage chase home finance washington mutual countrywide bank of america mortgage total for top five management believes the consolidation trend in the mortgage market will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
the company believes it will benefit from this trend through increased market share 
in addition  management believes that irrational price competition which from time to time has plagued the industry in the past should lessen in the future 
housing appreciation housing values affect the company in several ways increasing housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing  increased average loan balances  and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults and the company is required to absorb all or a portion of the resulting loss 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index 
furthermore  the housing affordability index is at near historic highs 
consequently  management expects housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming year than in the past several years 
over the long term  management expects housing price index and consumer price index to be closely correlated 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which the company operates have an impact on the activities in which the company may engage  how the activities may be carried out  and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent the company is able to operate profitably 
for example  proposed state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories  thereby resulting in a reduction of otherwise legitimate sub prime lending opportunities 
similarly  certain proposed state and federal privacy legislation  if passed  could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to cross sell the non mortgage products offered by countrywide s various divisions to its customer base in a cost effective manner 
mortgage originations following is the estimated total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years united states mortgage calendar year originations billions source mortgage bankers association forecasters put the market for at between trillion and trillion 
although such a market would represent a significant decline from s historic level  it would still be a highly favorable market for the company s loan production business and would place continuing  although lessening  pressure on its loan servicing business due to continuing higher than normal mortgage loan prepayment activity 
over the long term  management expects the originations market to grow steadily  albeit at a lower absolute level  propelled by growth in the housing market and in the housing price index 
refinances  which in represented over of mortgage originations  are expected over the long term to represent to of total market originations 
credit risk in its mortgage banking operations  the company generally securitizes and sells all of the loans it originates or purchases 
conforming conventional loans are generally pooled by the company and exchanged for securities guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
substantially all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold  on a non recourse basis  subject to certain representations and warranties on the part of the company  whereby foreclosure losses are generally absorbed by fannie mae and freddie mac and not the company 
the company also sells its non conforming conventional loan production on a non recourse basis 
these loans are sold either on a whole loan basis or in the form of private label securities which generally require the company to provide some form of credit enhancement  such as insurance  third party payment guarantees or senior subordinated structures 
the company securitizes its fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans through gnma  fannie mae  or freddie mac 
the company is insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
the company is exposed to credit losses to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
the expected credit losses related to va guaranteed mortgage loans is included in the valuation of the related msrs 
while the company does not generally retain primary credit risk with respect to the prime credit quality  first lien mortgage loans it sells  it does have potential liability under the representations and warranties it makes to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  the company may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the investor or insurer 
if the company is required to repurchase the mortgage loan or indemnify the investor or insurer  any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan will be borne by the company 
home equity and sub prime loans are either sold on a whole loan basis or in the form of securities backed by pools of these loans 
when the company securitizes these loans  the company obtains an agency guarantee of timely and full payment of principal and interest  for which it pays a fee  or retains credit risk through retention of a subordinated interest or through a corporate guarantee of losses up to negotiated maximum amount 
the company s maximum exposure to losses as of the end of the period is limited to the carrying value of its subordinated interest million at december  or to the negotiated limit of reimbursable losses under its corporate guarantee million at december  less related recorded reserves million at december  
the carrying value of the subordinated interest includes  as a reduction in the anticipated cash flow  an estimate of losses 
management believes that the losses embedded in the subordinated interests and the liability recorded related to the corporate guarantees are adequate to cover anticipated credit losses 
the following table summarizes the credit losses incurred for the ten months ended december  dollar amounts in thousands ten months ended december  va losses in excess of va guarantee repurchased or indemnified loans subprime with retained residual interest home equity with retained residual interest subprime with mortgage insurance and limited corporate guaran tee the company has entered mortgage reinsurance agreements with several primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these agreements  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a pool of loans subject to a cap  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
approximately billion of the conventional servicing portfolio is covered by such mortgage reinsurance agreements 
management believes it has adequate reserves in place to cover anticipated losses 
the maximum exposure under these insurance contracts is limited to the trust assets held by second charter reinsurance company 
at december   the total assets held in trust were million 
prior to the sale of loans originated or purchased by the mortgage banking segment  the loans are included on the company s balance sheet as loans held for sale 
at december   loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory  the company bears credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance  which is generally required for conventional loans with loan to value greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
historically  credit losses related to loans held for sale have not been significant 
in addition  the company holds a small portfolio of loans for investment amounting to million at december  the company has retained credit risk on the remainder of this portfolio of loans 
management believes the allowance for loan losses related to these loans is adequate at december implementation of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  amended by statement no 
 deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to fasb statement no 
 collectively fas 
fas requires companies to record derivatives on their balance sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be reported in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of assets or liabilities or cash flows from forecasted transactions 
this statement was effective for the company on march  at the date of initial application  the company recorded certain transition adjustments as required by fas there was no impact on net income as a result of such transition adjustments 
however  such adjustments resulted in the company reducing the carrying amount of derivative assets by million and recognizing million of derivative liabilities on the balance sheet 
management believes that the company s hedging activities are highly effective over the long term
