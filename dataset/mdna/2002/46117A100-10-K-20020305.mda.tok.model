item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading provider of solutions that manage and deliver mission critical information for telecommunications providers and public safety organizations 
our customers include ilecs  clecs  wireless carriers and state and local governments in north america 
we manage the data that enables a call to be routed to the appropriate public safety agency with accurate and timely information about the caller s identification  callback number and location 
with our acquisition of lpss in may  we now provide supporting hardware and software technology  including the palladium call center and data management systems 
a number of telecommunications companies manage their infrastructure with these hardware and software systems 
in addition  these systems are used by public safety call centers across the nation to receive and respond to wireline and wireless e calls 
we generate revenue from four of our five segments  or business units ilec  clec  wireless and direct 
the revenue from these business units is derived from monthly data management services  maintenance  sales of systems and new products and professional services 
the following table represents revenue amounts and percentages by business unit year ended december  revenue percent ilec    clec    wireless    direct   historically  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from sales to customers in the united states 
however  we may attempt to enter international markets  which may require significant management attention and financial resources 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations regarding future revenue 
certain components of our revenue growth are difficult to forecast because the market for our services is evolving rapidly and the length of our sales cycle and the size and timing of significant customer contracts vary substantially 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected changes in operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
while preparing these financial statements  we made estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  capitalized software costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed and determinable delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
changes in either our underlying assumptions used to determine if the above criteria have been met or the vendor specific objective evidence obtained to support each of the above criteria  may result in the deferral of additional revenue and cost amounts associated with the specific contract performance elements noted above if the above criteria cannot be met on an ongoing basis 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december  we had over million of inventory related to the lpss acquisition 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we also capitalize certain software development costs related to significant new product offerings after technological feasibility is established and prior to general release 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market these software products  we may not recover the capitalized costs  thus resulting in potential write downs which may impact the profitability of future periods 
during the year ended december   we did not record an income tax benefit for any currently generated net operating loss carryforwards or net increases in deferred tax assets because we believe the criteria for recognition was not met 
we increased the valuation allowance to completely offset the increase in our net deferred tax assets 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the recorded amount  we will adjust the deferred tax asset and increase income during the period we made that determination 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  we will adjust the deferred tax asset and decrease income during the period we made that determination 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future net income for us federal income tax purposes

the obligation to purchase approximately million of inventory is payable in four equal installments beginning in august and ending in may and therefore  was discounted and recorded at million as of the date of the acquisition 
if any portion of the inventory is sold prior to may  a corresponding portion of the obligation would be due and payable immediately 
in january  lucent created a new venture capital partnership named new ventures partners ii lp nvp ii and transferred its shares of intrado common stock and its right to receive intrado preferred stock to nvp ii 
the actual amount of the preferred stock to be issued will be determined over a month contingency period that commenced on june  if total revenue  as defined in the purchase agreement  meets or exceeds million for that month period  then nvp ii is entitled to the full issuance of million in preferred stock 
if total revenue is greater than million  but less than million  nvp ii will be entitled to a pro rata issuance of preferred stock at a rate of  for each million dollars of total revenue in excess of million 
if we sell the call handling division to a third party during the month contingency period  the terms of the preferred stock will be adjusted as follows

the terms of the credit facility and lease line of credit also require us to maintain compliance with specified operating and financial covenants or ratios  including specified covenants and ratios related to leverage  which become more stringent over time 
if extraordinary business opportunities arise in the future  we may enter into discussions with third parties regarding potential equity investments and debt financing arrangements to satisfy actual or anticipated capital needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk to the extent that united states interest rates change 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
the interest payable on our line of credit is determined based on the prime rate plus per annum  and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on our capital lease lines are dependent on interest rates in effect at the time the lease line is drawn upon 
total liabilities outstanding at december  under the line of credit and capital lease lines were approximately million 
based on amounts borrowed as of december   we would have a resulting decline in future annual earnings and cash flows of approximately  for every increase in prime lending rates 
we have no plans to use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities
