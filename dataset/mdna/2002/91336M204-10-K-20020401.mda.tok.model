factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december   and our liquidity and capital resources 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report as well as the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
overview business we commenced operations in for the purpose of facilitating the provisioning  installation and servicing of dedicated communications circuits for service providers who buy network capacity and transport suppliers who sell network capacity 
monthly circuit access is provided under client contracts with terms ranging from to months  with a weighted average original length of months as of december  these client contracts are typically governed by master service arrangements  which contain certain service level guarantees that we maintain by providing continuous network monitoring  maintenance and restoration services to our clients 
clients may choose to terminate their agreement with us prior to the expiration of the contract 
in these cases  the master service agreement provides us the contractual right to bill clients for early termination costs up to of the remaining contract value at the time the circuit is cancelled by the client 
clients our clients are communications service providers and transport suppliers  such as internet service providers  or isps  competitive access providers  incumbent telecommunication service providers and other application and network service providers 
our services enable our clients to outsource the work of obtaining  installing and provisioning end to end circuits and managing these circuits and related vendor relationships 
our solutions seek to provide significant time  effort and cost savings to our clients  who would otherwise be forced to independently analyze the capacity  availability and pricing of circuit alternatives from multiple vendors 
in addition to the provisioning of new circuits  we encourage our clients to transfer or assign existing circuits to us that we then manage for and provide to our clients 
we refer to a transaction in which we contract with a client to take over an existing circuit during its existing contractual term as an assignment typically requiring consent of the carrier  whereas a similar arrangement where the original contract is out of term is referred to as a transfer 
we believe that by transferring and assigning circuits to us  our clients are able to improve efficiency  eliminate multi vendor management  streamline billing  obtain one call resolution of network issues and lower costs 
during the year ended december   uunet technologies a subsidiary of worldcom  abovenet communications mfn and bce nexxia corporation bce accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
mfn  worldcom  bce and allied riser operations represented   and  respectively  of our total revenues during the year ended december  mfn represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  we operate in a highly concentrated  high risk market  which has recently experienced a general deterioration of credit quality 
if one or more significant clients or a significant number of smaller clients are unable to meet their obligations to us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition  as would future deterioration in market conditions in our industry or in the creditworthiness of our significant clients or a significant number of smaller clients 
during the year ended december   several of our significant clients filed for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
in addition  one of our major clients has recently filed for bankruptcy and one other significant client has threatened to file for bankruptcy 
infrastructure in order to provision and manage dedicated circuits in an efficient and effective manner  we leverage our information and facilities infrastructure universal information exchange database 
as of december   our uix database contained over million data elements  including detailed information about the location  pricing  internal procurement processes and availability for over competing domestic and global transport suppliers in various geographic regions 
our uix database enables us to realize time and cost savings when analyzing the capacity  availability and pricing of circuit alternatives from multiple vendors 
the supply information that forms the core of our uix database is enhanced by the lattis tariff and pricing information we acquired through the purchase of tri quad enterprises 
we currently offer our clients subscriptions to receive the lattis tariff and pricing database via monthly cd rom updates 
these subscriptions did not contribute significantly to revenues during the years ended december   and  however we expect to continue to enhance the information and capabilities of the uix database and lattis on an ongoing basis  including our planned new web based tool 
universal transport exchange facilities 
the company s utx facilities are strategically located interconnection sites that interconnect multiple network service providers in order to accelerate the interconnection of circuits and optimize physical network configurations for enhanced profitability 
at december   we had nineteen utx facilities  two of which have not yet been placed into operations 
in selected markets  we anticipate deploying high speed  metropolitan fiber optic rings in conjunction with our utx facilities to further manage the cost and speed of connections to locations with significant connectivity demand 
although our utx facilities primarily support our circuit access services  we may lease space in our utx facilities to clients in limited instances 
circuit grooming we consider all circuits as being eligible for grooming 
as noted earlier  grooming involves circuit aggregation 
as our uix database continues to gather more information about our carriers networks  we expect to have greater insight into where and when our carriers networks can be optimized through their interconnection points to target additional business 
toward this end  our grooming strategy translates into our three initiatives financial grooming  which is targeted at generating sufficient volumes to warrant lower rate circuit costs from our carriers 
financial grooming typically involves negotiating carrier price reductions in exchange for volume commitments 
to date  the majority of our grooming benefits  which manifest themselves in improved margins  have been achieved through this approach 
physical grooming  which is achieved when two or more of our circuits have the same origination and termination points and we have the opportunity to aggregate circuits onto a higher capacity circuit 
physical grooming requires us to have the necessary information and capabilities to recognize where and when to secure higher capacity circuitry 
we took our first significant step toward physical grooming at the end of when we completed our new york city metro ring  which connects our three local utx sites using our optical switching equipment 
in the first quarter of  we realized initial grooming benefits from this initiative 
optimization is similar to physical grooming  but involves leveraging our carriers interconnection equipment capabilities as opposed to our own utx facilities 
as we take on more transfer and assignment business  we expect to have more opportunities to identify circuits eligible for grooming between carrier interconnection sites 
this would allow us to match client needs with carrier networks to the benefit of all parties 
all three grooming initiatives have been designed to enable us to maintain or increase margins on all existing circuits while also creating excess capacity with virtually no incremental operating cost 
the additional capacity created through grooming enables us to provide reduced provisioning times  circuit protection  disaster relief and additional service offerings 
we also expect significant secondary benefits because these initiatives should give us the ability to reduce our cost structure and enhance our ability to secure additional transfer and assignment business due to our increased capability to provide lower cost alternatives to clients 
on february  we agreed to acquire certain metropolitan  fiber optic ring and other assets of sphera optical networks to support the next phase of our grooming strategy to improve margins 
rather than building additional utx facilities in  we can place these assets into service immediately 
we expect to purchase seven of sphera s metro core optical rings  which are already interconnected with our utx facilities 
the acquisition is subject to bankruptcy court approval 
with the new rings  we would increase our interconnection facilities  adding active nodes to the network  which will act as extensions to our utx facilities 
the rings  located in new york city  new jersey  washington dc  virginia  dallas  chicago  and los angeles are positioned in high traffic cities for our clients 
a successful completion of the acquisition would accelerate the deployment of our grooming initiative 
our grooming strategy is not without certain elements of risk 
there is no guarantee that this strategy will be successful and that margins will improve 
as part of our ongoing business  we continue to be party to several long term revenue commitments with various vendors 
these contracts are based on projected new business volumes and if we are unable to meet our projections  our future margins and operating results will be impaired 
if it is determined that existing circuits cannot be groomed  we may not realize cost savings and margin improvements in the future as expected 
because these circuits can be long haul  local loop or end to end solutions  grooming must engage in an in depth analysis of all pieces of the circuits 
this analysis includes calculating the savings on the long haul circuit and weighing this against any cancellation or termination charges as well as any commitment shortfalls with that carrier 
for the local loops  new engineering may need to be created for at least one end of the loop 
additionally  grooming initiatives must consider factors such as account churn and other unfavorable contractual terms and conditions associated with carrier master service agreements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances and re evaluates these estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
reported results may differ from these estimates if different assumptions or conditions were to be made 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are those that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and that an understanding of these policies is important to a proper evaluation of our reported financial results revenue recognition  estimating accrued liabilities and allowances  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation and useful lives of long lived assets  and restructuring reserves 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenues from providing ongoing  dedicated circuit access  which includes network management and maintenance services 
circuit charges are billed monthly in advance  and circuit revenues are recognized in the month that service is provided so long as collectibility is reasonably assured 
we begin recognizing revenues from transfer or assignment of circuits once we begin providing all contractual services  including network management and monitoring services 
revenue earned by leasing utx facilities space to a client is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the lease 
these amounts did not contribute significantly to revenues during the years ended december   or amounts billed for installing a client circuit or installing client utx equipment are billed up front and recognized over the term of the related circuit access agreement 
these amounts did not contribute significantly to revenues during the years ended december   or once we disconnect a circuit and bill any applicable termination charges  we have no future obligations to the client 
we recognize revenue for the full amount of cancellation charges at the time that the charges are billed  so long as collectibility is reasonably assured 
while the imposition of these charges is provided for in our master service agreements  we have financial exposure in the event that the client defaults on the payment of these cancellation charges  since we will continue to be liable to the third party carriers from which we have bought network capacity to service such defaulting client 
such an event would result in lower realized margins 
in instances when collectibility is not reasonably assured at the time service is provided  we do not recognize revenue at the time the charges are billed  but record amounts billed as accounts receivable and increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record revenue for these amounts only when cash is ultimately received 
estimating accrued liabilities and allowances  including the allowance for doubtful accounts we perform routine credit analyses on new and existing clients based on financial statement analysis  cash position and credit risk in order to assess collectibility 
if events or circumstances occur subsequent to revenue recognition that indicate collection is no longer likely  we record bad debt expense at the time these events or circumstances become known 
during the year ended december   several of our significant clients filed for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
as a result of these developments  we significantly increased our allowance for doubtful accounts in each of the last three quarters of we continue to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance in light of continuing deterioration of market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate  however  actual experience could vary significantly from our estimates  which would adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition as would future deterioration in market conditions in our industry or the creditworthiness of our significant clients 
in addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts  the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of accrued liabilities 
we believe that amounts accrued at december  are reasonable  however  actual experience could vary significantly from our estimates  which would adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
valuation and useful lives of long lived assets utx facilities and equipment represent the majority of our long lived assets 
a utx facility is considered operational if there are at least five carriers in the facility  including both local and long haul carriers  six months have passed since the facility has been completed  or the facility generates  in monthly recurring revenues 
construction  equipment and facility leasing costs incurred in connection with the construction of a utx facility are capitalized until the facility is placed into operations 
once the facility is placed into operations  these costs are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease  ranging from seven to years  or the estimated useful life of the equipment 
as of december   we have invested a total of million in utx assets  including optical switching equipment and construction in process of million 
we have total open utx equipment purchase orders of approximately  and minimum lease payments of approximately million related to utx facilities 
although utx facilities and equipment represent the majority of our long lived assets  we have also invested in our uix database and office facilities and equipment 
we expect that amounts capitalized for our utx facilities and other long lived assets will be fully recoverable and we believe that our useful lives are reasonable 
however  changes in asset useful lives may result in a significant increase in depreciation expense or if we later determine that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable  we would recognize an impairment loss by reducing the carrying value of the long lived assets to their estimated fair value  which could materially impact our operating results 
restructuring reserves in the third quarter ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge 
estimates used to calculate these charges were provided in part by an outside real estate consulting firm and were based upon their estimate of the real estate market at the time of the restructuring 
as leases are disposed of or subleased in the future  actual timing and terms will likely be different  resulting in future adjustments to the restructuring charge 
in the case that we cannot sublease the facilities as expected  we could recognize a significant increase in future restructuring related rent expense 
other in september  we entered into our first successful portfolio management transaction  which included the assignment of circuits  new circuits and the rental of utx space 
in this transaction  a client assigned third party carrier circuits to us whereby we became the carrier of record on the assigned circuits  assuming full liability to third party carriers for the assigned circuits 
in an effort to encourage all parties to agree to this assignment  all billing disputes between the client and the third party carriers had to be resolved prior to the assignment of the circuits 
under the terms of the agreement  we advanced to the third party carriers the disputed amount of approximately million with recourse against both the third party carriers and the client once the disputes are resolved 
this amount is recorded as a non trade receivable in the current assets section of the balance sheet at december  to date  cost of circuit access has primarily consisted of amounts paid to transport suppliers for circuits 
we have negotiated volume discounts and network route specific discounts under contracts with many of our suppliers 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years and include minimum monthly purchase commitments that begin anywhere from six to twelve months after we enter into the contract 
during  we renegotiated our minimum purchase commitment with a significant supplier whereby our total revenue commitment decreased by million over the ten year life of the agreement 
at december   our minimum purchase commitments totaled approximately million per month 
however  actual purchases under these contracts  which totaled approximately million for the three months ended december   have exceeded total minimum purchase commitments 
in addition  as of december   we are party to contracts that will impose minimum purchase commitments that we anticipate will total approximately million per month by december we will continue to evaluate commitment agreements in the future for any adverse effects on the operations of the company  however  at this time we do not feel that any additional reserves are necessary 
during  we paid a supplier million in exchange for favorable pricing terms and will amortize this cost over the ten year life of the agreement 
operations and administration expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  costs associated with the development  expansion and maintenance of our uix database  and costs associated with sales  marketing  operations  administration and facilities 
in each year since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and net losses  and have experienced negative cash flows from operations 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss    dividends on redeemable and nonredeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock  net loss applicable to common stockholders   basic and diluted net loss per share shares used in computing net loss per share    results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit access revenues in each of these years 
our utx facilities enable us to provision circuits more quickly 
the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater revenues per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant contraction and restructuring over the past months 
as a result  there has been a significant increase in the number of bankruptcies among telecommunications service providers  carriers  isps and application service providers  or asps  and this trend may continue 
with a majority of our revenue coming from the telecommunications industry  management must continually assess the credit quality of our client base as well as the collectibility of the revenue expected from clients deemed high risk 
if significant amounts of revenues previously accrued or anticipated are ultimately not collected  we would be required to record additional bad debt expenses in the future which could materially impact our operating results 
in the fourth quarter of  we provided million of circuit access services to aleron  inc aleron 
also during the fourth quarter of  we agreed to purchase certain atm network equipment from aleron for million 
during january  we offset amounts due from aleron for circuit access services with the payable due to aleron related to our purchase of network equipment from aleron 
during  an executive officer of aleron was a member of our board of directors 
on march  aleron filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code  with outstanding amounts owed universal access of million  representing services incurred january through march  cost of circuit access cost of circuit access increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  cost of circuit access decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of circuit access was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold to both an increased number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the decrease in cost of circuit access as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to volume pricing efficiencies created by the scaling of our model and the growing efficiencies in our business driven by financial grooming as described above 
operations and administration excluding stock compensation operations and administration expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was in proportion with the scaling of the business 
as a percentage of total revenues  operations and administration expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  at december  we had full time employees and headcount remained in excess of through june  we reduced headcount to at september  as a result of our restructuring plan 
the cost of uix development personnel as well as non capitalized costs associated with the uix database increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  facilities costs  including rent and utilities for corporate offices and sales offices increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  bad debt expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  as a result of several of our significant clients filing for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
we also recorded an impairment charge of  related to the write down of certain assets  including goodwill and fixed assets  from our pcn division 
sales and marketing costs  primarily for tradeshows  advertising and promotions  decreased million for the year ended december  during  we began operations in london and amsterdam to increase our presence in europe 
we incurred a loss from these start up operations of million in and expect losses from our european operations to decrease in the future  as a result of our reductions in headcount and facilities that occurred during the third quarter of we expect total operations and administration expenses to decrease in absolute terms as well as a percentage of revenue from our annual average for as we realize efficiencies from our uix database  other corporate infrastructure projects and our recent restructuring efforts 
operations and administration stock compensation during fiscal year and the first quarter of  we granted stock options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the dates of grant 
these stock option issuances have resulted in stock compensation charges  which are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
stock compensation expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the substantial increase in stock compensation charges between periods is attributable to an million charge for options granted by universal access in september in exchange for cancellation of restricted stock that was granted to executives in january at per share 
in addition  we recognized an million charge for restricted stock issued by universal access in exchange for outstanding unexercised employee stock options having an exercise price of at least per share and for grants of restricted stock to certain employees 
a total of million restricted shares were issued under these grants in the fourth quarter of there were  and  stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively 
we expect to recognize additional stock compensation charges of approximately million over the next four years 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
depreciation expense increased by million in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  as a result of the company starting to depreciate eight additional utx facilities during the quarter ended june   and one utx facility during the quarter ended september   as well as additional equipment purchases for existing utx facilities 
we expect depreciation expense to increase in the future as we continue to place our remaining utx facilities into service and purchase additional equipment for existing utx facilities 
amortization expense  which increased  during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchases of stuff software and tri quad enterprises in november and july  respectively 
restructuring in the quarter ended september   the company recorded a charge of million for restructuring costs and asset impairments 
this charge was reduced by million in the quarter ended december  resulting in a net charge of million during the year ended december  based on the strategic direction of the company and the overall state of the telecommunications industry  management made the decision to restructure the company in an effort to remain on target to achieve the company s financial objectives and reduce administrative costs 
the primary aspects of the restructuring plan were a the company reduced the number of employees in all departments and reorganized departments to further enhance productivity  b based on the reduced number of employees and on operational projections  the company exited a variety of office facilities and one utx facility  c due to the reduced number of employees and the amount of space being vacated  the company wrote down fixed assets  such as computer equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements  and d the company wrote off the value of the investment it had made in a privately held company based on the fact that this company commenced liquidation proceedings during the third quarter 
the workforce reduction affected approximately employees or of june  worldwide employees 
the million restructuring charge reversal in the fourth quarter was primarily a result of the favorable outcome of lease negotiations with a landlord 
the following summarizes the significant components of the restructuring reserve original restructuring charge costs non cash incurred cash payments adjustments balance at december  severance and benefits   impairment of assets   facility exit costs  net of estimated sublease recoveries  other than temporary decline in fair value of long term investments other total      facility exit costs  the largest portion of the restructuring charge  represent rent payments that we are contractually obligated to pay through  net of estimated sublease recoveries totaling million 
the company expects to make cash outlays of million that will be charged against the restructuring reserve in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
we expect that all restructuring costs will be paid by during  we made an investment of million for an ownership interest of approximately in a non publicly traded company 
in august it was announced that the investee company commenced liquidation proceedings 
as a result  we determined that the investment was other than temporarily impaired and wrote the investment s carrying value down to zero and included the resulting loss in restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 
other income expense other income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and the decrease in other income was attributable to our lower cash and short term investment balances and decreases in interest rates 
we invested substantially all of the proceeds from our public stock offering during in cash equivalents with original maturities of less than three months and marketable securities with original maturities of three to six months 
interest income for the years ended december  and was partially offset by interest expense on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
income taxes from our inception through september   we elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for income tax purposes 
in september  we converted to a c corporation 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit has been recorded in our statement of operations 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis and adjust the valuation allowance based on this assessment 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards if there is a change in ownership  as defined  within any three year period 
the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to our capital stock transactions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit revenues in each of these years 
obtaining more carrier information with which we populated our uix database enabled us to provision circuits more efficiently and therefore directly contributed to increases in circuit revenues 
the increase in revenues was also attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater revenues per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
cost of circuit access cost of circuit access increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  cost of circuit access decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of circuit access was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold to both an increased number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the decrease in cost of circuit access as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to volume pricing efficiencies created by the uix database and reflects the successful scaling of our model and the growing efficiencies in our business 
operations and administration excluding stock compensation operations and administration expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in personnel  continued expansion of our uix database and the build out of our corporate infrastructure  including facilities  sales and marketing 
the number of employees increased from at december  to at december   which resulted in a significant increase in salaries and benefits expense during as a result of these significant headcount additions  we used external placement agencies to assist with our internal recruiting efforts  increasing placement fees by million to a total of million during the cost of uix development personnel as well as non capitalized development costs associated with the uix increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  facilities costs  including rent and utilities for corporate offices and sales offices increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to the write down of certain assets  including goodwill and fixed assets  from pcn 
sales and marketing costs  primarily for tradeshows  advertising and promotions  increased million for the year ended december  during  we began operations in london and amsterdam to increase our presence in europe  incurring a loss from these start up operations of million for the year ended december  operations and administration stock compensation during fiscal year and the first quarter of  we granted stock options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the dates of grant 
these stock option issuances resulted in stock compensation charges  which are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
stock compensation expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the substantial decrease in stock compensation charges between periods was attributable to loans issued to three officers of the company in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this event resulted in a one time stock compensation charge of million in the year ended december  there were  and  stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
depreciation expense increased by million in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  as a result of six additional utx facilities placed into operations during the fourth quarter of as well as additional equipment purchases for existing utx facilities 
amortization expense  which increased  during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchases of pacific crest networks  stuff software and tri quad enterprises in july  november and july  respectively 
other income expense other income totaled  and million for the years ended december  and december  the increase in other income was attributable to our investment of substantially all of the proceeds from our public stock offering in cash equivalents with original maturities of less than three months and marketable securities with original maturities of three to six months 
interest income for the year ended december  was partially offset by interest expense on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
income taxes at december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit was recorded in our statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of cash are to fund operating losses  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and opportunistic acquisitions 
our capital expenditures will be centered around the expansion of our two primary service elements  information and facilities 
for information  we will continue to seek out new data resources  particularly those needed to provision circuits outside the boundaries of the united states 
we also plan to invest in the development of our web based customer interface and portal which was described earlier and is envisioned as creating a competitive advantage for us in the quoting  pricing and provisioning of connectivity for our clients 
for facilities  we will continue to invest in our utx and metropolitan connectivity initiatives so as to create a competitive advantage in terms of service delivery  cost and pricing 
in addition  we would look to acquire distressed assets that are complementary to our business model 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used was primarily due to a decrease in operating loss before non cash items in as compared to net cash used in operating activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used was primarily due to increased net losses  including decreases in non cash stock compensation charges  and increases in working capital requirements 
during  a significant portion of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly  as a result of decrease in customer demand or decrease in the acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities relates to increased purchases of property and equipment  primarily for the construction of our utx facilities  and the purchase of tri quad enterprises in coupled with the sale of short term investments in net cash used in investing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities relates to the purchases of property and equipment  primarily for the construction of our utx facilities  and the purchase of tri quad and short term investments 
at december  we had nineteen utx facilities  two of which have not yet been placed into operations 
in we plan to spend approximately to million to complete construction of two utx facilities  support the continued enhancement of our uix  upgrade utx facilities for additional service demands and develop other product offerings 
this amount does not include any expenditures that may be made in connection with our planned acquisition of certain assets from sphera 
we will use part of the proceeds from our initial public stock offering  as well as proceeds from operations  and do not anticipate needing any additional outside funding in order to complete these projects 
in december  we purchased million of equipment for deployment in our utx facilities 
in march  approximately million of this equipment was paid for and deployed  and subsequently refinanced through a capital lease transaction in may  less approximately  in software that was purchased by us 
we returned the remaining undeployed equipment to the manufacturer in december based on deterioration in the telecommunications market  and in particular  the tightening in the availability of financing supported by telecommunications assets  we determined that the capital and related financing cost of acquiring additional equipment beyond the amount financed and deployed during the year was no longer justified 
a corresponding reduction in the accounts payable and related equipment was recorded 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from the initial public issuance of our common stock in march we have invested these proceeds primarily in cash equivalents  with original maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities  with original maturities of between three and six months 
we intend to continue investing surplus cash in similar securities  however  we may invest in marketable securities with maturities of up to eighteen months 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from the public issuance of our common stock on march  we have invested these proceeds primarily in cash equivalents  with original maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities  with original maturities of between three and six months 
in january  the company added  shares to its stock plan 
in accordance with this plan  a maximum number of  shares of our common stock may be optioned and sold  plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of our fiscal year beginning in equal to the lesser of i  shares  ii of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date  or iii a lesser amount determined by the board 
in january  we added  shares to our employee stock purchase plan 
in accordance with this plan  a maximum number of  shares of our common stock may be sold  plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of our fiscal year beginning in equal to the lesser of i  shares  ii of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date  or iii a lesser amount as determined by the board 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank under which we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
the agreement expires in june and supersedes the credit agreement entered into in june the agreement consists of part a and part b 
under part a of the agreement we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
part a requires that we maintain a cash balance in a custodial account in an amount equal to the amount of borrowings and letters of credit outstanding up to million 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under part a of the agreement as of december  under part b of the agreement we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
part b requires that we maintain a cash balance in a custodial account in an amount equal to the amount of borrowings and letters of credit outstanding up to million 
letters of credit totaling  were outstanding under part b of the agreement as of december  a cash balance of million was held in a custodial account as of december  to cover part a and b of the facility 
in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
net proceeds related to this offering totaled million 
until the time of our initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through private placements as well as through borrowings from stockholders and financial institutions 
since inception through december   we raised million in capital through private placements of common and convertible preferred stock and common and preferred stock warrants 
in december  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank and borrowed million 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at approximately and are secured by specifically identified assets 
the agreement expires in november and requires that we maintain an unrestricted cash balance of at least million 
as of december   the outstanding balance of this loan was million 
in march  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank under which we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
the agreement provides that outstanding borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
this agreement expired in april  and we did not renew this line of credit 
the collateral cash balance in the amount of our outstanding letters of credit at december  was  and expired april  financial position as of december   we had a net financial position cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net of term loans and capital lease obligations of million 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
term loans and capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases incl 
restructured facilities non cancelable purchase commitments total thereafter    although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our business until we become self funding through operations  our ability to meet our planned growth may require substantial cash resources 
we expect that our anticipated funding of negative cash flow from operating activities will require capital 
in addition  part of our expansion strategy includes acquiring complementary businesses and technologies  which may require us to raise additional funds 
we do not expect to generate cash flow from operations in the near term that is sufficient to meet our planned cash requirements 
accordingly  our ability to meet our additional future capital needs will depend upon our ability to renegotiate  extend or replace our credit facilities  obtain supplemental financing or raise additional capital 
additional debt financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
we may not be able to renegotiate or replace our credit and equipment lease facilities on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
additional equity financing may not be available or may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain future financing when needed or on acceptable terms  we may have to delay or abandon our development and expansion plans  which could materially adversely affect our growth and ability to compete 
in february the company engaged an investment bank to assist the company in a potential issuance of up to million in new equity for other than working capital needs 
in march  the company suspended efforts in connection with the potential offering 
the company may  depending on market conditions  seek to raise additional capital during this year

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
became effective for universal access as of january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k and our other reports filed with the sec  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception  and if we fail to increase our revenues  we will be unable to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have grown from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  we cannot be certain that our revenues will continue to grow  or that we will achieve sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we expect to continue to incur increasing expenses in order to expand sales and marketing activities to increase market acceptance  expand and enhance our uix database  and build out our utx facilities 
as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we fail to generate higher revenues  we may continue to incur operating losses and net losses 
our limited operating history makes forecasting difficult 
we have a limited operating history and  therefore  limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base our planned operating expenses 
specifically  our utx business model is relatively new  and we have not operated our uix database in conjunction with our utx facilities long enough to accurately predict trends in our business 
moreover  we have not built out enough utx facilities for a long enough period of time to be able to test whether our strategy to utilize these facilities will work 
accordingly  we are subject to all of the risks that are associated with companies in an emerging industry and in an early stage of development  including undercapitalization  cash shortages  the unproven nature of our business model  the new and unproven nature of the market for our services  the need to make significant expenditures and incur significant expenses as we develop our business  infrastructure and operations  the lack of sufficient clients and revenues to sustain our operations and growth without additional financing  difficulties in managing growth  and limited experience in providing some of the services that we offer or plan to offer 
for example  from time to time we enter into long term agreements with communications transport suppliers for the supply and installation of communications network capacity 
these agreements generally provide for monthly minimum revenue commitments from us  which we must negotiate based on forecasts of our future network capacity requirements 
as of december   we were party to contracts that will impose minimum purchase commitments that we anticipate will total approximately million per month by december if we fail to forecast our network capacity requirements accurately or fail to accurately forecast other aspects of our business  it will be difficult for us to become profitable 
we have an unproven business model  and we cannot be sure that clients will widely accept our services 
our business strategy is unproven 
to be successful  we must convince prospective clients to entrust their network capacity data and transport requirements to a company without a long and proven track record 
we are not aware of any companies that have a directly comparable business  and we cannot be sure that clients will widely accept our services 
our ability to expand our client base may be limited by the following factors the speed  reliability and cost effectiveness of our services  the willingness of clients to outsource the obtaining of circuits  our ability to market our services effectively  and the growth of the internet 
we may not be able to execute our business model if the markets for our services fail to develop or grow more slowly than anticipated  if competitors enter the market or if we are unable to expand our client base 
our ability to implement and maintain our uix database is unproven 
if we cannot increase the scope and accuracy of these databases as planned  our ability to cost effectively facilitate the obtaining of circuits for our clients will be at risk 
to be successful  we must increase and update information about pricing  capacity  availability and location of circuits contained in our databases 
our ability to cost effectively facilitate the supplying of circuits and to provide ongoing dedicated line circuit access depends upon the information we collect from our transport suppliers regarding their networks  which we include in our uix database 
our suppliers are not obligated to provide us with this information and could decide to stop providing this information to us at any time 
moreover  we cannot be certain that the information that our suppliers share with us is completely accurate or current 
if we cannot continue to maintain and expand our uix database as planned  we may be unable to increase our revenues or to cost effectively facilitate the supplying of the circuits  and we may never achieve profitability 
the market for our utx services is new and unproven  and we have limited experience providing our utx services 
the market for our utx services is new and unproven 
our ability to generate revenues will suffer if the market for these services fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we expect 
the growth of this market depends on several uncertain events or occurrences including our ability to remain a neutral intermediary between transport suppliers and the willingness of these suppliers to install their equipment in our utx facilities  our ability to successfully and cost effectively market our services to a sufficiently large number of clients  and the increased need for high speed communications network services 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from providing on going circuit access  and we have only limited experience providing our utx services 
at december   we had operational utx facilities in atlanta  boston  chicago  dallas  los angeles locations  miami locations  new york city locations  phoenix  portland  san francisco  seattle  washington dc  and vienna  virginia 
however  clients may terminate their utx contracts at any time  and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we fail to maintain our existing clients and to attract new clients for our utx services 
one of our key strategies is to expand our business by opening additional utx facilities in geographically diverse locations 
construction or acquisition of utx facilities is expensive and time consuming and will cause a significant strain on the capital resources and operation of our business 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient funds  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans 
a delay in the expansion of our utx facilities may make it more difficult for us to respond to competitive pressures and establish our presence in the market 
it usually takes us at least six months to select an appropriate location for a new utx facility  construct the facility  install equipment and communications network infrastructure and hire operations and sales personnel 
we must incur these costs before we have clients who purchase our services to be delivered from the utx facilities 
if the demand does not develop as we anticipate  we will have fixed costs without corresponding revenue and our business will be harmed 
our ability to open utx facilities is subject to a number of risks  including the following the availability of appropriate space for these facilities on reasonable terms  competition for limited space in desirable locations from large  well capitalized companies that may be more attractive tenants for potential landlords  construction delays  cost overruns  equipment and material delays  and inability to obtain necessary permits on a timely basis 
in addition  our costs will increase as we continue to open utx facilities 
these increased costs include leasing additional real estate  expenses associated with hiring  training and managing new employees  purchasing new equipment  implementing power and redundancy systems  implementing multiple communications connections  and depreciation expense 
an inability to establish additional utx facilities as planned  to effectively manage our expansion or to attract sufficient clients to our utx facilities would harm our ability to generate revenues 
if we cannot successfully aggregate circuits  this could limit our ability to increase our margins 
we plan to actively manage circuits through our utx facilities to deliver circuits to clients more quickly and to increase margins 
we plan to achieve this by physically aggregating circuits on the same route 
in order to physically aggregate circuits  we have on a limited basis  deployed optical switches that would allow circuits to be optically switched between networks 
we may continue to face delays in installing optical switches 
in addition  we cannot be sure that there will be enough circuits on routes between existing utx facilities to allow us to cost effectively aggregate these circuits 
if we cannot successfully deploy optical switches or physically aggregate circuits  this could limit our ability to increase our margins 
deterioration in credit quality may affect our clients ability to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner or at all 
we operate in a highly concentrated  high risk market  which has recently experienced a general deterioration of credit quality 
credit quality concerns  which have historically affected smaller network service providers and subsequently smaller telecommunications providers  have more recently impacted  and continue to impact  larger telecommunications providers and carriers 
during the year ended december   several of our significant clients filed for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
in addition  one of our major clients has recently filed for bankruptcy and one other significant client has threatened to file for bankruptcy 
as a result  some of our clients may have inadequate financial resources to meet all of their obligations 
if either significant clients or a significant number of smaller clients are unable to meet their obligations to us  we may incur additional bad debt expenses and reduced opportunities for growth  which could harm our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition as would future deterioration in market conditions in our industry or in the creditworthiness of our significant clients or a significant number of smaller clients 
we may require additional third party financing  and if we cannot obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to expand our business may suffer 
although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our business until we become self funding through operations  our ability to meet our planned growth may require substantial cash resources 
we expect that our anticipated funding of negative cash flow from operating activities will require capital 
in addition  part of our expansion strategy includes acquiring complementary businesses and technologies  which may require us to raise additional funds 
we do not expect to generate cash flow from operations in the near term that is sufficient to meet our planned cash requirements 
accordingly  our ability to meet our additional future capital needs will depend upon our ability to renegotiate  extend or replace our credit facilities  obtain supplemental financing or raise additional capital 
additional debt financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
we may not be able to renegotiate or replace our credit and equipment lease facilities on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
additional equity financing may not be available or may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain future financing when needed or on acceptable terms  we may have to delay or abandon our development and expansion plans  which could materially adversely affect our growth and ability to compete 
if we cannot successfully operate our network operations center  we will be unable to provide monitoring  maintenance and restoration services to our clients 
one of our primary business objectives is to provide our clients with network monitoring  maintenance and restoration services hours a day  seven days a week through a network operations center 
while we currently operate our own network operations facility  our experience in this regard is limited both by the amount of time we have been in business and providing this service on our own as well as by the technical limitations of managing circuits and services on the networks of other providers 
as a consequence  we cannot be sure that our efforts to provide these services will be successful 
our ability to implement this strategy will depend on many factors  including our ability to train  manage and retain employees 
if we fail to successfully operate a network operations center  we may not be able to monitor network operations effectively or troubleshoot circuits in a cost effective manner  which would cause us to lose clients and make it difficult for us to attract new clients 
competition in our industry is intense and growing  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for the services we provide is highly fragmented 
in addition  the market in which we operate is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we believe that at this time no single competitor competes directly with us with respect to all of the services we offer  however  we currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies  including some of our transport suppliers  with respect to our products and services individually  including national and local carriers  such as at t  broadwing  qwest  sprint  worldcom and williams communications  companies that provide collocation facilities  such as mfn  at t and equinix  companies that engage in bandwidth trading  resale  and arbitrage of circuit connectivity such as arbinet  bandwidth 
com and rateexchange  competitive access providers  such as at t  eli  icg communications  worldcom  xo communications  fibernet and telseon  and incumbent local exchange carriers  such as verizon  bellsouth and sbc communications 
we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants in the future as there are few substantial barriers to entry in our market 
significant new competitors could arise from increased consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry 
other new entrants could enter the market with a business model similar to ours 
our target markets may support only a limited number of competitors 
operations in such markets with multiple competitive providers may be unprofitable for one or more of such providers 
prices in both the long distance business and the data transmission business have declined significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
moreover  while recent regulatory initiatives allow carriers such as us to interconnect with incumbent local exchange carrier facilities and to obtain unbundled network elements from incumbent local exchange carriers  certain initiatives also provide increased pricing flexibility for  and relaxation of regulatory oversight of  the incumbent local exchange carrier 
this may present incumbent local exchange carriers with an opportunity to subsidize services that compete with our services with revenues generated from non competitive services 
this would allow incumbent local exchange carriers to offer competitive services at lower prices 
existing laws also restrict the regional bell operating companies from fully competing with us in the market for interstate and international long distance telecommunications services  but also permit the fcc to lessen or remove some restrictions 
verizon and sbc  two of the bell companies  have received fcc permission to offer long distance services to customers in a number of states  and the fcc is expected to consider several additional carriers for this relief over the coming year 
if fcc decisions under existing law  or future amendments to federal telecommunications laws  permit the regional bell operating companies to compete fully with us in this market  our revenues from these services could be reduced if these companies are able to attract a substantial portion of our clients 
we must distinguish ourselves through the quality of our client service  our service offerings and brand name recognition 
we may not be successful in doing this 
many of our potential competitors have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  including brand or corporate name recognition  larger client bases  longer operating histories  and more established relationships in the industry 
our competitors may be able to use these advantages to expand their offerings more quickly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  enter into strategic relationships to rapidly grow the reach of their networks and capacity  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services  and adopt more aggressive pricing and incentive policies  which could drive down margins 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  our gross margins could decline and we could lose market share  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we have difficulties or delays in delivering circuits to our clients  our ability to generate revenue will suffer and we may lose existing and potential new clients 
it typically takes to days to supply a circuit for a client  and we do not begin to recognize revenue until a circuit has been installed and accepted by the client 
once we agree to facilitate the supply of a circuit for a client  we negotiate with one or more transport suppliers and manage the personnel and field technicians of multiple vendors 
a client can withdraw its order with minimal liability at any time before accepting the circuit 
we may experience difficulties in facilitating the supply of circuits if our transport suppliers run out of capacity  forcing us to look for alternative sources of capacity on short notice 
if we are unable to facilitate the supply of a circuit in a timely manner or fail to obtain client acceptance of the circuit  we will be unable to recognize revenues for that circuit  and our operating results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  since our clients may cancel orders at any time before accepting the circuit  we may find it difficult to forecast revenue and plan our expenses accordingly 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which we cannot control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
these factors include the following uncertainty regarding timing for supplying circuits or failure to obtain client acceptance of circuits  timing of the completion of new utx facilities  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  decisions by existing clients not to renew services on a timely basis when existing client contracts terminate  the amount of unused circuit capacity that we hold  general economic conditions as well as those specific to the internet and related industries  internet growth and demand for internet infrastructure  and labor issues with our suppliers 
in addition  we depend on decisions by our clients to expand their internet infrastructure  which in turn depend upon the success and expected demand for the services these clients offer 
we expect our operating expenses to remain relatively constant or decline moderately in future periods 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term due in large part to our construction of our utx facilities 
as a result  fluctuations in our revenue for the reasons set forth above  or for any other reason  could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
because of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not  and will not be  a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock may fall 
our facilities and the networks on which we depend may fail  which would interrupt the circuit access we provide and make it difficult for us to retain and attract clients 
our clients depend on our ability to provide ongoing dedicated circuit access 
the operation of these circuits depends on the networks of third party transport suppliers  such as worldcom or williams communications 
the networks of transport suppliers and clients who may use our utx facilities may be interrupted by failures in or damage to these facilities 
our facilities and the ongoing circuit access we provide may be interrupted as a result of various events  many of which we cannot control  including fire  human error  earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  train derailments or similar disasters along communications rights of way  power loss  telecommunications failures  or sabotage or vandalism 
we may be subject to legal claims and be liable for losses suffered by our clients for disruptions to circuits or damage to client equipment resulting from failures at our facilities or on the networks of third party providers 
in addition  we may be subject to legal claims and be liable for losses suffered by clients and carriers who use our utx facilities 
our contracts with our clients and with carriers who use our utx facilities attempt to eliminate our liability for consequential or punitive damages and for damage to client equipment not caused by our gross negligence or willful acts 
however  those provisions may not protect us from being held liable for those damages 
we generally provide outage credits to our clients if circuit disruptions occur 
if our circuit failure rate is high  we may incur significant expenses related to circuit outage credits  which would reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we would also incur significant expenses in investigating and addressing the causes of such circuit failures  which would divert resources from the expansion of our services and cause our business to suffer 
clients may seek to terminate their contracts with us if there is a circuit failure 
in addition  if our circuit failure rate is high  our reputation could be harmed  which would make it difficult for us to retain and attract clients 
terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is affected by general economic conditions and fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
recent terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them  including future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or military or trade disruptions impacting our suppliers or our clients  may adversely impact our operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in the delivery of our service  decreased sales of our services and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our clients 
strategic targets such as communications networks and the sears tower may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the united states 
this occurrence could have an adverse impact on our operations 
it is possible that any or a combination of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on several large clients  and the loss of one or more of these clients  or a significant decrease in total revenues from any of these clients  could significantly reduce our revenue and income 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has come from a limited number of clients 
for example  for the year ended december   our largest client accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and for the year ended december   our four largest clients accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
in the year ended december  our three largest clients represented of total revenues 
we have a number of significant revenue contracts with these clients 
these contracts expire on various dates between now and march if we lose one or more large clients  or if one or more of our large clients reduces the services they purchase from us and we fail to add new clients  our revenues could decline and our results of operations would suffer 
the regulatory framework under which we operate and new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing regulatory requirements could require substantial time and resources for compliance  which could make it difficult for us to operate our business 
our communications services are subject to both federal and state regulation 
in providing our interstate and international communications services  we must comply with federal telecommunications laws and regulations prescribed by the fcc 
at the state level  we are subject to state laws and to regulation by state public utility commissions 
as we expand internationally  we will also become subject to regulation by foreign authorities and  in some markets  supra national authorities  such as the european union 
these laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes and different interpretations  and therefore  it is difficult for us to assess the impact of these factors on our operations 
the current domestic and international trend is toward deregulation of telecommunications and internet services 
however  we cannot be certain that this trend will continue  and it is possible that changes in regulatory policies could limit our ability to compete in some markets 
the implementation  modification  interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations vary and can limit our ability to provide many of our services 
we have been required to obtain authorization from the fcc and many state public utilities commissions to offer particular types of telecommunications services 
pursuant to these authorizations  we have to comply with a variety of regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis 
we cannot assure you that the fcc or state commissions will grant us required authority or do so in a timely manner  or refrain from taking action against us if we are found to have violated any requirements of their rules 
if authority is not obtained or if our schedules of prices  terms  and conditions are not filled  or are not updated  or otherwise do not fully comply with the rules of the fcc or state regulatory agencies  third parties or regulators could challenge our ability to offer our services 
such challenges could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses 
required regulatory approvals may interfere with or delay corporate transactions 
as a regulated company  we are required to obtain the approval of the fcc and certain state regulators before engaging in certain types of transactions  including some mergers  acquisitions of other regulated companies  sales of all or substantial parts of our business  issuances of stock  and incurrence of debt obligations 
the particular types of transactions that require approval differ in each jurisdiction 
if we cannot obtain the required approvals  or if we encounter substantial delays in obtaining them  we may not be able to enter into transactions on favorable terms and our flexibility in operating our business will be limited 
if our flexibility is limited  we may not be able to optimize our operating results 
telecommunications regulations of other countries may restrict our operations 
we will be subject to the regulatory regimes in each of the countries in which we conduct business 
local regulations range from permissive to restrictive  depending upon the country 
changes to existing regulations of foreign countries may decrease the opportunities that are available for us to enter into those markets  or may increase our legal  administrative or operational costs  or may constrain our activities in other ways that we cannot necessarily anticipate 
any of these developments could impair our efforts to develop foreign operations 
we may incur operational and management inefficiencies when we acquire new businesses 
part of our expansion strategy includes acquiring businesses and technologies  such as the sphera acquisition  which we believe will complement our existing business 
these acquisitions will likely involve some or all of the following risks difficulty of assimilating acquired operations and personnel and information systems  potential disruption of our ongoing business  possibility that we may not realize an acceptable return on our investment in these acquired companies or assets  diversion of resources  possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible difficulty of managing our growth  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience  and potential impairment of relationships with employees or clients 
we may need to complete these transactions in order to remain competitive 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain required financing for these transactions or that these transactions will occur 
we must continue our marketing and sales initiatives to increase market awareness and sales of our services 
our services require a sophisticated sales and marketing effort that targets key people within our prospective clients organizations 
this sales effort requires the efforts of select personnel as well as specialized system and consulting engineers within our organization 
our ability to execute our sales and marketing initiatives depends on many factors  including our ability to train  manage and retain employees 
if we are unable to effectively staff our marketing and sales operations  or our marketing efforts are not successful  we may not be able to increase market awareness or sales of our products and services  which may prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
our plans to develop new service offerings may not be successful 
we intend to continue investing significant sales and management resources to developing and selling new service offerings 
there are significant out of pocket expenses associated with this investment  which in turn reduces resources available to develop our traditional lines of business 
the success of these service offerings is uncertain and depends on our ability to successfully coordinate our internal financial  engineering and sales personnel and on many factors outside of our control  including the willingness of our clients to pay for these offerings and the willingness of our vendors to provide the goods and services that these new service offerings require 
if we are unsuccessful in developing and selling our new service offerings  our growth could be adversely affected 
if we do not continue to train  manage and retain employees in our client support organization  clients may significantly reduce purchases of our services 
our client support organization is responsible for providing our clients with technical and operational support  and for identifying and developing opportunities to provide additional services to our existing clients 
competition for qualified client support personnel is intense because few people have the necessary level of technical skills and experience in telecommunications provisioning and network management 
if we fail to train  manage and retain employees in our client support organization  we may be limited in our ability to gain more business from existing clients  and we may be unable to obtain or maintain current information regarding our clients and suppliers communications networks  which could limit our ability to provision future circuits for our clients 
if we do not establish and maintain key client relationships  our revenues may decline 
our success will depend upon our ability to develop and manage key client relationships in order to generate additional revenues from existing clients 
our ability to develop and manage our client relationships depends on  among other things our ability to maintain the timeliness and quality of our services in facilitating the supply of circuits  our ability to deliver our clients additional services  such as network monitoring  maintenance and troubleshooting services  our ability to expand our client support organization with additional  qualified personnel  and performance by the transport suppliers with whom we contract to provide circuits to our clients 
if we fail to establish and maintain these client relationships  our revenues may stagnate or decline 
if we fail to manage expansion effectively  our ability to increase our services and client base could suffer 
our ability to successfully offer our services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations and have substantially increased the number of our employees 
at december   we had five employees while at december   we had full time employees 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures  and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our workforce 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various clients  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively 
risks associated with pending sphera acquisition on february   we announced that we had agreed to acquire the metropolitan  fiber optic ring assets of sphera optical networks as part of sphera s reorganization filing under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
completion of this transaction is subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including but not limited to potential delays in the bankruptcy process and the possibility that a third party could be the successful bidder for the assets of sphera 
in addition  if we complete this acquisition  it will subject us to additional business risks  including the challenge of attracting new clients or increasing sales to existing clients  potential increases in circuit disconnections or client credit problems and difficulties or delays in integrating or operating utx facilities  assets of sphera and optical networking equipment 
if we fail to successfully complete the implementation of our management information systems we may not be able to operate or manage our business effectively 
we are in the process of augmenting our management information systems to facilitate management of client order  client service  billing and financial applications 
our ability to manage our business could be harmed if we fail to successfully and promptly implement all applications of our management information systems  integrate all the client records and the billing  ordering  inventory  management  accounting and other financial information systems of the businesses we have acquired or may acquire into our management information systems  identify all of our information and processing needs  repair bugs and design defects that may exist in our management information systems  implement a wide area network connecting our main offices and our utx facilities in different geographic locations  and maintain and upgrade our management information systems as necessary 
in addition  our ability to efficiently operate our business could suffer if the software which runs our information systems malfunctions 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market  and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we are unable to retain our key personnel and hire additional personnel 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
in addition  we depend on the ability of a relatively new management team to effectively execute our strategies 
we recently hired several of our key employees 
because some members of our management team have worked together only for a short period of time  we need to integrate these officers into our operations 
we will need to hire additional personnel in our communications provisioning  sales  marketing and support areas in the future  and we believe our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain our key employees 
competition for these persons is intense  especially in the communications provisioning area 
in particular  we have experienced difficulty in hiring qualified network engineers  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these individuals 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel could limit our ability to generate revenues 
because we have no patented technology and have limited ability to protect our proprietary information  competitors may more easily enter our market and harm our ability to generate revenues 
we have no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our market 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we have applied for registration of certain of our service marks in the united states and in other countries  and have obtained registrations for certain of our service marks in the united states  the european union  australia  thailand  switzerland  new zealand and singapore 
even if additional registrations are granted  we may be limited in the scope of services for which we may exclusively use our service marks 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and partners  and we control access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or a third party may independently develop similar intellectual property 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
unauthorized use of any of our proprietary information could expose us to competition  which would harm our ability to attract new and existing clients and generate revenues 
certain stockholders will continue to have substantial control over the company and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control 
internet capital group  inc  funds affiliated with comventures and other stockholders  directors and officers  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  acting alone or together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
provisions of our charter documents may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in corporate control 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our stockholders 
there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock that could cause our stock price to fall 
our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock  substantially all of which they are able to sell in the public market 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or market expectations that these sales may occur could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise necessary capital through the issuance of additional common stock 
we expect to experience volatility in the trading of our stock  which could negatively affect its value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of telecommunications and internet related companies  announcements by us or our competitors of new products and services or of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  any loss of a major client  additions or departures of key personnel  any deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  future sales of common stock  and volume fluctuations  which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of internet related companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in a portfolio comprised of commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade debt securities 
as of december   all of our investments had maturities of less than six months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
exchange rate sensitivity we currently operate primarily in the united states  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses to date have been in us dollars 
accordingly  we have had no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
