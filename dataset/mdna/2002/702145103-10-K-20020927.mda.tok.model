item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results generally do not differ materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
inventory is valued using the cost method which values inventory at the lower of the actual cost or market  at the individual item level 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
inventory levels are reviewed to identify slow moving and closeout merchandise that will no longer be carried 
market is determined by the estimated net realizable value  based upon the merchandise selling price 
long lived assets excluding goodwill 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
insurance accruals 
the determination of insurance accruals is done using the services of an actuary  applying certain historical experience factors 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates

 intangible assets

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill  but periodically we evaluate goodwill for recoverability 
we also evaluate goodwill whenever events and changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in fiscal  we recorded million of goodwill amortization which decreased net earnings by  accounting standards not yet adopted in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
beginning in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

were to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in sfas no 
and to address significant implementation issues 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no

the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or 
table of contents disposal activities that are initiated after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation did not have a material impact on our operations for the periods reported 
significant increases in cost of merchandise purchased  labor  employee benefits and other operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
seasonality our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our net sales  cash flow and net income for the year during the fourth calendar quarter of the year  principally due to the sales in october for the halloween season and  to a lesser extent  due to holiday sales for end of year holidays 
our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are theoretically exposed to interest rate change and market risk 
as borrowing patterns are cyclical  we are not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
therefore  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the loan agreement is dependent on the prime rate may  during peak borrowing  have a negative impact on short term results
