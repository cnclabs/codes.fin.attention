critical accounting policies estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred tax assets at august   the company has federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  for which the company has recorded a deferred tax asset 
for the company to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset  the company must achieve future earnings prior to the expiration of its net operating loss carry forwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its net operating loss carry forwards 
the company may need to further adjust that valuation allowance if future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from future estimates 
the valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty associated with the realization of deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation reserve was due primarily to foreign net operating losses 
stock options sfas options granted to employees under the company s stock option plan are accounted for by using the intrinsic method under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which defines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options 
the accounting standards prescribed by sfas are optional and the company has continued to account for stock options under the intrinsic value method specified in apb pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share have been made in accordance with sfas note warranty and defective returns fedders air conditioner products are covered by standard product warranty plans that extend from to years 
in addition  major retailers have consumer return policies which allow consumers the ability to return product that may be defective in lieu of field service 
upon return to the company  these units are inspected  repaired as required  reboxed and held for future sale as factory reconditioned products 
a portion of those units returned are not repairable 
at the time revenue is recognized  upon shipment  measurements of those sales are reduced by estimates of the future costs associated with fulfilling warranty obligations and for the expense associated with repairing or scrapping defective returns 
the company believes the accounting estimate related to warranty costs and defective returns is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can materially affect net income  it requires the company to use historical failure and defective return rates  which may or may not be indicative of future rates 
the estimate for warranty obligations and defective returns is a critical accounting estimate for the hvacr segment 
over the past years  warranty and defective return costs represented approximately of sales for the hvacr segment 
each quarter  the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations is reevaluated  including the assumptions about estimated failure and return rates 
the company s has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a
