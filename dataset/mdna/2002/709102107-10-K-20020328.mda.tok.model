it is a common practice in the real estate industry to invest in real estate in this manner 
of the joint venture properties  the company manages of the properties and other parties  including several of the company s joint venture partners  manage the remaining properties 
none of the company s joint venture partners are affiliates of the company 
the company holds a non controlling interest in the joint ventures  and accounts for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
under this accounting method  the company does not consolidate the joint ventures 
instead  the company records the earnings from the joint ventures under the income statement caption entitled equity in income of partnerships and joint ventures 
changes in the company s investment in these entities are recorded in the balance sheet caption entitled investment in and advances to partnerships and joint ventures  at equity

equity offering on july   the company issued  through a public offering  million shares of beneficial interest at a price of per share the offering 
net proceeds from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount of million and other expenses of approximately million were approximately million 
proceeds from the offering were used to repay million outstanding on an existing construction loan and million of outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund projects then under development 
credit facility the company s operating partnership has entered into a million credit facility the credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility and a million construction facility the construction facility with a group of banks 
the obligations of the company s operating partnership under the credit facility are secured by a pool of ten properties and have been guaranteed by the company 
the credit facility bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus margins ranging from to basis points  depending on the ratio of the company s consolidated liabilities to gross asset value the leverage ratio  each as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit facility 
at december   the margin was set at basis points 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily found in facilities of this type  as well as requirements that the company maintain  on a consolidated basis i a maximum leverage ratio of  ii a maximum borrowing base value as defined in the credit facility of under the revolving facility  iii a minimum weighted average collateral pool property occupancy of  iv minimum tangible net worth of million plus of cumulative net proceeds from the sale of equity securities  v minimum ratios of ebitda to debt service and interest expense as defined in the credit facility of and  respectively  at december   vi maximum floating rate debt of million  and vii maximum commitments for properties under development not in excess of of gross asset value as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
liquidity and capital resources the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its available working capital and net cash provided by operations 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow the company to make any distributions necessary to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company also believes that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the following are some of the risks that could impact company cash flows and require the funding of future distributions  capital expenditures  tenant improvements and or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows o increase in tenant bankruptcies reducing revenue and operating cash flows o increase in interest rates affecting the company s net cost of borrowing o increase in insurance premiums and or the company s portion of claims o eroding market conditions in one or more of our primary geographic regions adversely affecting property operating cash flows the company expects to meet certain long term capital requirements such as property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company also expects to increase the funds available under the revolving facility and the construction facility by placing development properties into the collateral pool upon the achievement of prescribed criteria so as to fund acquisitions  development activities and capital improvements 
in general  when the credit markets are tight  the company may encounter resistance from lenders when the company seeks financing or refinancing for properties or proposed acquisitions 
the company also may be unable to sell additional equity securities on terms that are favorable to the company  if at all 
additionally  the following are some of the potential impediments to accessing additional funds under the credit facility o reduction in occupancy at one or more properties in the collateral pool o reduction in appraised value of one or more properties in the collateral pool o reduction in net operating income at one or more of the properties in the collateral pool o constraining leverage covenants under the credit facility o increased interest rates affecting our interest coverage ratios o reduction in the company s consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda at december  the company had outstanding borrowings of million under its revolving facility and had pledged million under the revolving facility as collateral for several letters of credit 
of the unused portion of the revolving facility of approximately million  as of december   the company s loan covenant restrictions allowed the company to borrow approximately an additional million based on the existing property collateral pool 
as noted  one of the additional means of increasing the company s borrowing capacity via the revolving facility is the addition of unencumbered acquisition and or development properties to the collateral pool 
for example  during the first quarter of  the company placed creekview shopping center  a recently completed retail development project  into the collateral pool  which increased the company s borrowing capacity to approximately million 
the company expects to place additional projects into the collateral pool to provide additional borrowing capacity  as necessary 
the company believes that the anticipated placement of properties into the collateral pool will allow for sufficient availability of borrowing capacity to fund the development pipeline commitments as well as any short term liquidity needs 
mortgage notes in addition to amounts due under the credit facility  a balloon payment of million  of which the company s proportionate share is million  comes due in december with respect to a mortgage loan secured by a property owned by a partnership in which the company has an interest 
construction and mortgage loans on properties wholly owned by the company also mature by their terms 
balloon payments  due in the next three years  on these loans total million for a mortgage loan and million for a construction loan 
the company is pursuing long term financing for the construction loan which has a balloon payment coming due in mortgage notes payable which are secured by of the company s wholly owned properties are due in installments over various terms extending to the year with interest at rates ranging from to with a weighted average interest rate of at december  principal payments are due as follows thousands of dollars year ended principal amortization balloon payments total and thereafter    eight of the company s multifamily communities are financed with million of permanent  fixed rate  long term debt 
this debt carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately 
the eight properties secure the non recourse loans  which amortize over years and mature in may commitments at december   the company had approximately million committed to complete current development and redevelopment projects  which is expected to be financed through the revolving facility or through short term construction loans 
in connection with certain development properties  including those development properties acquired as part of the company s acquisition of tro  the company may be required to issue additional units of limited partner interest in its operating partnership op units upon the achievement of certain financial targets 
cash flows during the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities 
financing activities used cash of million including i million of distributions to shareholders  ii million and million of repayments on a construction loan and the revolving facility  respectively  iii million of mortgage notes payable principal installments  iv million of net distributions to op unit holders and minority partners and v million payment of deferred financing costs offset by i million of net proceeds from shares of beneficial interest issued  including amounts raised through the offering described above and ii million of proceeds from a mortgage loan 
investing activities used cash of million including i million of investments in wholly owned real estate assets  ii million of investments in property under development and iii million of investments in partnerships and joint ventures  offset by i cash proceeds from sales of real estate interests of million  ii cash distributions from partnerships and joint ventures in excess of equity in income of million and iii cash from the consolidation of pri of million 
contingent liabilities the company along with certain of its joint venture partners has guaranteed debt totaling million 
the debt matures in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate protection in order to limit exposure to variable interest rates  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements as follows fixed interest rate notional amount vs 
day libor maturity date million december million december financial instruments sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuation in market interest rates  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio consisted of million in fixed rate mortgage notes  million borrowed under its revolving facility and million of construction notes payable 
changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed debt portfolio assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio  including two interest rate swap agreements  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest incurred at december  a basis point decrease would reduce interest incurred by million at december  acquisitions  dispositions and development activites the company is actively involved in pursuing and evaluating a number of individual property and portfolio acquisition opportunities 
in addition  the company has stated that a key strategic goal is to obtain managerial control of all of its assets 
in certain cases where existing joint venture assets are managed by outside partners  the company is considering the possible acquisition of these outside interests 
in certain cases where that opportunity does not exist  the company is considering the disposition of its interests 
there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any such acquisition or disposition 
acquisitions in  the company entered into an agreement giving it a joint venture interest in willow grove park  a million square foot regional mall in willow grove  pa 
under the agreement  the company is responsible for the expansion of the property to include a new macy s store and decked parking 
the total cost of the expansion through december  was million 
in  the company expects to make an additional cash contribution of approximately million and contribute the expansion asset to the joint venture in return for a subordinated general partnership interest 
also  in  the company purchased the remaining interest in the emerald point multifamily community in virginia beach  va 
dispositions in  the company sold parcels of land located at paxton town centre in harrisburg  pa and commons at magnolia in florence  sc and an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the metroplex shopping center in plymouth meeting  pa 
consistent with management s stated long term strategic plan to review and evaluate all joint venture real estate holdings and non core properties  during and the company sold its interests in several properties 
under this plan  in  the company sold its interest in the ingleside shopping center in thorndale  pa  and in  the company sold the cvs warehouse and distribution center in alexandria  va  valleyview shopping center in wilmington  de  forestville shopping center in forestville  md and the company s interest in park plaza shopping center in pinellas park  fl 
development  expansions and renovations the company is involved in a number of development and redevelopment projects  which may require equity funding by the company or third party debt or equity financing see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in each case  the company will evaluate the financing opportunities available to it at the time a project requires funding 
in cases where the project is undertaken with a joint venture partner  the company s flexibility in funding the project may be governed by the joint venture agreement or the covenants existing in its line of credit  which limit the company s involvement in joint venture projects 
related party transactions the company provides management  leasing and development services for partnerships and other ventures in which certain officers of the company have either direct or indirect ownership interests  including ronald rubin  the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
the company believes that the terms of the management agreements for these services are no less favorable to the company than its agreements with non affiliates 
the company has no off balance sheet transactions other than those discussed in the interest rate protection section 
no officer or employee of the company benefits from or has benefited from any off balance sheet transactions with or involving the company 
the company leases its corporate home office space from an affiliate of certain officers of the company 
the lease terms were established at market rates at the commencement date 
in connection with the company s acquisition of the rubin organization tro in  the company agreed to issue up to  limited partnership units over a five year period ended september  contingent on the company achieving specified performance targets 
through december    contingent limited partnership units had been issued 
an additional  contingent limited partnership units were earned in but have not yet been issued 
the remaining  units may be earned in the recipients of the contingent limited partnership units include officers of the company  including ronald rubin  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  who were partners of tro at the time of tro s acquisition 
significant accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company believes that the most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and asset impairment 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues from tenant rents and other tenant related activities 
tenant rents include base rents  percentage rents  expense reimbursements such as common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities and straight line rents 
the company records base rents on a straight line basis  which means that the monthly base rent income according to the terms of the company s leases with its tenants is adjusted so that an average monthly rent is recorded for each tenant over the term of its lease 
the difference between base rent and straight line rent is a non cash increase or decrease to rental income 
in  non cash straight line rent income was million 
percentage rents represent rental income that the tenant pays based on a percentage of its sales 
tenants that pay percentage rent usually pay in one of two ways  either a percentage of their total sales or a percentage of sales over a certain threshold 
in the latter case  the company does not record percentage rent until the sales threshold has been reached 
expense reimbursement payments are generally made monthly based on a budgeted amount determined at the beginning of the year 
during the year  the company s income increases or decreases based on actual expense levels and changes in other factors that influence the reimbursement amounts  such as occupancy levels 
in  the company accrued million of income because reimbursable expense levels were greater than amounts billed 
these increases decreases are non cash changes to rental income 
shortly after the end of the year  the company prepares a reconciliation of the actual amounts due from tenants 
the difference between the actual amount due and the amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant  depending on whether the tenant paid too much or too little during the year 
the company s other significant source of revenues comes from management activities  including property management  leasing and development 
management fees are generally a percentage of managed property revenues or cash receipts 
leasing fees are earned upon the consummation of new leases 
development fees are earned over the time period of the development activity 
these activities are collectively referred to as management fees in the consolidated statement of income 
there are no significant cash versus accrual differences for these activities 
evaluation of asset impairment the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets for potential impairment indicators 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of the properties 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that a property s value is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss would be measured by comparing the individual property s fair value to its carrying value and reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income

offsetting this increase is a million decrease in lease termination fees from million in to million in lease termination fees in included an unusually large million fee received in connection with the sale of the cvs warehouse and distribution center 
base rents increased due to a million increase in retail rents  resulting from two properties under development in now placed in service  and higher rents due to new and renewal leases at higher rates in these positive influences were partially offset by the sale of two retail properties that were sold in the third quarter of  resulting in a million reduction in base rents
