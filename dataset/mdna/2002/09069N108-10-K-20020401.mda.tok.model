from time to time  the company may be a party to legal proceedings or involved in related investigations  inquiries or discussions  in each case  arising in the ordinary course of the company s business 
although no assurance can be given  management does not presently believe that any current matters would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  financial position or results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will begin expiring in in the opinion of management  as the company has not had a history of consistent profitability  it is uncertain whether the company will realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets and has provided a valuation allowance 
as of december   certain of the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitation and may be utilized in a future year upon release of the limitation 
if federal net operating loss carryforwards are not utilized in the year they are available they may be utilized in a future year to the extent they have not expired 
other matters in  the company recorded a million special charge against earnings in as a result of an agreement in principle with respect to a civil settlement of a federal and state of tennessee investigation in connection with conduct involving  among others  two former officers of the company occurring prior to the company s august initial public offering

the tenncare r program operates under a demonstration waiver from the united states center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
that waiver is the basis of the company s ongoing service to those mcos in the tenncare r program 
the waiver expired on december  and was renewed without material modification through december  in addition  the state of tennessee and the federal governments have agreed to negotiate towards an additional two year extension of the waiver through december  while the company believes that pharmacy benefits will continue to be provided to medicaid and other eligible tenncare r enrollees through mcos in one form or another through at least december   there can be no assurances that such waiver will be renewed after december   that pharmacy benefits will continue under the tenncare r program or that the mco s currently being serviced by the company will continue their respective relationships with it under the existing or a successor program or on the same or similar terms and conditions 
if the waiver is not renewed and the company is not providing pbm and or distributing specialty products to those lives under a successor program or arrangement  then the failure to provide such services could have a material and adverse affect on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
moreover  should the funding sources and or conditions for the tenncare r program change significantly  the tenncare r program s ability to pay the mcos  and in turn the mcos ability to pay the company  could materially and adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
historically  as a result of providing capitated pbm services to certain tenncare r mcos  the company s pharmaceutical claims costs had been subject to significant increases from october through february  which the company believes is due to the need for increased medical attention to  and intervention with  mcos members during the colder months 
the resulting increase in pharmaceutical costs impacted the profitability of capitated contracts 
currently  the company has no capitated pbm arrangements with mcos participating in the tenncare r program 
fee for service arrangements mitigate the adverse effect on profitability of higher pharmaceutical costs incurred under capitated contracts  as higher utilization positively impacts profitability 
the company presently anticipates that less than of its revenues for will be derived from capitated arrangements 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability of the company to restrict its mco clients formularies to the extent anticipated by the company at the time contracted pbm services are implemented  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
there are currently no loss contracts and management does not believe that there is an overall trend towards losses on its existing capitated contracts 
in the first quarter of  the company commenced a stock repurchase program under which it was authorized to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in private transactions 
in february  the company repurchased  shares of common stock at a price of per share in private transactions 
see certain relationships and related transactions below 
since that date  the company has not repurchased any additional shares of its common stock 
on march   mr 
richard friedman  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  repaid in full a million loan from the company  together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
this loan  together with accrued and upaid interest  totaled approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt 
at december  the company did not have any long term debt 
the company does not invest in or otherwise use derivative financial instruments 
at december   the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others  and debt approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
because management does not believe that its exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  the company has not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk through the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that risk as appropriate
