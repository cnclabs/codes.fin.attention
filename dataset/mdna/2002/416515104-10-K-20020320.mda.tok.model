although average individual annuity account values in were higher than  account values at december  declined billion  or  as compared to december   as strong sales were not sufficient to offset surrenders and the impact of the retreating equity markets 
in addition  fee income from other investment products increased  or  primarily driven by the company s retail mutual fund operation  where related assets under management increased billion  or 
this substantial increase in the retail mutual fund operation was due to sales of billion in  which was partially offset by redemptions

outlook the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement 
demographic trends suggest that as the baby boom generation matures  a significant portion of the united states population will allocate a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the social security system and increases in average life expectancy 
as this market grows  particularly for variable annuities and mutual funds  new companies are continually entering the market  aggressively seeking distribution channels and pursuing market share 
this trend is not expected to subside  particularly in light of the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act  which permits affiliations among banks  insurance companies and securities firms 
management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial services industry 
for example  the hartford is introducing a tax advantaged college savings product plan in early called smart smart is a state sponsored education savings program established by the state of west virginia which offers an easy way for both the residents of west virginia and out of state participants to invest for a college education 
smart will allow investors to choose from a wide variety of investment portfolios to match their risk preference to help accumulate savings for college 
the smart product complements hartford life s existing offering of investment products mutual funds  variable annuities  k  and b plans 
it also leverages the company s capabilities in distribution  service and fund performance 
the hartford believes this is a significant market opportunity and the benefits of investing in plans will be well received by many americans saving for college

operating income increased  or  primarily driven by the increased revenues described above 
outlook as employers continue to offer benefit plans in order to attract and retain valued employees  management expects that the need for group life and group disability insurance will continue to expand and believes the company is well positioned to take advantage of this growth potential 
the group benefits segment offered medicare supplement insurance to members of several retired military officer associations 
federal legislation effective in the fourth quarter of  now provides retired military officers age and older with full medical insurance paid for by the government  eliminating the need for medicare supplement insurance

the main focus of these operations is the proper disposition of claims  resolving disputes and collecting reinsurance proceeds related largely to business underwritten and reinsured prior to also included in other operations are the company s international property and casualty businesses 
during the fourth quarter  the company finalized a new management structure within its other operations segment that consolidates the management and claims handling responsibility of the company s environmental and asbestos exposures 
in addition  the company consolidated its environmental and asbestos reserves into one legal entity within other operations 
the transaction was accomplished through the use of an intercompany reinsurance agreement  and resulted in of reserves  primarily related to environmental and asbestos exposures from and prior  being ceded from the specialty commercial segment to other operations

outlook except for the uncertainties related to dispute resolution  reinsurance collection and those discussed in the environmental and asbestos claims section  management does not anticipate the future financial performance of other operations to have a material effect on the future operating results of the company 
deferred acquisition costs management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
one of the significant estimates made includes those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
life policy acquisition costs  which include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business  are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts  usually years 
deferred policy acquisition costs related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method 
under the retrospective deposit method  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits from investment  mortality and expense margins and surrender charges 
actual gross profits can vary from management s estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization 
management periodically reviews these estimates and evaluates the recoverability of the deferred acquisition cost asset 
when appropriate  management revises its assumptions on the estimated gross profits of these contracts and the cumulative amortization for the books of business are re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income 
the average rate of assumed future investment yield used in estimating expected gross profits related to variable annuity and variable life business was at december  and for all other products including fixed annuities and other universal life type contracts the average assumed investment yield ranged from deferred policy acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income 
adjustments are made each year to recognize actual experience as compared to assumed experience for the current period 
to date  our experience has generally been consistent or favorable to the assumptions used in determining dac amortization 
however  if we were to experience a material adverse deviation in certain critical assumptions  including surrender rates  mortality experience  or investment performance  there could be a negative effect on the company s reported earnings and stockholders equity 
property casualty the property casualty operations also incur costs related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies 
these costs include agent and broker commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses 
these costs are deferred and amortized over policy terms 
estimates of the present value of future revenues  including net investment income and tax benefits  are compared to estimates of the present value of future costs  including amortization of policy acquisition costs  to determine if the deferred acquisition costs are recoverable  and if not  they are charged to expense 
reserves life in accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which life operates  life insurance subsidiaries of the hartford establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are calculated to meet the hartford s future obligations 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states  which are modified to reflect the hartford s actual experience when appropriate 
these reserves are computed at amounts that  with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet the hartford s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
reserves also include unearned premiums  premium deposits  claims incurred but not reported ibnr and claims reported but not yet paid 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves 
the liability for policy benefits for universal life type contracts and interest sensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders  including credited interest  amounts that have been assessed to compensate the company for services to be performed over future periods  and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract 
certain contracts include provisions whereby a guaranteed death benefit is provided in the event that the contractholder s account value at death is below the guaranteed value 
although the company reinsures the majority of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business  declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
the company records the death benefit costs  net of reinsurance  as they are incurred 
for investment contracts  policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values  which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period 
for the company s group disability policies  the level of reserves is based on a variety of factors including particular diagnoses  termination rates and benefit levels 
the persistency of the hartford s annuity and other interest sensitive life insurance reserves is enhanced by policy restrictions on the withdrawal of funds 
withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty free amounts are assessed a surrender charge during a penalty period  which is usually at least seven years 
such surrender charge is initially a percentage of either the accumulation value or considerations received  which varies by product  and generally decreases gradually during the penalty period 
surrender charges are set at levels to protect the hartford from loss on early terminations and to reduce the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during periods of increasing interest rates  thereby lengthening the effective duration of policy liabilities and improving the company s ability to maintain profitability on such policies 
property casualty the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made by policyholders or against policyholders 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events  and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the uncertainties involved with the reserving process have become increasingly unpredictable due to a number of complex factors including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
as a result of september  the company established estimated gross reserves of billion and estimated net reserves of related to property and casualty operations 
this loss estimate includes coverages related to property  business interruption  workers compensation and other liability exposures  including those underwritten by the company s assumed reinsurance operation 
the company based the loss estimate upon a review of insured exposures using a variety of assumptions and actuarial techniques  including estimated amounts for unknown and unreported policyholder losses and costs incurred in settling claims 
included in net reserves was an estimate of amounts recoverable under the company s ceded reinsurance programs 
as a result of the uncertainties involved in the estimation process  final claims settlement may vary from present estimates 
the hartford continually reviews the adequacy of its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves on an overall basis 
as additional experience and other relevant data become available  reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
adjustments to previously established reserves  if any  will be reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is made 
for the year ended december   there were no changes to these reserving assumptions that had a significant impact on the reserves or results of operations 
in the judgment of management  all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
for a discussion of environmental and asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to these reserves  refer to the next section 
environmental and asbestos claims the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from environmental exposures and for injuries from asbestos and asbestos related products  both of which affect the property casualty operation 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
with regard to these claims  uncertainty exists which impacts the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
the hartford finds that conventional reserving techniques cannot estimate the ultimate cost of these claims because of inadequate development patterns and inconsistent emerging legal doctrine 
the majority of environmental claims and many types of asbestos claims differ from any other type of contractual claims because there is almost no agreement or consistent precedent to determine what  if any  coverage exists or which  if any  policy years and insurers or reinsurers may be liable 
further uncertainty arises with environmental claims since claims are often made under policies  the existence of which may be in dispute  the terms of which may have changed over many years  which may or may not provide for legal defense costs  and which may or may not contain environmental exclusion clauses that may be absolute or allow for fortuitous events 
courts in different jurisdictions have reached disparate conclusions on similar issues and in certain situations have broadened the interpretation of policy coverage and liability issues 
in light of the extensive claim settlement process for environmental and asbestos claims  which involves comprehensive fact gathering  subject matter expertise and intensive litigation  the hartford established an environmental claims facility in to defend itself aggressively against unwarranted claims and to minimize costs 
within the property and casualty insurance industry in the mid s  progress was made in developing sophisticated  alternative methodologies utilizing company experience and supplemental databases to assess environmental and asbestos liabilities 
consistent with the hartford s practice of using the best techniques to estimate the company s environmental and asbestos exposures  a study was initiated in april based on known cases 
the hartford  utilizing internal staff supplemented by outside legal and actuarial consultants  completed the study in october the study included a review of identified environmental and asbestos exposures of north american property casualty  along with the united states exposures of the hartford s other operations segment 
the methodology utilized a ground up analysis of policy  site and exposure level data for a representative sample of the hartford s claims 
the results of the evaluation were extrapolated against the balance of the claim population to estimate the company s overall exposure for reported claims 
in addition to estimating liabilities on reported environmental and asbestos claims  the hartford estimated reserves for claims incurred but not reported 
the ibnr reserve was estimated using information on reporting patterns of known insureds  characteristics of insureds such as limits exposed  attachment points and number of coverage years involved  third party costs and closed claims 
included in the hartford s analysis of environmental and asbestos exposures was a review of applicable reinsurance coverage 
reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the reinsurance coverage that applied to the balance of the reported environmental and asbestos claims and to the ibnr estimates 
an international actuarial firm reviewed the hartford s approach and concluded that the way the company studied its exposures  the thoroughness of its analysis and the way the hartford came to its estimates were reasonable and comprehensive 
the company believes that its methodology continues to be reasonable and comprehensive

the ending liabilities are net of reinsurance on reported and unreported claims of   and  for  and  respectively 
as of december   and  reserves for environmental and asbestos  gross of reinsurance  were and   and  and  and  respectively 
actual claim settlements since have indicated that a smaller proportion of the total environmental and asbestos reserves should have originally been allocated to environmental  with a greater portion allocated to asbestos 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the company reclassified of environmental reserves to asbestos 
with the consolidation of the hartford s environmental and asbestos liabilities into the other operations segment  as previously discussed in the other operations section  essentially all of the company s environmental and asbestos reserves are held within other operations 
the hartford believes that the environmental and asbestos reserves  reported at december   are a reasonable estimate of the ultimate remaining liability for these claims based upon known facts  current assumptions and the hartford s methodologies 
future social  economic  legal or legislative developments may alter the original intent of policies and the scope of coverage 
the hartford will continue to evaluate new methodologies and developments  such as the increasing level of asbestos claims being tendered under the comprehensive general liability operations non product section of policies  as they arise in order to supplement the company s ongoing analysis and review of its environmental and asbestos exposures 
these future reviews may result in a change in reserves  impacting the hartford s results of operations in the period in which the reserve estimates are changed 
while the impact of these changes could have a material effect on future results of operations  the hartford does not expect such changes would have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
investments return on invested assets is an important element of the hartford s financial results 
significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately and of the company s consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the company s return on  and the fair value of  fixed maturity investments  which comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
other events beyond the company s control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments 
specifically  a downgrade of an issuer s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the company s investment return 
the company also invests in unaffiliated limited partnership arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio 
these limited partnerships represent approximately of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and limited partnerships are typically less liquid than direct investments in fixed income or equity investments 
market volatility and other factors beyond the company s control can adversely affect the value of these investments 
because the company is a limited partner  its ability to control the timing or the realization of the related investment income is restricted 
a significant decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other than temporary could result in the company s recognition of a loss in its financial results prior to the actual sale of the investment 
the hartford s investment portfolios are divided between life and property casualty 
the investment portfolios are managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of each operation s respective liabilities and within established risk parameters 
for a further discussion on the hartford s approach to managing risks  see the capital markets risk management section 
the investment portfolios of life and property casualty are managed by hartford investment management company himco  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford 
himco is responsible for monitoring and managing the asset liability profile  establishing investment objectives and guidelines  and determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  convexity and other characteristics of the portfolios 
security selection and monitoring are performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams

also included in net realized capital losses is a loss recognized on the sale of the company s interest in an argentine insurance joint venture  in addition to losses associated with the credit deterioration of certain investments in which the company has an indirect economic interest 
these losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities 
compared to net investment income  excluding policy loan income  increased  or 
the increase was primarily due to higher yields earned on the investment of cash flow from operations and reinvestment of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in a higher interest rate environment 
policy loan income decreased  or  due to the decrease in leveraged coli business 
net realized capital losses increased primarily as a result of portfolio rebalancing in a higher interest rate environment 
property casualty the investment objective for the majority of property casualty is to maximize economic value while generating after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
for property casualty s other operations segment  the investment objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities

an additional of losses were sustained on sales of enron corporation common stock 
also included in net realized capital losses were losses generated from the sales of international subsidiaries of  in addition to losses associated with the credit deterioration of certain investments in which the company has an indirect economic interest 
these losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities 
compared to both before and after tax net investment income and yields were relatively flat compared to the prior year 
net realized capital gains increased by for primarily as a result of the before tax gain recognized on the sale of zwolsche  partially offset by net realized capital losses in the investment portfolio

separate account products separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder 
the company s separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
the primary investment objective of guaranteed separate accounts is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section under market risk life interest rate risk 
investment objectives for non guaranteed separate accounts vary by fund account type  as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations 
non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable life insurance contracts and variable coli 
capital markets risk management the hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset liability management activities 
investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments  while asset liability management is the responsibility of separate and distinct risk management units supporting life and property casualty operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
the company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and asset liability management risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the ability of an obligor or counterparty to make timely payments of principal and or interest  and market risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  securities prices  market indices  yield curves or currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes 
credit risk the hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the company s finance committee 
the company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower  issuer and counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular interval 
the company s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to and held by  or on behalf of  the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds 
the hartford is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than of the company s stockholders equity 
the following tables identify fixed maturity securities for life  including guaranteed separate accounts  and property casualty by credit quality 
the ratings referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of a nationally recognized rating organization or  if not rated  assigned based on the company s internal analysis of such securities

life is responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity to that of corporate and policyholder obligations 
life s fixed maturity portfolios have material market exposure to interest rate risk 
property casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
property casualty has material exposure to interest rate and equity market risk 
the company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits 
downward movement in market interest rates during resulted in a significant increase in the unrealized appreciation of the fixed maturity security portfolio from however  the hartford s asset allocation and its exposure to market risk as of december  have not changed materially from its position at december  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded futures and options  in compliance with company policy and regulatory requirements in order to achieve one of three company approved objectives to hedge risk arising from interest rate  price or currency exchange rate volatility  to manage liquidity  or to control transaction costs 
the company does not make a market or trade derivatives for the express purpose of earning trading profits 
interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies  agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date  at an agreed exchange rate 
there is also periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts 
interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates  the amount  if any  by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike rate  applied to a notional principal amount 
a premium payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception  and no principal payments are exchanged 
forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
futures contracts trade on organized exchanges 
margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities  and changes in the futures contract values are settled daily in cash 
option contracts grant the purchaser  for a premium payment  the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price  within a specified period or on a stated date 
the company uses derivative instruments in its management of market risk consistent with four risk management strategies hedging anticipated transactions  hedging liability instruments  hedging invested assets and hedging portfolios of assets and or liabilities 
for additional information on these strategies along with tables reflecting outstanding derivative instruments  see the life and property casualty discussions below 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the finance committee of the board of directors 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments for both general and guaranteed separate accounts at december  and totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within life and property casualty 
life interest rate risk life s general account and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact life s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
life s general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade  fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  tax exempt municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these and life s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines  exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
for further discussion of the company s risk management techniques to manage this market risk  see the asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk discussed below 
as described above  life holds a significant fixed maturity portfolio that includes both fixed and variable rate securities 
the following table reflects the principal amounts of life s general and guaranteed separate accounts fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at december  comparative totals are included as of december  expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon wac on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of december  and  and is primarily based on london interbank offered rate libor 
callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or maturity  depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates

asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk life employs several risk management tools to quantify and manage market risk arising from their investments and interest sensitive liabilities 
for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations  hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks 
as an end user of derivatives  life uses a variety of derivatives  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options  in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities 
at december   notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion at december  billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
the economic objectives and strategies for which the company utilizes derivatives are categorized as follows anticipatory hedging for certain liabilities  the company commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit 
anticipatory hedges are executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset 
these hedges involve taking a long position purchase in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments 
the notional amounts of anticipatory hedges as of december  and were and  respectively 
liability hedging several products obligate the company to credit a return to the contract holder which is indexed to a market rate 
to hedge risks associated with these products  the company enters into various derivative contracts 
interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
this hedging strategy enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability matching policy 
in addition  interest rate swaps are used to convert certain variable contract rates to different variable rates  thereby allowing them to be appropriately matched against variable rate assets 
finally  interest rate caps and option contracts are used to hedge against the risk of contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment 
the notional amounts of derivatives used for liability hedging as of december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
asset hedging to meet the various policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective  prudent investment risk diversification  the company may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability 
the use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others 
the selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk  the liquidity and efficiency of the market  and the asset and liability characteristics 
the notional amounts of asset hedges as of december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
portfolio hedging the company periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to its corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels 
portfolio hedges reduce the duration and convexity mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates 
the notional amounts of portfolio hedges as of december  and were and billion  respectively 
the following tables provide information as of december  with comparative totals for december  on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies

life product liability characteristics life s product liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  include accumulation vehicles such as fixed and variable annuities  other investment and universal life type contracts  and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
asset accumulation vehicles while interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
fixed rate products in this category require the payment of a fixed rate for a certain period of time 
the cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
contract duration is dependent on the policyholder s choice of guarantee period 
indexed products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the life operations to pay a rate that is determined by an external index 
the amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index 
the primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles  with the additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability 
product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years 
interest credited products in this category credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of life s variable annuity products 
liability duration is short to intermediate term 
other insurance products long term pay out liabilities products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and long term disability contracts 
contract duration is generally five to ten years 
short term pay out liabilities these liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year 
the primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows 
liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities 
products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts 
management of the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of life s management strategy 
the estimated cash flows of insurance policy liabilities based upon internal actuarial assumptions as of december  are reflected in the table below by expected maturity year

as of december  and  the fair values of life s investment contracts  including guaranteed separate accounts  were billion and billion  respectively 
sensitivity to changes in interest rates for liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by life  the sensitivity of the net economic value discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows of those portfolios to basis point shifts in interest rates are shown in the following table 
change in net economic value basis point shift amount percent of liability value these fixed liabilities represented about and of life s general and guaranteed separate account liabilities at december  and  respectively 
the remaining liabilities generally allow life significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
the fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives and are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques  and are evaluated on an annual basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
property casualty interest rate risk the primary exposure to interest rate risk in property casualty relates to its fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  interest rate risk exists on debt and trust preferred securities issued 
derivative instruments are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total notional amount as of december  and of billion and  respectively 
the principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at december   are reflected in the following table 
comparative totals are included as of december  expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the wac on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of december  and  and is based primarily on libor 
callable bonds and notes are primarily municipal bonds  and are distributed to either call dates or maturity depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds contained in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates

there can be no assurance that the company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
as a result of september and subsequent reviews by major independent rating agencies  all insurance financial strength and debt ratings of the hartford were reaffirmed 
however  negative outlooks were placed upon the debt ratings of the company by moody s and the property and casualty financial strength rating by standard poor s 
all other ratings were reaffirmed with stable outlooks 
liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of the hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  debt securities and borrowings from its credit facility 
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford financial services group  inc is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries  enabling it to service debt  pay dividends on its common stock and pay certain business expenses 
dividends to the hartford financial services group  inc from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
under these laws  the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments out of restricted surplus 
these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
as of december   the maximum amount of statutory dividends which may be paid to the hartford financial services group  inc from its insurance subsidiaries in  without prior regulatory approval  is the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions  and to purchase new investments 
in addition  the hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs

future terrorism exposures the september terrorist attack had a significant impact on the hartford and the insurance industry as a whole 
since that time  the hartford has taken steps to limit future exposure to terrorist acts 
these steps include attaching terrorist exclusions to our policies wherever possible and identifying and managing concentrated exposures by location and dividing the exposures into terrorism risk classes 
the hartford and the industry continue to support the development of federal legislation to provide a federal insurance program  which would help share in potential losses from terrorism 
however  in the absence of a federally backed capital resource or availability of adequate reinsurance coverage and despite the steps already taken to limit exposure  the hartford may not have the capacity to cover future large scale terrorist acts such as nuclear  chemical or biological attacks 
in addition  losses related to future terrorist attacks could negatively impact the company s financial strength and debt ratings 
as a result  any losses related to future terrorist attacks could have a material impact to the liquidity  financial condition and results of operation of the hartford 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used for investing activities    net cash provided by used for financing activities   cash end of year compared to the increase in cash from financing activities was the result of current year proceeds on investment type contracts versus the prior year disbursements for investment type contracts and financing activities related to fortis and september cash provided by financing and operating activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities 
cash flows from operating activities were comparable with prior year 
compared to the increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of growth in life business  along with favorable underwriting cash flows in property casualty 
the decrease in cash used for financing activities was attributable to net financing for the hli repurchase as well as a lower level of disbursements for investment type contracts related to the leveraged block of coli business 
the financing activities  along with the increase in cash provided by operating activities  accounted for the change in cash from investing activities 
operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies 
the requirements consist of formulas  which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
rbc is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting  asset  credit and off balance sheet risks 
as of december   each of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries within life and property casualty had more than sufficient capital to meet the naic s rbc requirements 
regulatory matters and contingencies legislative initiatives the business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels 
passage in november of the financial services modernization act  which permits affiliations among banks  insurance companies and securities firms  may have competitive  operational and other implications for the company 
among other provisions  the measure includes privacy protections requiring all financial service providers to disclose their privacy policies and restrict the sharing of personal information for marketing purposes 
various states are considering even more restrictive privacy measures that could potentially affect the company s operations 
enactment of the financial services modernization act at the federal level has also focused renewed attention on state regulation of insurance 
elements of the insurance industry are involved in a countrywide initiative to streamline regulatory procedures  either through the modification of rate and form filing requirements or congressional adoption of optional federal charter legislation 
federal measures which have been previously considered or enacted by congress and which  if revisited  could affect the insurance business  include tax law changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products  as well as changes in individual income tax rates and the estate tax  a number of which changes could have an impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles 
legislation to restructure the social security system  expand private pension plans  and create new retirement savings incentives also may be considered 
it is too early to determine the future disposition of any of these proposals 
therefore  the potential impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
congress is expected to continue considering terrorism insurance backstop legislation and proposals to moderate the business community s asbestos exposure 
both have the potential to reduce claim exposures  however  enactment of such legislation may not occur in the current congress 
proposed legislation to reduce abusive class action lawsuits would also have a beneficial impact  but prospects for near term enactment are likewise uncertain 
so called patient protection legislation introduced in congress and passed in many states includes provisions permitting lawsuits against health maintenance organizations hmos for denial of coverage 
although the company is not a health insurer or health care provider  passage of such legislation could affect medical claim costs to the extent that hmos were constrained from actively managing care 
insolvency fund in all states  insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund 
in most states  in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state  members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer 
a particular state s fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged 
assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state 
such assessments paid by the hartford approximated in  in and in naic codification the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles codification in march the effective date for the statutory accounting guidance was january  each of the hartford s domiciliary states has adopted codification  and the company has made the necessary changes in its statutory reporting required for implementation 
as of december   the impact of applying the new guidance resulted in a benefit of approximately in statutory surplus 
dependence on certain third party relationships the company distributes its annuity  life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels  including broker dealers  banks  wholesalers  its own internal sales force and other third party organizations 
the company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the company or such third parties 
an interruption in the company s continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the company s ability to market its products 
during the first quarter of  the company modified its existing  exclusive contract with one such third party  putnam mutual funds corp 
putnam to eliminate the exclusivity provision which allowed both parties to pursue new market opportunities 
putnam is contractually obligated to support and service the related annuity in force block of business and to market  support and service new business 
however  there can be no assurance that this contract modification will not adversely impact the company s ability to distribute putnam related products
