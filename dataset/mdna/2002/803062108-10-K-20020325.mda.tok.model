item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our financial results for declined substantially from our financial results for  due primarily to the decrease in the demand for our services  and the demand  in general  for advanced technology consulting services 
this decrease reflected the declining economic climate in the united states in late and in as a result of this decrease in demand  our revenues for the year ended december  decreased from our revenues for the year ended december   and our net income declined from million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  our quarterly revenues declined sequentially throughout the year  with our revenues for the three month periods ended march  june  september and december  decreasing   and  respectively  from each of the previous quarters 
we expect to experience a further decline in our revenues  and flat or declining operating results  for the quarter ended march   which could continue into future quarters 
as a result of the losses incurred for the year ended december  and the expected further decline in our revenues in the first quarter of  we reduced our work force in march  july and february we also reduced office space in cities throughout the united states and closed our sydney  australia office 
although our operating cash flow for the year ended december  resulted in a use of cash of million  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  and we anticipate our balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to be in excess of million at the end of the first quarter of we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and restructuring requirements for at least the next months 
we cannot predict when the market for advanced technology consulting services will improve 
when the market does improve  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the demand for our services will increase 
we believe that the current lack of demand for advanced technology consulting services will continue during the first part of  and that our operations and financial results will continue to be negatively affected during that period 
any continued decline in our revenues will have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  despite cost savings realized from our march and july restructuring plans  and anticipated cost savings from our additional restructuring actions announced in february  our costs for project personnel  sales and marketing and general and administrative could continue to increase as a percentage of revenues  thereby affecting our operating results 
also  despite the march and july restructuring plans  we announced a further reduction in our workforce in february due to an expected further decline in our revenues and flat or declining operating results for the quarter ended march  as a result of this reduction  we had  full time employees as of march   composed of  project personnel  general and administrative personnel and 
table of contents sales and marketing personnel 
we expect to take a restructuring charge in the first quarter of of approximately to million  which will consist of severance and related expenses from the reduction in workforce  and other charges related to office space consolidations 
we expect cost savings from the restructuring plan announced in february of approximately million in the first quarter of  and approximately million per quarter thereafter upon full implementation of the announced plan 
our future revenues and operating results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large project or client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in a particular quarter 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize all of our revenue from the provision of professional services under written service contracts with our clients 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed price  fixed timeframe contracts 
all revenue generated from fixed price contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on labor hours incurred to total labor hours 
this method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed timeframe contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our project delivery and industry business unit finance personnel continually review labor hours incurred and total labor hours  resulting in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for a contract 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
all revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
in some instances during and  we provided services to clients in exchange for equity instruments of 
table of contents the client 
we measure the fair value of the equity instrument on the date the parties come to a mutual understanding of the terms of the arrangement and a commitment for performance by us to earn the equity instruments is reached  or when the equity is earned  whichever occurs earlier 
for the years ended december  and   and million  respectively  of equity was received for services rendered 
earnings recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue for services only in those situations where collection from the client is probable 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
our project delivery and industry business unit finance personnel continuously monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also incur out of pocket expenses which are reimbursable by the client 
through december   these expenses were accounted for as a reduction of the related costs 
effective january   reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred will be characterized as revenue in our statement of operations 
see page for new accounting pronouncement 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  anticipated additional operating losses for the first quarter of and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately million during the year ended december  the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
had we not recorded this allowance  we would have reported materially different results 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be 
table of contents disposed of  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include o significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
to date  no such impairment has been indicated 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
it is possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in march and july and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
we specifically identified all employees that were to be terminated and notified them on the date that the action was announced to the public 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  in addition to future depreciation of the related leasehold improvements  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sub lease arrangement 
we changed our original estimates in due to changing real estate markets  which resulted in net additional restructuring charges 
if the rental markets continue to change  our sub lease assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements  other than our owned joint venture in milan  italy 
see equity investments in this part ii  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this joint venture 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
effect of certain transactions restructurings as a result of the decline in the demand for advanced technology consulting services that began in the second half of  we announced restructuring plans to reduce our workforce and operations in march and july in connection with the restructuring plan announced in march  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  which consisted of severance and related expenses from a 
table of contents reduction in our workforce  the consolidation of our office space in certain cities where we had multiple office locations and other charges related to closing our sydney  australia office 
the march restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately employees  of the terminated employees were project personnel  were selling and marketing personnel and were general and administrative personnel 
due to declining rental markets  we do not expect to sub lease certain office space as quickly or at rates as high as originally anticipated  resulting in additional restructuring charges of million for facilities during the second through fourth quarters of  for a total charge of million for this restructuring plan 
if the rental markets continue to change  our sub lease assumptions may not be accurate resulting in additional adjustments to the restructuring accrual 
in connection with the further restructuring of our operations announced in july  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the quarter ended september   which consisted of severance and related expenses from a reduction in our workforce  and other costs related to office space consolidations

the dilution was due to the sale by di of shares to new investors  which occurred at a higher share price than we previously paid 
we recorded a million gain as a result of the change in equity interest 
other expense we classify all cost method equity investments of publicly traded companies as available for sale 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value as of each balance sheet date 
fair value is determined based on market quotations 
investments in equity securities for which fair value is not readily determinable are carried at cost 
if any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment below cost  we consider available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the writedown is included in our consolidated statement of operations 
in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  to write down certain investments we made in certain businesses because we considered the decline in the value of these investments to be other than temporary 
interest income interest income for and was derived primarily from investment of the proceeds from our public stock offerings and cash provided by operations  which were invested primarily in tax exempt  short term municipal bonds  commercial paper and us government securities 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in the average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
benefit provision for income taxes we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
for the three months ended march  and june   we recorded an income tax benefit 
at that time  it was determined that the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets for federal and state income tax purposes was considered more likely than not  due to taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipated sufficient future taxable income 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  anticipated additional operating losses for the first quarter of and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately million on our deferred tax assets during the third and fourth quarter of if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
we recorded a net income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   which relates primarily to a tax benefit for net operating loss carrybacks  reversals of temporary differences between book and tax accounting and foreign tax liabilities 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into 
table of contents areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
due to the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of on march   we will be able to carryback our tax net operating loss for us federal purposes to all previous tax years to including the million income tax receivable included in our consolidated balance sheet at december   we estimate that we will recover in approximately million of taxes paid in prior years 
net equity loss from investees we use the equity method of accounting for investments when we have an ownership interest of to or the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee s operating activities 
net equity loss from investees for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
this consisted of net losses from sapient spa of approximately  and from di of approximately  for the year ended december  and net losses from sapient spa of approximately  offset by equity in net income from di of approximately  for the year ended december  minority interest minority interest income for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  related to di s interest in our japanese subsidiary s losses 
di acquired this interest in october years ended december  and revenues revenues for increased over revenues for the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in the number and average size of client projects and billing rate increases 
in  our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  no client accounted for more than of such revenues and two clients each accounted for more than of such revenues 
in  our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  no clients accounted for more than of such revenues and one client accounted for more than of such revenues 
project personnel costs project personnel costs increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  due to lower billable utilization of project personnel 
project personnel costs increased as a percentage of revenues from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of this was due primarily to a decline in revenue growth in the fourth quarter of resulting in lower employee utilization 
the increase in project personnel costs for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the number of project personnel from  at december  to  at december  and to higher compensation for project personnel 
selling and marketing costs selling and marketing costs decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the higher percentage in was primarily due to investments that we made in a new brand identity during and also due to an advertising campaign launched in the third quarter of selling and marketing personnel grew from employees at december  to employees at december  general and administrative costs general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  due primarily to increases in general and administrative personnel and occupancy expenses 
general and administrative costs increased as a percentage of revenues from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of  and was due primarily to developing support for expected revenue growth which did not materialize 
the increase in general and administrative costs for compared to was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees hired during  an increase in occupancy expenses related to 
table of contents significant expansion of our office space and increased depreciation costs related to our increased investments in property and equipment 
general and administrative personnel grew from employees at december  to employees at december  our total headcount increased from  at december  to  at december  total occupancy at december  was approximately million square feet  compared to approximately  square feet at december  amortization of intangible assets the increase in amortization of intangible assets costs for compared to was primarily related to the human code  hwt and tlg acquisitions 
amortization periods range from three to seven years 
amortization of intangible assets increased as a percentage of revenues from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of  and was primarily due to the human code acquisition  which occurred on august  stock based compensation stock based compensation consists of expenses for deferred compensation associated with the human code  tlg and adjacency acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisition of human code  we assumed the outstanding options granted under the human code stock option stock issuance plan 
the options vest ratably over periods up to four years 
we recorded deferred compensation of million related to the intrinsic value of the unvested options  of which million has not been amortized as of december  in connection with the tlg acquisition  at december   we were committed to issue million of restricted sapient common stock 
we began to amortize the million of restricted stock over the vesting period of years commencing on the date of acquisition 
prior to our acquisition of adjacency in march  adjacency granted stock options at below fair market value 
the options were granted in november of with a three year vesting schedule commencing on the date of employment 
a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of was the result of change in control provisions 
acquisition costs we incurred a charge of approximately million in for costs associated with the adjacency acquisition  which consisted primarily of investment banking  accounting and legal fees 
other expense in  we recorded million in charges to write down certain investments we made in certain businesses  because we considered the decline in the value of these investments to be other than temporary 
interest income interest income for and was derived primarily from investment of the proceeds from our public stock offerings  which proceeds were invested primarily in tax exempt  short term municipal bonds  commercial paper and us government securities 
the increase in interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the investment of the proceeds from the follow on public offering of our common stock in november provision for income taxes income tax expense represented combined federal and state income taxes at an effective rate of for and for the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the non deductible amortization expenses related to the human code acquisition and to expansion into countries and states with higher tax rates 
equity in net loss from unconsolidated affiliates equity in net loss from unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
in october  we acquired a non controlling equity interest in di  a japanese company 
in september  we commenced a joint venture  sapient 
table of contents spa  in milan  italy  in which we have a non controlling interest 
we use the equity method of accounting for these investments 
the increase in the equity in net loss from unconsolidated affiliates was due to a full year of operations for sapient spa  for which our share of their losses totaled approximately  as compared to a partial year of operations in  offset by equity in net income from di of approximately  minority interest minority interest for the year ended december  was approximately  related to the interest in our japanese subsidiary acquired by di in october quarterly financial results the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for and in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have primarily funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations and the proceeds from our public stock offerings 
in addition  we have a bank revolving line of credit providing for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under this line of credit  which expires on august   bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit includes covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limits the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  at december  and at all times throughout  we had no bank borrowings outstanding 
letters of credit of million were outstanding under the agreement and were issued as security deposits for certain of our lease commitments 
there were no material capital commitments at december  the following summarizes our contractual obligations of non cancelable operating leases at december  in thousands thereafter we invest predominantly in instruments that are highly liquid  investment grade securities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily from a net loss of million  decreases in accrued compensation of million  deferred revenues on contracts of million and increases in unbilled revenues on contracts of million  offset by net non cash charges of million such as depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  loss recognized on write down of investments and stock based compensation  non cash restructuring charges of million  increases in accrued restructuring costs of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million  decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
overall  the change was primarily due to the significant decline in demand for advanced technology services in  which resulted in a net loss 
our days sales outstanding for accounts receivable has decreased from days for the year ended december  to days for the year ended december  due to increased management focus 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to sales and maturities of short term investments net of purchases of million  offset by capital expenditures of million for expansion of our foreign office locations and investments in and advances to affiliates of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as a result of cash provided from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options of million  offset by the repurchase of our common stock of  under a stock repurchase program announced in september under this program  we may repurchase up to million of our common stock over a one year period 
any purchases under our stock repurchase program may be made from time to time  in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
the total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities announced in march is expected to be approximately million 
the remaining million of restructuring and other related costs consists of non cash charges primarily for asset write offs and leasehold improvements for facilities being vacated 
as of december   million of cash had been expended for this initiative  of which approximately million was expended for lease termination payments 
an additional million cash outlay is expected during the year ended december   and the remaining cash outlay of approximately million  primarily related to real estate rental obligations  is expected to occur over the next ten years 

table of contents the total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities announced in july is expected to be approximately million 
the remaining million of restructuring and other related costs consists of non cash charges primarily for asset write offs and leasehold improvements for facilities being vacated 
as of december   million of cash had been expended for this initiative  of which approximately  was expended for lease termination payments 
an additional million cash outlay is expected during the year ended december   and the remaining cash outlay of approximately million  primarily related to real estate rental obligations  is expected to occur over the next ten years 
due to the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of on march   we will be able to carryback our tax net operating loss for us federal purposes to all previous tax years to including the million income tax receivable included in our consolidated balance sheet at december   we estimate that we will recover in approximately million of taxes paid in prior years 
as a result of the actions taken in february  we have estimated that we will spend approximately to million in cash for restructuring and other related activities in the year ended december  and beyond 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and borrowings available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  restructuring  and stock repurchase program requirements for at least the next months 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our market and the demand for business and technology consulting services have changed rapidly the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions have changed rapidly over the last three years  and we expect this rate of change to continue 
the market for advanced technology consulting services expanded dramatically during and most of  but both shifted and declined significantly in and to date in these market changes have required us to shift the focus of our services  from design and implementation of internet solutions to other strategic technology initiatives  and have also affected our financial results 
our revenues for the year ended december  decreased from our revenues for the year ended december   and our net income declined from million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  our quarterly revenues declined sequentially throughout the year  with our revenues for the three month periods ended march  june  september and december  decreasing   and  respectively  from each of the previous quarters 
we expect to experience a further decline in our revenues  with flat or declining operating results  for the quarter ended march   which could continue into future quarters 
if we cannot successfully adapt to these changes in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop service offerings that keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  evolving industry needs and changing client preferences 
our future success will also depend on our ability to develop and implement ideas that successfully apply existing and new technologies to deliver explicit business outcomes to our clients 
we may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or in selling our services in the marketplace 
our clients may continue to cancel or delay spending on technology initiatives because of the current economic climate since the second half of  many companies have experienced financial difficulties or uncertainty  and canceled or delayed spending on technology initiatives as a result 
this trend has continued and  for some 
table of contents clients  worsened since the september  terrorist attacks in the united states 
furthermore  the severe financial difficulties which many start up internet companies have experienced has further reduced the perceived urgency by larger companies to begin or continue technology initiatives 
if large companies continue to cancel or delay their business and technology consulting initiatives because of the current economic climate  or for other reasons  our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to be materially adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively the business and technology consulting market in which we operate includes a large number of companies and is highly competitive 
our primary competitors are large accounting and consulting firms and systems consulting and implementation firms 
we compete to a lesser extent with specialized e business consulting firms  offshore outsourcing companies  strategy consulting firms  other packaged technology vendors and internal information systems groups 
we compete frequently for client engagements against companies with far larger revenues and numbers of consultants than we have 
these competitors are often able to offer greater scale and breadth of products and services  which in some instances has enabled them to significantly discount their services in exchange for revenues in other areas or at later dates 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
businesses may decrease or delay their use of advanced technologies as a means for conducting commerce our future success depends heavily on the increased acceptance and use of advanced technologies as a means for conducting commerce and streamlining operations 
we focus our services on the development and implementation of advanced technology strategies and solutions 
if use of these advanced technologies does not continue to grow  or grows more slowly than expected  our revenue could be less than we anticipate and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
consumers and businesses may delay adoption of advanced technologies for a number of reasons  including inability to implement and sustain profitable business models using advanced technologies  inadequate network infrastructure or bandwidth  delays in the development or adoption of new technical standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of usage  delays in the development of security and authentication technology necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information  and failure of companies to meet their customers expectations in delivering goods and services using advanced technologies 
our growing international operations and global distributed delivery model subject us to increased risk we currently have offices in the united kingdom  germany  india  japan and canada and we have a joint venture in italy 
our international operations are growing as a percentage of our total operations  and our global distributed delivery model is a key component of our ability to successfully deliver our services 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  costs and management of staffing multi national operations  reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries  political instability or changes in regulatory requirements  and 
table of contents us imposed restrictions on the import and export of technologies 
in particular  our global distributed delivery model depends heavily on our office in new delhi  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india  pakistan or the surrounding countries could hinder our ability to successfully utilize global distributed delivery  and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our global distributed delivery model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated timeframe and budget for each project 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent and depreciation  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements most of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed timeframe contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed timeframe contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend heavily on a limited number of clients we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients for which we perform large projects 
in  our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  with two clients each accounting for more than of our revenues 
in addition  revenues from a large client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in any particular quarter 
as a result  we are dependent upon winning new projects from new or existing clients to 
table of contents replace completed projects 
the loss of any principal client for any reason or the inability to replace existing projects  including as a result of the acquisition of that client by another entity  our failure to meet that client s expectations  or that client s decision to reduce spending on technology related projects  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
termination by any client of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff which were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may not be able to adequately perform our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
although many specialized e business and other business and technology companies have reduced their work forces or slowed their hiring efforts  and although we reduced our work force in march  july and february  intense competition still exists for certain employees who have specialized skills or significant experience in business and technology consulting 
we may not be successful in attracting a sufficient number of these highly skilled employees in the future 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees is high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we are able to attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to adequately manage and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
almost all of our employees participate in one or more of our stock option plans as a component of long term incentive compensation  and many of the stock options held by current employees have exercise prices that exceed the recent trading range of our common stock 
a future prolonged decline or low stock price could result in reduced incentives for employees and in increased turnover 
we may not be successful in managing the levels of our workforce and our other resources since december   we have experienced significant declines in our revenues and subsequently reduced our workforce and other resources 
our workforce decreased from  full time employees at december  to  at december   primarily due to reductions in our workforce in march and july in february  we announced a plan to further reduce our workforce by employees to address the continued decline in our revenues  and we will be reducing our office space in each of our office locations in the united states 
we must devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
despite our recent restructurings  we have made  and will likely continue to make  significant expenditures to grow our business in certain areas  including our global distributed delivery model 
we also may be required to expend substantial managerial and financial resources in identifying and addressing those areas of our business which are not in sufficient demand by our clients 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
if we are unable to do so  the quality of our services and products  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and our achievement of key business metrics  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  announcements of unexpected operating results or estimates made by us or our competitors  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
government regulation could interfere with the acceptance of new technologies any new laws and regulations applicable to new technologies and electronic commerce that are adopted by federal  state or international governments could dampen the growth of new technologies  and decrease their acceptance as commercial media 
if this occurs  a significant number of companies may decide not to pursue technology initiatives  which could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years  we have completed five acquisitions and entered into one joint venture 
the anticipated benefits from these and potential future acquisitions and joint ventures may not be achieved 
for example  when we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to do business with us or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or become well integrated into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition  although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future  and  if asserted  these claims may be successful 
a successful claim against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our co chairmen and co ceos have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen of the board of directors and co chief executive officers  together own approximately of our common stock 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence  and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees our success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees  including messrs 
greenberg and moore 
our employment arrangements with messrs 
greenberg and moore and with our other key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of either of messrs 
greenberg or moore  or of the services of one or more of our other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if one or more of our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  in the event of the loss of any key employees  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge  practices or procedures by such employees 
although we require our employees to sign agreements requiring them to keep company information confidential and prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in such actions or that these agreements will be substantially enforced by courts or other adjudicative entities 
furthermore  for those employees whom we involuntarily terminated in connection with our restructurings in march  july and february  we have waived the non competition clause of their agreements in exchange for other releases by these former employees 
we granted these waivers only in connection with the restructuring actions  and our general practice is not to waive the non competition obligations of other departing employees 
our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including a transaction in which stockholders would receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions include the following any action that may be taken by stockholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting and may not be taken by written consent  stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of stockholders or nominating a director for election  a chairman of the board or a chief executive officer are the only persons who may call a special meeting of stockholders  our board of directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the shares entitled to vote  and our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock 
provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill

the charge  if any  will be recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments 
at december   our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist primarily of fixed income securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio
