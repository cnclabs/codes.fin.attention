summary of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could be different from these estimates 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions  and estimates necessary in determining the related assets  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable that has been recognized as revenue which it may not collect 
the company analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions relating to future demand and market conditions 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the decrease in the allowance during fiscal was due to the physical disposal of excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions prove less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if required  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of the company relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
the cost of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights acquired is amortized primarily on the basis of the higher of units shipped over the contract periods through june or on a straight line basis 
the company assesses the recoverability of these rights on the basis of actual and forecasted production units as well as the average selling price and standard costs of the related products after the amortization of the rights to determine profitability 
if required  an impairment charge is recorded 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually under a two step approach  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
under the two step approach  the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value as defined in sfas no 
of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with its carrying amount to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded million of deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets as of june  for the future tax benefit of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on its tax returns 
significant components of the company s deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign loss and credit carryforwards  inventory reserves  employee severance and other costs 
the recognition of this tax asset is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax deductions 
the factors that the company considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this information  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  to reserve for those tax assets the company believes are not more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realized amount of net operating losses and other tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
warranty provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
the company actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve quality and minimize its warranty exposure 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company purchases materials from suppliers and sells its products around the world and maintains investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  it is exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
among the more significant potential risks to the company of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the united states dollar  the european monetary unit  swiss franc  british pound  japanese yen and korean won 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company began a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of lecroy or its subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of the company s foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
other than this program  the company does not attempt to reduce its foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs and it has no plans to do so in the near term 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  the company s financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
during fiscal  and  the company reported foreign currency exchange losses gains on assets or liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies and related foreign exchange forward contracts of million  million  and million  respectively 
at june  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of open foreign exchange forward contracts all with short term maturities of three months or less 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on its foreign exchange forward contracts and its assets or liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
in management s opinion  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments or  therefore  the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows
