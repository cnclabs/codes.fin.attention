critical accounting policies management has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
management believes that the allowance for loan and real estate losses is the critical accounting policy that requires estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are most susceptible to significant change

results of operations general 
the company reported net earnings of million  per diluted share  for the year ended june   compared to net earnings of million  per diluted share  and million  per diluted share  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and other income partially offset by an increase in other expenses 
net earnings for fiscal also included  of recaptured accrued taxes as a result of a favorable tax audit ruling 
without this tax recapture  net earnings for the year ended june  would have been million or per diluted share 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the million decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average earning assets to at june   compared to at june   partially offset by an increase in average earning assets of million during the year 
in addition  the million decrease in interest income was partially offset by million of adjustable rate mortgage loans that reached their floor rates  causing the adjustable rate feature on these loans to cease adjusting downward 
the million increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets of million and a corresponding increase in the average yield on earning assets to in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the million decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities from to  partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
the average cost of deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of certificates of deposit decreased basis points from for fiscal to in fiscal  while the average cost of core deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of fhlb advances decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the million increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in interest bearing liabilities of million and an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities of to 
net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a substantial reduction of the cost of interest bearing liabilities  which exceeded the reduction in the yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from the average yield on interest earning assets increasing more than the average cost of interest bearing liabilities and a reduction of the cost of interest bearing liabilities during the last quarter of fiscal provision for loan losses 
during fiscal  and  the company provided   and million  respectively  for losses on loans 
the  loan loss provision was established during fiscal as a result of the increase in the real estate loan portfolio of the company during the year 
the decrease in the provision for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal is primarily the result of favorable market conditions in the southern california real estate market with the continued increase in real estate values 
although there are signs of weakness in the national and certain california commercial real estate markets  to date the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio has not demonstrated such weaknesses 
demand for housing  particularly single family and multifamily housing in the company s primary lending area of southern california  remained strong during fiscal although the level of the company s nonperforming assets increased in fiscal  the increase was not considered significant  with the level of nonperforming assets sustained at de minimus levels  therefore  the company did not deem it necessary to increase the loan loss provision  given these factors 
management considers the level of nonperforming assets  the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate 
however  even though the local real estate market was strong during fiscal  there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the company will not have to establish additional loss provisions based upon future events 
other income 
other income increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal deposit fees increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a increase as a result of four additional retail banking branches and a continued program that began in the second quarter of fiscal  with efforts to attract checking accounts 
other income increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  with deposit fees increasing to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
in addition  other income for fiscal reflected gains on sale of loans of  compared to  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other expense 
other expense increased million to million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits  professional fees  fhlb prepayment penalties on advances and the opening of four new retail branch offices 
other expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  advertising and promotional expense  and the addition of three new wal mart in store branches during fiscal included in compensation and employee benefits were expenses related to the employee stock ownership plan esop 
companies that established an esop after are required to account for the expense of the esop at the fair value of the related shares released 
the expense related to the esop was million  million and million for each of the years ended june    and  respectively 
the following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and june  in thousands professional fees bank service charges miscellaneous loan expenses outside services stationery  printing and supplies telephone postage other income taxes 
income taxes increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to an increase in net earnings

financial condition the company s consolidated assets totaled billion at june   compared to billion at june  stockholders equity totaled million at june  compared to million at june  loans and mbs including assets held or available for sale increased to billion at june   from billion at june  loans originated and purchased for investment were million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period the previous fiscal year 
mbs purchased for investment increased to million at june   from million for the same period the previous year 
at june   the company s multifamily loan portfolio totaled million  or of gross loans  an increase of as compared to million  or of gross loans  at june   and its commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled million  or of gross loans  an increase of as compared to million  or of gross loans  at june  of the company s  of charge offs in fiscal  the majority was related to single family mortgage loans 
both because the size of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans comprising the portfolio were originated within the last five fiscal years  the company s past loss experience with respect to its commercial real estate loan portfolio may not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in the future 
see business allowances for loan and real estate losses 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depends on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
even though the southern california real estate market was strong in fiscal  recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in past years in the company s lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily and commercial real estate properties 
see business lending activities multifamily lending and commercial real estate lending 
loan sales increased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period ended june  the increase in loan sales is primarily a result of an increase in the origination of fixed rate real estate loans during a time of historically low interest rates 
loan pools purchased in fiscal included larger balance loans in the commercial and industrial loan category 
loans serviced for others decreased to million at june  from million at june  capital resources and liquidity regulatory capital requirements firrea and implementing ots capital regulations require the bank to maintain certain minimum tangible  core and risk based regulatory capital levels 
the minimum core capital requirement is for all but the highest rated savings associations 
see business regulation and supervision regulatory capital requirements 
the following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the bank at june  as indicated in the table  the bank s capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements 
june  tangible capital core capital risk based capital amount amount amount dollars in thousands regulatory capital required minimum excess capital in addition  fdicia required the ots to implement a system of regulatory sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized  with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution s capital 
under fdicia  the ots issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  differentiated by core capital ratio  level of core capital to risk weighted assets and risk based capital ratio 
see business regulation and supervision prompt corrective action requirements 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its core capital ratio to adjusted total assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is at least and its total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is at least 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the bank s regulatory capital at june  as compared to such ratios 
as indicated in the table  the bank s capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category

up to  additional shares could be repurchased in the future under the current authorization of the board of directors 
sources of funds and liquidity sources of capital and liquidity for the company on a stand alone basis include distributions from the bank 
dividends and other capital distributions from the bank are subject to regulatory restrictions 
see business regulation and supervision savings and loan holding company regulation payment of dividends and other capital distributions by the bank and market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the bank s primary sources of funds in fiscal were deposits  fhlb advances  principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the sale of loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank also has other potential sources of liquidity  such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short term assets 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows used by investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from net earnings and the sale of loans held for sale which totaled million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the company originated loans for sale of million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations  loan purchases and mbs purchases  partially offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on mbs and maturities of other investment securities 
loans originated and purchased for investment were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
proceeds from principal repayments on loans were million  million and million for years ended june   and  respectively 
proceeds from maturities and principal repayments of investment securities were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of fhlb advances 
the net change in deposits was an increase of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the bank opened four in store branches during fiscal and opened three in store branches during fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the bank purchased a retail branch office and million of deposits from another financial institution 
this branch is located in rowland heights  california 
the bank also opened three in store branches in wal mart stores during the second half of fiscal all of the bank s existing and planned wal mart in store branches are located in the southern california area 
in addition  while the vast majority of the bank s deposits are retail in nature  the bank accepted million in time deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal and an additional million in fiscal during fiscal  the bank s million in time deposits had come due and payable at various periods throughout the year and terms were renegotiated and reset at current market rates 
the bank considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and their levels are determined by management s decision as to the most economic funding sources 
the net proceeds from fhlb advances totaled million for fiscal the net repayments of fhlb advances were million for fiscal and the net proceeds from fhlb advances were million for fiscal at june   the company had million of total liabilities in advances outstanding from the fhlb compared to million of total liabilities at june  this increase was primarily a result of increases in real estate loan and securities portfolios 
the maximum amount of advances that the company had outstanding at any month end was million 
management anticipates that it may increase its level of borrowings from the fhlb in fiscal see business sources of funds borrowings 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and short term investments totaled million  an increase of from million at june  at june   the company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and no commitments to purchase loans 
at june   the company had million of approved undisbursed lines of credit 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination and purchase commitments 
certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities of one year or less from june   totaled million 
if a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity  the company s other sources of liquidity include fhlb advances  principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from loan sales and other borrowings  such as repurchase transactions 
the company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits  which could result in an increased cost of funds 
historically  the company has maintained a significant portion of maturing deposits 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment  these are not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity position of the company 
asset liability management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period compared to the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates therefore  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
in addition  a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of arm loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
additionally  the company s arm loans are predominantly tied to lagging market indices  and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
accordingly  interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income 
the company will also not benefit if interest rates increase due to arms currently at their floors that will not reprice upwards until the fully indexed loan rate once again exceeds the lifetime floor rate 
the company currently has approximately million of adjustable rate loans with fully indexed loan rates at  or below  the floor rates 
declining interest rates have  in general  benefitted the company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market indices which has resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense 
at june   the company s total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by million  representing a one year cumulative positive gap ratio of 
this compares to million at june   which represented a positive gap ratio of 
management believes that it is important to note that approximately million of current  arms that are included in the total of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year  have been prevented from downward resets as lifetime floor rates have constrained their repricing 
accordingly  should market rates rise  these assets will not reprice upwards until the fully indexed loan rate once again exceeds the lifetime floor rate 
this increase in the one year cumulative gap ratio is primarily a result of the increased prepayment speeds applied to the company s loan portfolio in future periods 
these increased speeds are assumed because recent decreases in market interest rates will likely result in customers refinancing and seeking lower interest rate loans 
the company s actual experience over recent months also supports this assumption 
furthermore  this decrease in rates has allowed the company to extend the maturities of many of its liabilities  including fhlb advances and certificates of deposit 
if interest rates increase significantly however  prepayment speeds will slow down and the positive gap will be reduced 
the company manages the resulting interest rate risk by extending the maturities of various liabilities such as fhlb advances and retail certificates of deposit 
the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
management has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which generally meets weekly and reports to the board of directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future 
the level of the movement of interest rates  whether up or down  is uncertain and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the asset liability committee and could be utilized in the future 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
specifically  the company assumed a prepayment rate ranging from to on arm loans  and to on fixed rate loans 
additionally  the company utilized deposit decay rate assumptions of for passbook accounts  for checking accounts and to for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category 
the range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts 
these decay rates are based upon the company s historical experience  but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates

certain certificate accounts have potential repricing dates which are prior to the contractual maturity dates 
the repricing dates were used for purposes of the gap analysis 
certain fhlb advances have call features which are prior to the contractual maturity dates 
the call dates were used for purposes of the gap analysis 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
included in loans receivable that are scheduled to adjust the rate in one year or less are approximately million of adjustable rate loans with various indices that have fully indexed rates that are at  or below  their lifetime floor rates 
although they are arm loans  should interest rates increase the interest rates on these loans will not increase until the fully indexed rate exceeds the lifetime floor rate 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
average balance sheet the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended june   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown except where noted otherwise 
average balances are derived from month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
the average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which the company has discontinued accruing interest 
the yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the asset liability committee and could be utilized in the future 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools 
one measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis under the caption md a asset liability management 
another measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at june   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a change in interest rates in basis points percentage change in net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management has focused its efforts on increasing the company s yield cost spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the total balance of expected maturities and principal repayments and the instruments fair values at june  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments

total balance equals the notional amount of off balance sheet items and interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying loans 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the company s average constant prepayment rate cpr on its total fixed rate portfolio ranges from to and on its adjustable rate portfolio from to for interest earning assets excluding investment securities  which do not have prepayment features 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and the company s own historical experience  decay factors were used to estimate deposit runoffs of   and between to for passbook  checking and money market deposit accounts  respectively 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s historical experience
