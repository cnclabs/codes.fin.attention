item business imp inc imp or the company designs  manufactures and sells integrated circuit ic semiconductor devices  also known as microchips 
the company s focus is on a specialized technology sector called the analog ic and mixed signal market 
imp sells its analog ic technology in two basic forms imp manufactures ic wafers for other semiconductor vendors using imp s own and customer developed processes which the company refers to as foundry services and imp designs  manufactures and sells standard analog power management ics which the company refers to as standard products 
foundry services have comprised the majority of imp revenues for the last decade 
following a downturn in imp s historic lines of business in fiscal  imp decided to expand its activities into the market for standard products 
imp s goal is to provide a broad portfolio of devices to manage the power supply needs of the portable  wireless and internet based systems that are driving today s computer and communications revolution 
the company s strategy builds on the historical strengths of imp s people  technology and manufacturing capabilities and is intended to serve a broad base of customers in a growing market opportunity 
imp s wafer production  design and research and development activities are located in san jose  california 
this facility is certified to meet the quality demands of the international standards organization specification number iso imp operates its own wafer fabrication plant in order to develop and control the specialized analog technologies that are essential for the design of products offering unique technical advantages to the customer 
imp was founded as a california corporation in january under the name of international microelectronic products  and reincorporated in delaware as international microelectronic products  inc in april the company s initial public stock offering was completed in in september  the company s certificate of incorporation was amended to formally change the name of the company to the commonly used abbreviation of imp  inc imp stock is traded on the nasdaq smallcap market under the ticker symbol of impxc 
imp s main offices are located at north first street  san jose  california imp can be contacted by telephone at  by fax at  and by e mail at info impinc 
com 
background imp was founded to employ proprietary computer aided engineering software to provide fast turnaround design and prototyping  as well as volume manufacturing services  for customer designed application specific ic asic devices 
the company was one of the first vendors to apply this design technology to complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processes 
in the early s  in order to offer fast turnaround and low 
table of contents cost  companies  including imp  had to build and operate their own wafer fabrication and testing facilities 
the company also used this capacity to provide wafer foundry services to semiconductor companies that did not own their own wafer fabrication factory or that needed additional capacity 
imp has delivered production wafers representing hundreds of millions of finished microchips to such customers as international rectifier  level one  linfinity  microsemi  teamasia semiconductors  and national semiconductor 
during the s  imp engineers created some of the industry s first standard cell based analog and mixed signal designs 
the company applied this analog expertise to the first non custom products sold under the imp name in the early s 
these were application specific devices  such as programmable filters  integrated read channels  preamplifiers  and write drivers  for applications in disk drive and pc tape back up mass storage systems 
customers for these products included hewlett packard  iomega  seagate technology  and the m corporation 
in early fiscal year  demand for imp s wafer foundry services and mass storage products declined at the same time that significant additional foundry capacity was brought on line throughout the world 
as a result  the company s sales dropped significantly 
management took many actions to reduce costs  including canceling non contributing products  freezing salaries  work force reduction and increasing the productivity of the remaining personnel 
in  a new imp management team made the decision to invest in the design of standard catalog analog products to help increase demand for its products 
the specific choice of analog power management ics was determined by the capabilities of the existing equipment  by the skills of the research and development personnel and by the long term growth opportunities forecast for these products 
in addition to matching these capabilities  these products are sold to a broad base of users throughout the world and were expected to reduce imp s historical dependence on a limited base of customers 
these analog products also had the potential to increase the profit that can be generated by each wafer 
the analog integrated circuit market integrated circuits are either digital or analog devices based on their mode of operation 
circuits combining both analog and digital modes on the same chip are known as mixed signal devices 
mixed signal devices are frequently employed to translate information presented as an analog signal into digital information and vice versa 
digital circuits generate a succession of high and low signal levels 
each level represents a one or a zero in binary arithmetic 
digital functions are most efficient at storing and processing signals inside a computer 
analog circuits process continuously varying signal levels that convey information about the value of some linear characteristic  such as the amplitude  phase  or frequency of voltage or current 
the continuously varying signals may represent real world properties such as temperature  pressure  weight or speed 
the analog integrated circuit market comprises those devices having a purely analog operating mode  as well as mixed signal devices having a high degree of analog content 
examples of analog devices include amplifiers  comparators  regulators and certain specialized functions used in power management applications 
mixed signal devices falling into the analog category  include disk drive read channels  data communications interface and data conversion devices  such as analog to digital adc and digital to analog converter dac products 
mixed signal chips with predominantly digital content  such as modems  pc audio  and graphics display functions are usually included in the market category of digital products 
from the s through the s  divisions of large semiconductor companies controlled the mainstream analog ic business 
while these companies are still dominant in terms of unit shipments today  especially in the area of circuits for tv  radio and other consumer products  the analog ic market is also served by a large number of independent  specialized high performance analog vendors 
some of these smaller vendors generate higher profit margins and market valuations than their much larger counterparts 
according to world semiconductor trade statistics wsts data  in calendar year  the worldwide analog ic revenue was approximately billion out of total integrated circuit sales of billion 
markets and applications digital signals are most efficient for manipulation of bits of data 
analog signals best represent the values of real world parameters outside of a computer 
analog components are therefore an essential element of every electronic system that must operate in a real world environment  from battery powered computers  mobile phones  pagers  hearing aids and hand held instruments to desktop computers  servers and mainframes to industrial equipment  automobiles and avionics 
a simple example of an application for analog devices is in a thermostatically controlled electric fan 
changes in room temperature are detected using a sensor and an amplifier and measured as an analog signal 
this signal is converted with an adc into a digital value for a microcontroller in the fan to determine when the motor should be turned on and at what speed 
when the decision is made  a dac then converts the digital output of the controller back into an analog signal which is then amplified to a high current level to drive the fan motor 

table of contents the customers for analog ics are manufacturers of electronic equipment serving numerous and widely differing applications in instrumentation  industrial control  data processing  military  video  medical equipment  and voice and data communications over private and public  local area and wide area network systems  such as the internet 
for each application  different users may have unique requirements for circuits with specific resolution  accuracy  linearity  speed  power  and signal amplitude capability  which results in a high degree of market complexity 
as a result  compared to the market for digital integrated circuits  the analog market is characterized by a wider range of standard products used in smaller quantities by a large number of customers 
further  many of these products have historically enjoyed longer life cycles  less competition from foreign manufacturers  lower capital requirements as a result of using more mature manufacturing technologies  and relatively stable growth rates 
an established analog ic supplier may offer hundreds of different basic device types  in numerous package variations and operating ranges  representing thousands of part numbers serving many different end market segments 
power management ics control  distribute  generate  monitor and regulate the supply of voltage and current  and provide electrical and thermal protection to an electronic system 
sia s report indicates an annual growth of for analog ic suppliers in calendar year analog ics were projected by sia to offer one of the most promising segments of the ic business because of their use in fast growing portable electronic systems 
imp products and services our revenues derive primarily from two types of activities wafer foundry and custom ic manufacturing services this is the original base of imp s business and in fiscal generated more than of our revenue 
we process silicon wafers using our specialized analog bicmos  cmos and dmos technologies for other semiconductor companies that do not own their own factory or who need additional capacity 
these customers usually design the products themselves 
processed wafers are round silicon slices that contain hundreds or thousands of completed microchips ready to be separated and assembled into individual packages 
this activity is commonly referred to as the wafer foundry business 
a number of older imp designed and owned products for tape based  mass storage systems are today essentially custom circuits because each is sold to a single customer 
power management ics these are new families of standard catalog microchips that improve the power consumption efficiency of a wide range of electronic systems 
we focus our research and development activity on low power and high voltage features for handheld and portable battery operated communication systems  such as pagers  cell phones  and electronic organizers 
in addition to communications systems  power management products are used in just about every piece of electronic equipment being designed today 
we introduced our first power management products in early fiscal and these products began to contribute to revenue in the third fiscal quarter of that year 
in fiscal  these products represented million  or approximately  and in fiscal represented million  or approximately  of our net revenues 
by following the approach outlined below  we are using our expertise in analog processing circuit design and high volume production to establish imp as a supplier of finished power management ics develop wafer manufacturing processes that enable the production of advanced analog devices 
our current development activities are addressing a variety of bicmos  cmos and dmos technologies  ranging from volts to several hundred volts in capability 
we are using these technologies for our own products as well as offering them to potential new foundry customers 
complete a portfolio of industry standard analog power management ic products  based on the new processes described above 
using customer feedback from our first round portfolio of products  develop follow on products to expand our offerings to meet continuously evolving customer requirements 
analog products require an extensive customer support network of application and systems engineers 
in order to expedite the sales of our standard products while we develop our network  we intend to work with industry leading merchant analog semiconductor manufacturing companies to leverage our standard products through their sales and marketing channels 
our future standard product development is focused on differentiated and value added products in cost  performance and service 
see research and development below for a list of new products introduced during fiscal sales  distribution and marketing 
table of contents the company sells its products both directly to oem customers  with the assistance of independent sales representatives  and indirectly through independent distributors 
in north america  during fiscal year and the company worked with various sales representative firms and distribution companies in the united states  canada and southeast asia 
in some cases  these organizations promote products that compete with our products 
in the fiscal years ended march  and  sales through our north american distribution outlets accounted for less than of net revenues 
as we proceed with our transition to sales of more standard analog ic products  we expect that our sales through distribution firms will account for an increasing percentage of net revenue 
as is customary in the industry  distributors are entitled to price rebates and product return privileges if the market outlook and the prices for our products change 
our sales to customers in the united states  asia and europe accounted for  and respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year  compared to   and respectively  of the company s net revenues for fiscal year  and  and respectively  of the company s net revenues for fiscal year our standard products are sold throughout the world  while our custom and foundry products are sold primarily to north american customers 
european currency issues are not material due to the company s minimal contact with european markets 
in fiscal year  our largest customers were linfinity microelectronics  international rectifier and national semiconductor  which accounted for approximately   and  of net revenues  respectively 
in fiscal year  international rectifier  linfinity microelectronics and national semiconductor accounted for    respectively  of net revenue 
in fiscal  international rectifier  level one  cms a subsidiary of hewlett packard and linfinity microelectronics accounted for approximately   and of net revenues  respectively 
outside north america  we sell our products through various channels  including independent sales representative  distributor  and stocking representative distributor firms 
these companies may buy and stock our products for resale or may act as our agent in arranging for direct sales from our factory to a customer 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
as a result  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar can increase the price in local currency of our products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than those of local manufacturers 
this could lead to a reduction in our sales or our profitability in those foreign markets 
we have not taken any measures  such as hedging currencies  to protect us against possible changes in exchange rates 
we do not expect the euro trends or issues to have a material effect on our revenues during fiscal our export sales are subject to some governmental restrictions  including regulations contained in the export administration act of and the export administration amendments act of however  we have not experienced any material difficulties to date because of these restrictions 
due to the relatively long manufacturing cycle for integrated circuits  we build some of our inventory in advance of receiving orders from our customers 
as a consequence of inaccuracies inherent in forecasting demand for such products  inventory imbalances periodically occur that result in surplus amounts for some of our products and shortages of others 
such shortages can adversely affect our relationships with our customers 
surpluses can result in larger than desired inventory levels 
our backlog consists of distributor and oem customer orders typically required to be shipped no more than six months following the order date 
our customers may generally cancel or reschedule orders to purchase products without significant penalty 
as a result  to reflect changes in their needs  our customers frequently revise the quantities of our products to be delivered and their delivery schedules 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty  we do not believe our backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
research and development the company s ability to compete depends  in part  upon its continued introduction of technologically innovative products on a timely basis and expansion of the current portfolio of existing standard products 
meanwhile  we have additional first generation standard products in the final stages of development 
because it generally takes between six months and two years to create a new standard product  it will take some time for products meeting our product competency standard to be introduced 
research and development in analog integrated circuits is characterized primarily by new process development  circuit design and product and test engineering contributions that enable new device functionality or improved performance 
our research and development efforts are also directed at improving and reducing the cost of existing manufacturing process technologies and products 
with respect to more established products  our research and development efforts also include product redesign  reduction of chip size and improvement in the yield of good die per wafer to reduce device costs 

table of contents as of march   we had nine people engaged in research and development 
our research and development efforts are dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified analog process  design  product engineering  test and applications engineers  of which there is a limited supply 
we also use independent contractors for certain research and development projects 
in fiscal years  and  we spent approximately million  million and million respectively  on research and development 
we expect to continue to invest funds in research and development activities 
our research and development programs are currently focused on the development of new power management analog ic products and enhancing and expanding our portfolio of cmos and bicmos processes with the greatest amount of resources concentrated in the area of ic product development 
during fiscal year we introduced the following new products to the market imp  imp  imp ldo low drop out voltage regulators

table of contents uart  duart  vme controller and tvs diode networks were added to the imp product portfolio 
these products were acquisitions from epic semiconductor  inc there can be no assurance that we will be successful in selling the new products introduced so far  or that we will be able to successfully complete the products currently in development 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to identify additional new product opportunities successfully and develop and bring to market such new products or that we will be able to respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
moreover  the end markets for our new products  such as the computer  communications and control markets  are subject to rapid technological change and there can be no assurance that as such markets change our product offerings will remain current and suitable for them 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  product or process obsolescence and price erosion in many markets 
we currently compete in the markets for analog silicon foundry services  application specific mass storage and data communications devices  and standard analog power management integrated circuit products 
currently  our principal competitors in the analog silicon foundry services market include american microsystems inc  a division of japan energy corporation  austrian micro systems  california micro devices  supertex  and tower semiconductor  as well as internal manufacturing facilities within our customers 
to a lesser degree we compete with large asian foundries  such as chartered semiconductor of singapore  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  and umc group of taiwan 
the principal competitive factors in the silicon foundry market include service  price  manufacturing capability  quality and manufacturing cycle time 
we believe that our competitive strengths arise from our experience in manufacturing specialized cmos and bicmos analog and high voltage process technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the market for analog ics is also intensely competitive with the competitive pressures expected to increase 
significant competitive factors in the analog market for standard products include product features  performance  price  the timing of product introductions  the emergence of new computer and communication standards  quality and customer support 
with respect to application specific mass storage products such as read channels  our principal competitor is texas instruments 
with respect to application specific data communications devices such as scsi termination devices  our principal competitors are maxim integrated products  microsemi microelectronics and unitrode  a division of texas instruments 
we plan to continue to supply our mass storage and scsi devices as long as a viable market remains for them 
however we are not currently developing any new products based on these technologies 
in the focus area of power management products  because the markets are diverse and highly fragmented  we encounter different competitors on different products 
our principal competitors include micrel  supertex  sipex  microchip  linear technology and maxim integrated products 
other competitors include analog devices inc  linfinity microelectronics  motorola  national semiconductor corporation  texas instruments  and certain european and asian manufacturers 
in addition  we have licensed technology from and to parties  which have  in certain cases  the right to use the technology to develop products competitive with ours 
our principal competitors and many of our potential competitors have substantially greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than we have 
we also face competition from smaller highly focused companies  although not all such companies have internal wafer manufacturing capability 
due to the increasing demands for analog circuits  we expect intensified competition from existing suppliers and from the entry of new competitors 
increased competition could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future  or that competitive pressure will not adversely affect us 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
patents and licenses we have been granted united states patents  one of which is jointly owned  and we have filed for additional united states and foreign patent applications on our inventions 
the issued patents expire between to although patents  patent protection and patent applications may have value  we believe that other factors such as managerial and technological experience and creative abilities of our personnel are of more significance in our industry 
there are five patents that apply to currently shipped products 

table of contents in the past we have entered into cross licensing agreements under which we have acquired certain products and rights to the technologies of our partners and our customers in exchange for the transfer of similar rights to our partners and our customers for royalties  up front fees or for other consideration 
we expect to enter into additional arrangements in the future 
because of technological developments in the semiconductor industry  it is possible that certain of our designs or processes may involve infringement of existing patents or patents that have not yet been issued 
from time to time  other companies and individuals have advised us that some of our products and technologies may violate their patent rights  mask work rights  copyrights or trademark rights 
we have signed agreements with two such parties to allow us to use their patents in exchange for royalty payments 
in fiscal year  lemelson medical foundation filed a claim against us and other semiconductor companies regarding alleged patent violations 
in december  we settled all claims with the lemelson medical foundation for  to be paid in three equal annual installments  the last of which is due in december  in exchange for certain licensing rights 
we paid the initial installment and subsequent to march   issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock to the lemelson medical foundation in lieu of paying the second 
we have acquired software and licenses to software from a number of software companies  primarily for computer aided design of our integrated circuits 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through proprietary information and invention agreements with our employees  and non disclosure agreements with appropriate customers and suppliers 
the non disclosure agreements generally have terms ranging from one to five years and may cover technical  financial  operational  sales or marketing information 
depending upon the circumstances  either mutual or one way non disclosures are covered by these agreements 
although we plan to protect our rights vigorously  there can be no assurance that our measures will be successful 
manufacturing during fiscal  all of the wafers we shipped directly or that were assembled as finished products were manufactured in our san jose  california facility 
this wafer manufacturing facility with full staffing has the capacity to produce up to  five inch wafers per month 
during the fiscal year  due to the reduction in staffing  the company revaluated the capacity of the company s fabrication facility 
management estimates the current capacity to be approximately wafers per week 
the maximum practical number of wafers may be less  or more  than this estimate at any specific time due to the number of masking levels or other critical process steps demanded by the current product mix 
we believe that our in house wafer fabrication facility provides us with the ability to produce competitive products because it allows close collaboration between our design and process engineers  provides control over wafer supply  offers the potential for lower manufacturing costs  and accelerates product introduction schedules 
during periods of low demand  the high fixed costs associated with our wafer fabrication factory have had a serious negative impact on our ability to run a profitable operation 
for example  during the first half of fiscal year  and all of fiscal years and  our operating results were negatively impacted due to low utilization of the factory 
during some of this time  we operated the factory at less than of capacity 
however management has made several adjustments to operations designed to lower costs to be profitable at lower utilization of the fabrication facility 
because of the unique nature of our manufacturing processes  it would be difficult for us to arrange for independent suppliers to make wafers for us in a short period of time 
if a fire  natural disaster  utility interruption or any other event prevents us from operating the factory for more than a few days  our revenue and financial condition could be severely impacted 
we believe that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our near term plans although prolonged problems with any specific piece of equipment could cause us to miss our goals 
at periods of peak demand in the past  we have subcontracted some production to outside foundries 
if this situation arises again there are a number of foundries which  given appropriate lead times  could meet some of our needs 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet our customers required delivery schedules 
we use subcontractors for a number of very specialized processing steps where our volume is not sufficient to justify purchasing and operating the equipment ourselves 
one example is growing special epitaxial layers of silicon on our wafers 
we purchase most of our raw materials  including silicon wafers  on a purchase order basis from a limited number of vendors 
if our subcontractors or our vendors are unable to provide these services or materials in the future  our relationships with our customers could be seriously affected and our revenues and financial condition could be severely damaged 
on those products where we provide finished devices to our customers  after the wafers are fabricated and tested at our san jose  california facility  they are sent to contract assembly houses to be packaged 
after the wafers are scribed and the individual die is packaged  the units are returned to 
table of contents us for final testing 
we then ship the completed devices to distributors and customers worldwide 
the company has initiated procedures and taken steps to perform testing and shipping functions at external vendors 
our products are packaged by a limited number of third party subcontractors in indonesia and other asian countries 
some of the raw materials included in these operations are obtained from sole source suppliers 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers both for assembly services and for materials  disruption or financial  operational  production  yield or quality assurance difficulties at any of these sources could occur and cause us to have severe delivery problems

fiscal year ended march  march  march  total revenues cost of revenue gross profit loss operating expenses r d design selling  general and administrative gain on disposal of fixed assets operating profit or loss other expense  net net profit loss net revenues 
net revenues in fiscal year decreased to million  from million in fiscal year net revenues in fiscal year decreased to million from million in fiscal year foundry product sales accounted for of net revenues in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the company is attempting to shift additional resources from foundry product sales to sales of the company s standard products 
the decrease in net revenues of foundry and standard products from fiscal year to fiscal year is primarily the result of general economic slowdown  weak business conditions and declining sales prices 
revenue decreased as a result of discontinued orders of foundry products from certain customers 
our sales to customers in the united states  asia and europe accounted for   and  respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year  compared to  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues for fiscal year  and  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues for fiscal year our standard products are sold throughout the world  while our custom and foundry products are sold primarily to north american customers 
in fiscal year  our largest customers were linfinity microelectronics  international rectifier and national semiconductor  which accounted for approximately  and  of net revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net revenues during fiscal year in fiscal year  imp s largest customers were international rectifier  with of net revenues  linfinity microelectronics with of net revenues and national semiconductor with of net revenues 

table of contents management expects improved overall margins due to the shift to standard product sales  new product introductions  better pricing from subcontractors and utilization of manufacturing capacity as the company adjusts production activities to meet the changing product demands 
however  while the company is working on programs to continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies  and achieve faster introduction of new and qualified second source vendor for products  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter difficulties due to delays with technology introduction  changes in product mix  unfavorable product mix  unfavorable manufacturing yields  or other manufacturing difficulties in the future 
gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal the reduction in cost of revenue is primarily due to the company s i focus on cost reduction and improved efficiency of the manufacturing process  ii significant reduction in headcount from approximately on march  to approximately at march  and iii shift to business with higher margins 
further  at march  the prior year end  the company recorded significant reserves against inventory due to the accumulation of slow moving inventory and the cancellation by a customer of a significant order 
the company has disposed of substantially all of this slow moving inventory during fiscal and is monitoring more closely its inventory levels to reduce to some extent the risk of accumulating slow moving inventory 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to lower factory utilization  selling price erosion and product mix changes on standard products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to cost reduction efforts  lower personnel related costs  and to a lesser extent  lower depreciation 
the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to cost reduction efforts  including a reduction in force 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal primarily reflects higher professional fees accounting and higher expenses related to the expansion of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal year decreased by  or  from fiscal year amounts 
this decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances 
interest expense increased from fiscal year to fiscal year by  or  primarily due to penalties and higher outstanding balances 
amortization of debt discount 
during the year  the company granted warrants in connection with the issuance of convertible debentures to teamasia 
the transaction also contained a beneficial conversion feature 
the value of the warrants and the beneficial conversion feature  totaling million  is reflected as a discount on the subordinated debentures and is being amortized over the term of the subordinated debenture which is one year 
for the fiscal year  a non cash charge representing the amortization of the discount associated with the warrant and the beneficial conversion feature  was recorded by the company 
other income 
other income includes interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous items 
other income of million includes income on the settlement of obligations at amounts less than carrying value 
included in other revenue in fiscal year is approximately  of previously accrued royalty obligations that were forgiven 
net income 
the company had a net income of  or per share  for the fiscal year  as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year  or per share  and a loss of million in fiscal year  or per share 
the fiscal years and net losses were primarily attributable to low factory utilization due to fluctuating market conditions  low product yield and higher expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to  from  at march  cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities in fiscal year were million  compared to cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities in fiscal of million and cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
cash and cash equivalents used in by investing activities in fiscal year were million  compared to cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities were million in fiscal year  compared to cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal year and cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities of million in fiscal as discussed more fully below  the company continues to experience severe liquidity problems and absorb cash in its operating activities and  as of march   the company has a working capital deficiency  is in default under the terms of certain financing agreements  is delinquent in the payment of its federal unemployment taxes  and has limited financial resources available to meet its immediate cash requirements 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
in fiscal year  the company adjusted offset receivables of million due from the holder of the convertible debentures against the convertible debentures and repaid  towards purchase of common stock 
the company made payments of million on capital lease obligations and million on its revolving credit facility 
in fiscal year  the company received proceeds of million from its revolving credit facility  including million in equipment notes payable  repaid million on the credit facility  repaid million of equipment notes payable  and made principal payments of million on capital lease obligations 
in addition  the company had proceeds from the sale of stock of million 
in april  the company entered into an agreement with the cit group for a million facility 
included in the facility were secured term loans for up to million for equipment purchases and a revolving credit facility that allows the company to borrow up to million based on qualifying accounts receivable and inventory balances at over prime 
in july  the cit group gave notice of termination and acceleration and demand for repayment for the revolving credit facility  including the equipment term loans 
as of march   there are no remaining balances outstanding under the revolving credit and equipment term loan financing arrangement with the cit group 
management is actively negotiating with several lenders to replace the cit group revolving credit facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was unable to meets its obligations under its equipment notes payable and certain of its capital leases 
these instances of non payment put the company in default of these agreements and in default of the revolving credit facility due to a cross default clause in the revolving credit facility agreement 
as of june   the company was in default of the revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations with an aggregate total balance of  during fiscal year  management actively negotiated with the company s creditors 
as a result of these negotiations  and from proceeds from sales of stock in june and convertible debentures in november and december to teamasia totaling  the company was able to bring current  pay off  or refinance certain of its debt and lease obligations 
as of march   the company remained in default of its revolving credit facility and equipment notes with an aggregate balance of  as of march   the company s current portion of debt and capital lease obligations of million is comprised of i  of equipment notes  and ii million of capital lease obligations the capital lease obligations are comprised of nine individual leases  all of which are past due 
as of march   the company s long term portion of capital lease obligations are nil as compared to march  the company s long term portion of debt and capital lease obligations of million at march   is comprised of  of capital lease obligations and million of convertible debentures due in june  extended up to august  the capital lease obligation is comprised of four lessors that account for the outstanding long term portion of the capital lease obligation 
in fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement with teamasia whereby teamasia agreed  among other provisions  to extend the due date of million of convertible debentures until august in addition  under the agreement  subba mok llc  an investor group led by the chairman of the board of directors purchase stock representing of the company s fully diluted equity for million 
all proceeds were received by july  at march   the company owed to the internal revenue service irs approximately  in federal unemployment taxes  including approximately  in delinquent taxes  penalties and interest 
the company has had discussions with the irs in an effort to reach a mutually agreeable payment schedule 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to reach a mutually agreeable settlement or  in the event that such a settlement is reached  that the company will be able to comply with the payment terms of such settlement 
management has initiated several actions designed to improve the liquidity problems and maintain profitability 
these actions include a reduction of headcount from personnel to personnel  the transfer of wafer testing services overseas and the consolidation of all operations in one building 
these actions also include yield improvement and strengthening of the sales force to increase revenues generated by our standard 
table of contents products 
in order to further improve the cash flow  the company has issued shares of stock to certain of its vendors in lieu of making cash payments 
management believes these measures will enable the company to continue operations 
however  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in sustaining the company and additional actions may be necessary  including obtaining additional equity contributions 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available 
factors affecting future results the company has minimal financial resources and its operating needs in fiscal were funded principally from the collection of accounts receivable and from the sale of common stock to subba mok llc 
in the event cash flow from account receivable is reduced or interrupted by slow collections  or by a decrease in revenue generation  the company will be unable to meet its obligations 
the company s independent auditors stated in their auditors report that the company s severe liquidity problems raise substantial doubt about whether the company can continue as a going concern 
the company continues to focus on restructuring its operations to conserve cash 
the company has reported operating income for the fiscal year and losses for the previous years starting from these losses continue to affect the cash flow 
our cash balance has decreased over each of the last several quarters 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  the company sells its products to distributors and manufacturers in southeast asia  which is currently experiencing an economic downturn 
sales in this region accounted for of the company s net revenues in fiscal year 
the company experienced a slight growth in revenues from this region during fiscal year 
however  should the region not be able to overcome its economic problems  there is no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely affected 
as a result of the severe downturn in the semiconductor market  the company experienced a significant drop off in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and subsequent quarters of fiscal year the reduced sales and corresponding reduction in cash flow has compounded the company s liquidity issues 
the downturn in the semiconductor market is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  though imp s revenue has stabilized due to a slight increase in revenue of its standard products 
in june  international rectifier corporation ir notified the company that it would be canceling future orders 
the final shipments of product to ir was expected to occur in august ir continues to do business at reduced revenue with the company 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company will have to continue investing in advanced design tools  manufacturing equipment and process technologies 
the company will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing to satisfy its cash needs and such financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations would be materially adversely affected 
new products and process technologies require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
although we are not currently a party to any material litigation relating to patents and other intellectual property rights  because of technological developments in the semiconductor industry  it may be possible that certain of our designs or processes may involve infringement of existing patents 
we also cannot be sure that any of our patents will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patents  maskwork rights  or copyrights on certain of our products and technologies 
although we are not currently a party to any material litigation  if a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license were not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost and a drain on our limited resources  may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state  and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that its activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in penalties being imposed on the 
table of contents company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
there can be no assurance that regulatory changes or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement will not render compliance more difficult and costly 
any failure of the company to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject it to significant future liabilities 
effective april  our common stock was moved from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market where it continues to trade under the symbol impxc 
our common stock trading price remains below per share and could also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which require additional disclosure by broker dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally  any non nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements could discourage broker dealers from trading in our common stock 
additionally  future announcements concerning the company  its competitors or its principal customers  including quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations or litigation may cause the market price of the company s common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions or international currency fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
on july   the company attended a hearing with nasdaq representatives to discuss the delisting of the company s common stock from the exchange 
the reasons for the delisting hearing include low stock price over a continued period of time  late filings of forms k and q and the financial weakness of the company 
as a result of this hearing  the company agreed to meet certain filing deadlines in connection with its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  maintain certain financial requirements and complete a reverse stock split 
the company does not know whether it will be able to maintain its nasdaq listing 
the ability of the company to transition from the fabrication of lower margin products to higher margin products  including both those developed by the company and those for which it serves as a third party foundry  is very important for the company s future results of operations 
rapidly changing customer demands may result in the obsolescence of existing company inventories 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts to keep pace with changing customer demands 
in this regard  the ability of the company to develop higher margin products will be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to retain its engineering personnel due to the company s current business climate 
many of our competitors have substantially greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than we do 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than our competitor s products that are denominated in local currency 
we expect continued strong competition from existing suppliers and the entry of new competitors 
such competitive pressures could reduce the market acceptance of our products and result in market price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failure  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the majority of our costs of manufacturing are relatively fixed  and  consequently  the number of shippable die per wafer for a given product is critical to our results of operations 
if we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  or if we experience product shipment delays  or if we encounter capacity constraints  or issues related to volume production ramp ups  our financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
we have from time to time in the past experienced lower than expected production yields  which have delayed product shipments and adversely affected gross margins 
moreover  we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
we manufacture all of our wafers at our fabrication facility in san jose 
given the unique nature of our processes  it would be difficult to arrange for independent manufacturing facilities to supply such wafers in a short period of time 
any inability to utilize our manufacturing facility as a result of fire  natural disaster or utility interruption  otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
although we believe that we have adequate capacity to support our near term plans  we have in the past subcontracted the fabrication of a portion of our wafer production to outside foundries  and may need to do so again 
at the present time  there are several wafer foundries that are capable of supplying certain of our needs 
however  we cannot be sure that we will always be able to find the necessary foundry capacity 
due to the relatively long manufacturing cycle for integrated circuits  we build some of our inventory before we receive orders from our customers 
because of inaccuracies inherent in forecasting the demand for such products  inventory imbalances periodically occur that result in surplus amounts of some of our products and shortages of others 
such shortages can adversely affect customer relationships  and surpluses can result in larger than desired inventory levels 
our backlog consists of distributor and oem customer orders required to be shipped within six months following the order 
table of contents date 
customers may generally cancel or reschedule orders to purchase products without penalty 
as a result  to reflect changes in their needs  customers frequently revise the quantities of our products to be delivered and their delivery schedules 
because backlog can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty  we do not believe our backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
in addition  our backlog includes our orders from domestic distributors as to which revenues are not recognized until the products are sold by the distributors 
such products when sold may result in revenue lower than the stated backlog amounts as a result of discounts that we authorize at the time of sale by the distributors 
the company utilizes various external silicon wafer service foundries for epitaxial growth and assembly sites to assemble and package its products 
any product delivery delays  quality and manufacturing problems from these external operations could adversely affect the company s operating results 
we depend on a number of subcontractors for certain of our manufacturing processes  such as epitaxial deposition services 
if any of these subcontractors fails to perform these processes on a timely basis  there could be manufacturing delays  which would materially adversely affect our results of operations 
currently  we purchase certain materials  including silicon wafers  on a purchase order basis from a limited number of vendors 
any interruption or termination of supply from any of these suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
our products are packaged by a limited group of third party subcontractors in southeast asia 
certain of the raw materials included in such products are obtained from sole source suppliers 
although we are trying to reduce our dependence on our sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of any of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as is common in the industry  independent third party subcontractors in asia currently assemble all of our products 
in the event that any of our subcontractors were to experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in our supply  our operating results would be adversely affected until alternate subcontractors  if any  became available 
the present and future success of the company depends on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified senior management  sales and technical personnel  particularly highly skilled semiconductor design and development personnel  and process engineers  for whom competition is intense 
the company is currently engaged in an executive search to hire a chief financial officer and a controller 
the loss of key executive officers  key design and development personnel  or process engineers  or the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain these employees 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amended or modified certain issues discussed in sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
and sfas no 
establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statements also require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
at this time  the company does not engage in derivative instruments or hedging activities 
accordingly  there was no impact on the company s financial statements from the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized sfas no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible asserts apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfa no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas no 
 that the company reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill base on the criteria in sfas no 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
sfas no 
is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas no 
requires the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
the company is also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas no 
at this time  the company does not expect that the implementation of sfas no 
will have any material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the retirement obligation of an asset 
sfas states that companies should recognize the asset retirement cost  at its fair value  as part of the cost asset and classify the accrued amount as a liability in the balance sheet 
the asset retirement liability is then accreted to the ultimate payout as interest expense 
the initial measurement of the liability would be subsequently updated for revised estimates of the discounted cash outflows 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  the company does not expect that the implementation of sfas will have any material impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes the sfas no 
by requiring that one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and by broadening the presentation of discontinued operation to include more disposal transactions 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at this time  the company does not expect that the implementation of sfas will have any material impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventory values  financing operations  warranty obligations  order cancellation costs  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
basis of presentation 
the company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
we continue to experience severe liquidity problems and absorb cash in our operating activities and  as of march   we have a working capital deficiency  are in default under the terms of certain financing agreements  are delinquent in the payment of its federal unemployment taxes  and have limited financial resources available to meet our immediate cash requirements 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
component revenues are recognized as products are shipped  at which time title transfers to the customer  except for sales through distributors  which are recognized on a sell through basis 
design and engineering service revenues are recognized under design and engineering contracts as defined development phases are completed by us and accepted by the customers 
in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab no 
 no revenue can be recognized unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility is probable 
we adopted sab no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  effective beginning of fiscal year the adoption of sab no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
sales return allowance 
the company reduces sales for estimated returns of products 
the sales return allowance is based on our historical experience 
allowance for bad debts 
the company maintains an allowance for bad debts based on estimated unrealizable account receivables 
management estimates the allowance based on an analysis of specific customers  taking into consideration the age of the past due account and an assessment of the customer s ability to pay 
inventory 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to market and or manufacture the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous 
table of contents periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the company has various debt instruments outstanding that mature by june  certain of these instruments have interest rates that are based on associated rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment  such as the prime rate 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subjected to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company estimates that a five percent increase in interest rates would cause interest expense to increase by an immaterial amount 
due to its international sales  the company is exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
those exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive  reducing the demand for the company s products 
a decline in the demand of the company s product could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial position  or liquidity 
european currency issues are not material due to the company s minimal contact with european markets 
at march   the company had approximately million of outstanding obligations under capital lease arrangements 
as the lease payments associated with these arrangements do not have variable interest rates  an increase of percent in short term would not have material impact on the company s net income or cash flows 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
since the company does not have any significant exposure to changing interest rates  the company did not undertake any specific actions to cover exposure to interest rate risk and the company is not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the company did not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk 
all of the company s financial transactions are conducted in us dollars
