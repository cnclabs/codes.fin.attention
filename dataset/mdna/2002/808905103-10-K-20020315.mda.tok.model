item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this report on form k 
the following discussion also contains forward looking statements about our plans  objectives and future results 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  and we assume no obligation to update this information 
realization of these plans and results involves risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are limited to those set forth under risk factors in this report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel treatments for cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases 
our disease based technology platform integrates expertise in protein biology with computational and medicinal chemistry to identify novel targets and rationally design small molecule compounds for large markets with unmet medical needs 
we launched natrecor following us food and drug administration  or fda  approval of natrecor for the treatment of acute congestive heart failure  or chf  on august   and recorded sales of million for the year ended december  we are focused on the development of three product candidates  natrecor for the treatment of acute congestive heart failure  scio  an oral  small molecule inhibitor of p kinase for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra  and novel small molecule inhibitors of the receptor for tgf beta  a cytokine that has been implicated in diseases characterized by chronic scar formation  or fibrosis 
results of operations years ended december    and revenues product sales 
total product sales were million for the year ended december   and none for the years ended december  and in  million of product sales were derived from one time sales of bulk fgf to kaken following the product approval of fiblast spray in japan 
these sales are not expected to recur 
the remaining product sales resulted from the launch of natrecor following fda approval in august and recorded million of product sales in research and development contract revenues and royalties 
research and development contract revenues and royalties were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  contract revenues primarily reflect our research collaboration agreements with eli lilly company of million 
in addition  we received royalty payments totaling million from sales of fiblast spray in japan by kaken  and from sales of diagnostic bnp testing by biosite and abbott laboratories 
the decrease from to of million was primarily due to the end of our research collaboration agreement with dupont pharmaceutical company  effective november the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to million in one time milestone payments received in from corporate partners chiron corporation and novo nordisk a s  million in clinical research funding from bayer ag and million in royalty payments from genvec  guilford pharmaceuticals and other research collaboration agreements 
research and development contract revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of the company s collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one year are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
the company s ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on its ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that such relationships will be established or that current research and development contract revenues will not decline 
psychiatric product sales and co promotion commissions 
psychiatric product sales and co promotion commissions for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to the sale of marketing rights for certain psychiatric products to gsk and the termination of the license agreement in march at the same time  the company dissolved its psychiatric sales and marketing division  and deployment of the psmd sales force 
the decline in product sales from to of million was largely the result of reduced distributor inventories caused by manufacturing and product shelf life issues of eskalith cr one of five products manufactured by gsk that were sold by the company  coupled with the erosion of sales as a result of new market entrants and generic drugs 
gain on sale of marketing rights 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  we solicited and received bids regarding the sale of our exclusive marketing rights for certain gsk psychiatric products sold by us 
the marketing rights were eventually sold to gsk 
the marketing rights were originally licensed from gsk under a licensing agreement 
in order to effect the sale  the licensing agreement was terminated effective march   and we received from gsk million in and million in and expect to receive a final payment of million in we recognized a gain on the sale of the marketing rights of million related to the sale in costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales were million for the year ended december  and none for the years ended december  and the expenses were mainly due to the cost to manufacture and distribute natrecor and royalty on a cross license agreement 
in addition  we classified in cost of product sales royalty payments to the limited partners of biotechnology research partners  ltd 
on revenues generated from the one time sales of bulk fgf shipments to kaken  and the cost of shipping bulk fgf to kaken in japan 
all costs associated with the manufacture of natrecor bulk drug product and finished products to which title transferred to us prior to fda approval  on august   was expensed as research and development 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily due to increased expenses related to our p kinase inhibitor  tgf beta  and natrecor programs 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to the increased clinical expenses related to natrecor and increased research expenses related to our p kinase inhibitor program 
during   and  we spent million  million  and million  respectively on research and development 
below is a summary of these costs by major project in millions 
natrecor scio tgf beta alzheimer s fgf other research total research and development we spent million on natrecor in the cost in was primarily for the development of natrecor for the treatment of chf for new indications and costs to approve the drug with the fda 
future costs are unknown  as we will continuously develop other therapeutic uses of natrecor for chf and fda approval of clinical study programs is difficult to estimate 
if we are not successful we will not be able to expand the market potential for natrecor 
we have spent approximately million in research and development expenses on the development of natrecor since the program began in we spent million on the scio program in the cost to complete the research for scio is unknown because it is a new clinical candidate 
this program is highly dependent on fda approval of the clinical study programs and ultimate fda approval to market the drug 
we recently started phase iia trials and have spent approximately million in research and development expenses since the program began in if we are not successful we will not be able to expand into the rheumatoid arthritis market 
we spent million in the tgf beta program in the cost to complete the research for tgf beta is unknown because it is a new clinical candidate and we have spent approximately million in research and development expenses since the program began in we have not commenced human clinical trials and this program is highly dependent on fda approval for clinical studies and ultimate fda approval to market the drug 
we spent million on the alzheimer s program in the alzheimer s program  which included a research collaboration with eli lilly  ended on december  there were severance costs of approximately  related to the termination of certain scientific personnel  which were incurred in fiscal year we expect no other future expenses in this program 
we spent million in in other research expenses 
other research expenses represent costs associated with general research that is not directly chargeable to a project 
we expect these costs to continue as we identify new candidates to enter clinical trials 
we expect substantial expenses in the research and development area during the next several years 
we are unable to predict the level of spending until near the end of the various programs because of the uncertainty of fda approval of clinical study programs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to sales and marketing expenses to launch natrecor and the addition of general and administrative staff to support the increase in overall headcount 
these sales and marketing expenses include the building of a marketing infrastructure  the cost of a person sales force and management team  the commissions to the sales force on natrecor sales  and the expenses of promotional and marketing programs 
the million increase from to was primarily the result of natrecor pre launch activities  a proxy contest in early  outside consulting expenses relating to strategic planning  increased headcount and bonuses paid during the period 
restructuring charges 
we incurred a restructuring charge in of million resulting from a corporate reorganization  which included the closure of our mountain view manufacturing facility and a reduction in our workforce 
all restructuring activities were complete by the end of the second quarter of  leaving a remaining balance of million in the restructuring reserve 
this unused reserve primarily resulted from changes in the estimates of the cost of workforce reductions and the gain on the sale of excess capital assets that were unanticipated 
the reserve was credited to restructure expense in the second quarter of other income expense 
net other income expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was largely due to lower interest expense of million  realized gains on securities of million and a decrease in other expense of million 
interest expense was lower in due to a lower debt balance and lower interest rates on the genentech debt 
the decrease in other expense was largely due to the write off and investment value adjustments for securities in neurocine and genvec in the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to the net gain on the sales of securities in guilford 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our operations and capital requirements have been financed primarily with the proceeds of public and private sales of common stock and preferred stock  research and development partnerships  collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical firms  product sales and investment income 
at december   our combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities both current and non current totaled million 
in january  we entered into a sale and marketing alliance with innovex  a subsidiary of quintiles transnational corp 
as part of the original three and one half year agreement  pharmabio development  inc  an affiliate of innovex  agreed to fund million of our costs to launch natrecor over the first months of the commercialization of natrecor and to loan us up to million 
in december  scios  innovex and pharmabio amended the january agreement 
the amendment will enable scios  at its option  to assume control of the natrecor sales force in june  one year ahead of schedule  and we eliminated the million line of credit provided by pharmabio to scios 
of the million funding from pharmabio  we received million in the fourth quarter of  and will receive the remaining million over the next months 
as part of the funding agreement  we will pay pharmabio a declining royalty rate on net sales of natrecor through early we also granted pharmabio a fully vested warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants are exercisable over the next months beginning december through may in december  we entered into a binding summary of terms with glaxo group ltd  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  or gsk  in which we will license natrecor to gsk in all european markets 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk will have the rights to sell and distribute the product for which we will receive an up front fee and milestone payments totaling pounds million british pounds which at december  equaled approximately million us dollars  in addition to future royalties in the identified countries 
we will manufacture and supply the bulk product to gsk 
both companies will work together to continue clinical development of natrecor in europe 
in order to obtain european approval for natrecor  gsk expects to use the extensive clinical data we submitted to obtain approval from the fda in august the companies expect to launch natrecor in europe in the first half of no revenue has been recognized related to this agreement through december  we have million due to genentech at december  of which million can be repayable in the company s series b preferred stock at anytime through december  in addition  if the company should decide to convert the loan to preferred stock  a portion of the loan that is not convertible will become due and payable before december  the amount of the loan that is due before the maturity date is based on a formula that considers the amount of loan converted to stock and the outstanding loan balance 
net cash used in operating activities of million in was primarily attributable to the loss of million and decreases in net operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million 
for  net cash used by operating activities amounted to million 
this was primarily attributable to the net loss for the year of million  partially offset by non cash charges related to depreciation  and amortization of deferred compensation totaling million  and million of cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
for  net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to funding net operating losses  partially offset by non cash expenses and increases in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is primarily a function of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities of million in consisted of purchases of property and equipment of million  and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided in investing activities was million in and consisted of net sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of fixed assets of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million in consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of fixed assets of million  offset by proceeds from the sales of facilities and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in was due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  a payment from pharmbio of million under the innovex agreement  the collection of stockholders notes receivable of million  partially offset by repurchase of scios stock of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for was mainly due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and collection of notes receivables from stockholders of million  partially offset by the payment of notes payable of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in was largely due to proceeds from notes payable of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of million 
we expect that the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in june  together with our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  proceeds from existing collaborations  including our agreement with pharmabio  and revenues from the sales of natrecor will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
in the event we will need additional financing for the operation of our business  including the commercialization of our products currently under development  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets 
income taxes at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not used 
our state net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not used 
these net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards provide an additional source of liquidity only to the extent that profitable operations are achieved prior to the expiration of the carry forward periods 
the use of losses generated through the date of our merger with nova pharmaceuticals corporation may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts  rebates and returns 
we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
scios did not have any business combination transactions in the year ended december  in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which in scios case is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
the company does not currently have any goodwill or intangible assets  and does not believe that the implementation of sfas will have any significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting of impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal year beginning after december  we believe sfas has no impact on scios financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of our business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
however  through our money manager  we maintain management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques as well as other procedures to review interest rate risk 
assuming a hypothetical interest rate increase of  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially incurred a loss of  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited to our supply contract for natrecor  which is denominated in the euro  and license and milestone payments from gsk  which are denominated in the british pound 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar payments could adversely affect our manufacturing costs 
changes in the exchange rate between the british pound and us dollar could adversely effect our earnings performance 
all of our other contracts are denominated in us dollars 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may change over time as our business evolves and our products are introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
our long term debt with genentech of million has a variable interest rate at the prime interest rate 
our exposure is the fluctuation in the prime interest rate over the next months 
an increase in prime interest rate will increase our interest expense on the debt
