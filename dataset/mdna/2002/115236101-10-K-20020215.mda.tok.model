item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we are a general insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
since the early s  our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least every year 
we have increased revenues from million in as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  we increased net income from million as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
we have also increased net income per share or more for nine consecutive years  excluding the effect of a one time investment gain of million in and favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves of million in and million in since  excluding the historical impact of poolings  our pre tax margins improved in all but one year  and in that year  the pre tax margin was essentially flat 
these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business and continued operating efficiencies 
our growth in was primarily the result of a higher than historical number of acquisitions  driven in large part by the then anticipated elimination of pooling of interests accounting treatment for acquisitions  coupled with a general increase in premium rates and stronger net new business growth 
our revenues are comprised principally of commissions paid by insurance companies  fees paid directly by clients and investment income 
commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance underwriters and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units  which are units that insurers use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values  sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the policyholder 
these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors  including reinsurance rates  none of which we control 
beginning in and continuing through  revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurers for market share 
among other factors  this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates  commonly referred to as a soft market  generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business 
the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production 
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through  there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of although premium rates vary by line of business  geographical region  insurance company and specific underwriting factors  we believe this was the first time since that we operated in an environment of increased premiums for eight consecutive quarters 
additionally  in light of the events of september   insurance companies  as well as reinsurers  may extend this trend of increasing premium rates 
while we cannot predict the timing or extent of premium pricing changes as a result of market fluctuations or their effect on our operations in the future  we believe that premium rates will continue to increase through at least the volume of business from new and existing clients  fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues 
for example  stagnant rates of inflation and the general decline of economic activity in recent years have generally limited the increases in the values of insurable exposure units 
conversely  the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
still  our revenues continue to grow through acquisitions and an intense focus on net new business growth 
we anticipate that results of operations for will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions 
we also earn contingent commissions  which are revenue sharing commissions from insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth and or profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year 
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year  and over the last three years  have averaged approximately of total commissions and fees 
contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received 
the term core commissions and fees excludes contingent commissions and represents the revenues earned directly from each specific insurance policy sold or from fee based services rendered 
fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party administration  consulting for the workers compensation and employee benefit self insurance markets and managed healthcare services 
in each of the past three years  fee revenues generated by the services division have averaged approximately of total commissions and fees 
investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies 
our policy is to invest available funds in high quality  short term fixed income investment securities 
investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 
acquisitions and the impact of the pooling of interests method of accounting during  we acquired the following agency groups in stock for stock transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting the huval companies spencer associates  inc and san of east central florida  inc 
the young agency  inc layne associates  ltd 
agency of insurance professionals  inc  compvantage insurance agency  llc and agency of indian programs insurance  llc finwall associates insurance  inc the connelly insurance group  inc the benefit group  inc logan insurance agency  inc and automobile insurance agency of virginia  inc 
froelich paulson moore  inc and m j buildings  llc mckinnon mooney  inc raleigh  schwarz powell  inc we also acquired the assets of general insurance agencies  several books of business client accounts and the outstanding stock of two general insurance agencies in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
during  we acquired the following four agency groups in stock for stock transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting bowers  schumann welch the flagship group  ltd 
wmh  inc and huffman associates  inc 
mangus insurance bonding  inc we also acquired the assets of five general insurance agencies  several books of business and the outstanding stock of two general insurance agencies in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
during  we acquired the following two agency groups in stock for stock transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting ampher insurance  inc and ross insurance of florida  inc 
signature insurance group  inc and c  s d  a florida general partnership 
we also acquired the assets of seven general insurance agencies  several books of business and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the revenues and expenses of entities that were acquired and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting are recognized only from the date of acquisition  and therefore did not impact our previously reported historical results 
however  the applicable accounting rules require that our consolidated financial statements be restated for all periods to include the results of operations  financial positions and cash flows of entities acquired in transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
because most of the pooled entities were operated as privately held companies that paid significant year end bonuses and compensation to their principals and owners during the periods prior to our acquisition of such entities  the combination of their lower net income results with our results diluted our historically reported profit margins  defined as income before income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of total revenues 
as restated  our profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
without giving effect to any acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method in the year of acquisition or in any prior year  our profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
we believe that  as we continue to integrate these acquired entities  our profit margins will continue to improve 
the pooling of interests method of accounting has been eliminated for all business combinations initiated after june  this change in accounting rules was the impetus for many of our acquisitions in the pace of our ongoing acquisition activities may be significantly slower than it was in  although we will continue to seek qualified acquisition candidates 
future acquisitions will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our acquisitions 
the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations for the years ended december   and commissions and fees commissions and fees increased in  in and in core commissions and fees increased in  in and in  excluding commissions and fees generated from operations acquired that were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and excluding divested operations 
the and results reflect stronger premium rate increases that began in the first quarter of and continued through additionally  the increase was impacted by the higher than historical number of acquisitions consummated during that year 
during  property and casualty insurance premium prices declined from the previous year  and this decline was primarily responsible for the lower growth rate 
investment income investment income decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in is primarily a result of lower available investment cash balances due to increased acquisition activity  although lower investment yields also contributed to reduced income 
the increase in was primarily a result of higher levels of invested cash 
investment income also included gains of approximately million in  million in and million in realized from the sale of investments in various equity securities and partnership interests 
other income other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets 
in  gains of million were recognized from the sale of client accounts that were primarily related to the auto dealer protector plan r  based in central florida 
gains from the sale of client accounts were million in  compared with gains of million in this decrease from to was primarily due to the gain on sales of certain accounts in within the lawyer s protector plan r of our national programs division 
employee compensation benefits employee compensation and benefits increased approximately in  in and in  primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid to new and existing employees 
employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in the percentages are higher in and due to higher compensation and year end bonuses paid to the principals and owners of pooled entities prior to the dates of acquisition 
we had approximately  full time employees at december   compared with approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  other operating expenses other operating expenses increased in  in  and in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in and in the continuing decline in other operating expenses  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by an initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense  and to the fact that  in an increasing premium rate environment  certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent  office supplies and telephone costs  increase at a slower rate than commission and fee revenues increase during the same period 
depreciation depreciation increased in  in and in these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computer equipment and the depreciation associated with acquired assets 
amortization amortization expense increased million  or  in  million  or  in  and million  or  in the increase each year is due to the additional amortization of intangibles as a result of new acquisitions 
see notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  in  and decreased million  or  in on january   we obtained a million term loan  primarily to acquire the insurance agency business related assets of riedman corporation  which accounts for the increase in the average london interbank offered rate libor for the interest paid on that loan in was 
effective january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of for the remaining six years of the term loan  excluding our credit risk spread additional interest paid to offset risk of default between and 
the decrease in was the result of reduced outstanding debt 
non cash stock grant compensation non cash stock grant compensation expense represents the expense required to be recorded under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  relating to our stock performance plan  which is more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the annual cost of this stock performance plan increases only when our average stock price over a trading day period increases by increments of or more from the price at the time of the original grant  or when more shares are granted and the stock price increases 
during  after the first vesting condition for most of the previously granted performance stock was satisfied as a result of increases in our average stock price over a trading day period  we granted additional shares of performance stock 
with the awards granted in and the increase in our stock price during that year  the expense for the stock performance plan increased to million in from million in if our stock price continues to increase in  this expense could increase to as much as million  excluding the cost of any new shares granted 
income taxes the effective tax rate on income from operations was in  in and in results of operations segment information as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we operate in four business segments the retail  national programs  services and brokerage divisions 
the retail division is our insurance agency business that provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  governmental  professional and individual clients 
over of the retail division s revenues are commission based 
as a majority of our operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate  we believe that a majority of any fluctuation in commissions received by us will be reflected in our pre tax income 
the retail division s revenues accounted for to of our total consolidated commissions and fees over the last three years 
the retail division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting that had no comparable revenues in the remaining increase is primarily due to net new business growth  which benefited from rising premium rates during income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over this increase is due to acquired revenues  increases in premium rates and the lack of comparable year end bonuses paid in related to the pooled entities 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over this increase is primarily due to net new business growth and rising premium rates during income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over this increase is due to net new business growth  acquired revenues and rising premium rates

similar to the retail division  essentially all of the national programs division s revenues are commission based 
total revenues in increased million to million  an increase over  of which million was related to net new business growth 
all of this net new business growth was related to our special programs division  but was partially offset by the loss of approximately million of auto industry related business that was terminated 
revenues related to our professional programs division were essentially flat for  however  prior to  we experienced at least three years of to of annual revenue declines in this business 
income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over  due primarily to net increases in revenues

similar to our retail and national programs divisions  essentially all of the brokerage division s revenues are commission based 
total brokerage revenues in increased million to million  a increase over  due entirely to net new business growth 
as a result of the brokerage division s strong net new business growth  income before income taxes and minority interest in increased million to million  a increase over brokerage revenue in increased million to million  a increase over  solely due to net new business growth 
income before income taxes and minority interest for increased million to million  a increase over  again due to net new business growth

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities the current ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the current ratio in is primarily attributable to the use of cash and increased debt to fund the higher level of acquisition activity 
in january  we entered into a million seven year term loan agreement with suntrust banks  inc borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the  or day libor plus a margin ranging from to  depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ninety day libor was as of december  the loan was fully funded on january  and a balance of million remained outstanding as of december  this loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly principal installments of million through december effective january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with suntrust banks  inc to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of for the remaining six years of the term loan  excluding our credit risk spread between and 
we also have a revolving credit facility with suntrust banks  inc that provides for available borrowings of up to million  with a maturity date of october borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the  or day libor plus a margin ranging from to  depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
a commitment fee of to per year is assessed on the unused balance

we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investment portfolio  funds generated from operations and the availability of the bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of additionally  we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs  including the required annual principal payments on our long term debt 
in december  a universal shelf registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission covering the public offering and sale  from time to time  of up to an aggregate of million of debt and or equity securities  was declared effective 
the primary use of this capital would be to fund acquisitions
