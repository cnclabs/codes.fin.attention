item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that reflect our current estimates  expectations and projections about our future results  performance  prospects and opportunities  including statements related to our strategic plans  capital expenditures  industry trends and financial position 
in some cases  you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  plan  would and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are set forth in this report under the caption risk factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred costs and revenues  depreciation of broadcast equipment and other fixed assets  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with installing new customer sites 
based on staff accounting bulletin sab  we amortize these amounts over an estimated three year average life of a customer relationship 
if a significant number of our customers leave us before the estimated life of each customer is attained  amortization of those deferred costs and revenues would accelerate  which would result in net incremental revenue 
we incur a relatively significant level of depreciation expense in relationship to our operating income 
the amount of depreciation expense in any fiscal year is largely related to the estimated life of handheld  wireless playmaker devices and computers located at our customer sites 
if our playmakers and servers turn out to have a longer life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly reduced in those future periods 
conversely  if the playmakers and servers turn out to have a shorter life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly increased in those future periods 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we do not have any of the following o off balance sheet arrangements o certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
o relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from any non independent relationship other than the related party transactions discussed in item certain relationships and related transactions

at december  there were approximately  digital sites installed compared to  sites at december  these decreases were offset by an increase in internet service provider charges of approximately  due to additional services needed to support the digital network compared to the dos based network 
advertising commissions also increased approximately  partly due to an increase in advertising revenue and also due to the recognition of non refundable advances upon cancellation of a contract

interest expense increased  or  to  in from  in primarily due to interest expense recorded for additional capitalized leases acquired in and interest on the revolving line of credit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital current assets in excess of current liabilities of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  net cash provided by operations was  in and  in our net loss from operations was more than offset by depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges in both years

convertible senior subordinated notes as of december   we had outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes of  payable february  and bearing interest at per year 
the notes permit us to convert up to the full principal amount into shares of our common stock at maturity at a conversion price of per share 
in addition  if our common stock closes above for more than consecutive trading days  we can force conversion of the notes at per share 
if we default under the notes  the holders of the convertible notes could declare the entire outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable in full 
the convertible senior subordinated notes were originally issued in january for a principal amount of  and carried an interest rate of in exchange for our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes of  payable on february  effective on december   we agreed to permit the holders of the notes to convert  of the outstanding principal amount into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share in order to increase our stockholder equity 
as a result  the holders received an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we agreed to increase the interest rate on the remaining outstanding principal of the convertible notes was increased to from per year 
revolving line of credit in august  we entered into an agreement with coast business credit for a revolving line of credit not to exceed  interest is charged on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum  but cannot be less than per annum 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
total loan fees of  were payable in three annual installments and are being amortized over the life of the loan  which originally matured on august  our revolving line of credit agreement with coast business credit was amended in may the line of credit provides for borrowings not to exceed the lesser of i a designated maximum amount  ii three times trailing monthly collections  or iii three times annualized trailing adjusted ebitda 
the amendment called for a gradual reduction in the line from  on april  to  on december  we completed that pay down process on december  as of december   we had  available under the revolving line of credit 
our availability under the revolving line of credit may be further reduced if our monthly collections or operating income falls below certain levels 
the amendment to our revolving line of credit in may also allowed equity raised by us to be added to the ebitda calculation and permit us to exclude the effect of sab for the may amendment also required us to raise  in equity by june   maintain a minimum cash level of  each month and limited our cash burn to not more than  from april  onward without receiving additional equity 
the maturity date on the line of credit was also moved forward by two months to june  as part of the may amendment 
the investment in buzztime by an affiliate of scientific atlanta in june satisfied the  equity requirement 
on february   we further amended our revolving line of credit 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the revolving line of credit to june  the amendment also requires further line reductions of  each on june   january   and on march  the amendment deleted our minimum tangible effective net worth financial covenant and replaced it with two cash flow oriented covenants 
in return for the extension  coast business credit will receive a loan fee of  on july  investment in buzztime on june   an affiliate of scientific atlanta invested  in buzztime for  shares of its preferred stock  representing of buzztime s capitalization on an as converted basis  and warrants to obtain an additional  shares of its preferred stock 
each share of buzztime preferred stock is initially convertible into one share of buzztime common stock and entitled to a non cumulative dividend of  if  when and as declared by buzztime s board of directors 
in connection with the investment  buzztime entered into a development  license and marketing agreement with scientific atlanta to co develop an application to enable operation of a buzztime interactive trivia game show channel on scientific atlanta s explorer digital interactive set top network for distribution by cable operators to their subscribers 
the  in net proceeds may only be used towards development of the application for scientific atlanta and fulfillment of buzztime s obligations under the development agreement 
we granted scientific atlanta the right to exchange its shares of buzztime preferred stock into shares of ntn common stock if i buzztime does not obtain additional equity financing of  before june   ii the liquidation  dissolution or bankruptcy of buzztime before june   iii the failure of buzztime to conduct a qualified public offering by june   or iv a change in control of buzztime before june  the exchange price will be the day average closing price of ntn s common stock immediately preceding the date scientific atlanta gives notice of its intent to exercise its rights 
the exercise price of the scientific atlanta warrants is per share 
however  the warrants vest in increments only as cable system operators sign on for the buzztime game show channel 
future financing needs our requirements for additional financing in will depend upon the growth of our two business segments 
in a low growth scenario for example  net site growth of sites in the ntn network and a number of commercial trials of the buzztime initiative  utilization of our existing line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements 
if we face more rapid growth in either or both segments  then we will require additional financing in if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing  some initiatives relating to those higher growth opportunities may have to be curtailed or deferred 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
we are also considering adding to our product line certain other wireless applications that are relevant to the hospitality industry 
we may add these incremental hospitality products through reseller arrangements or through acquisition 
our limited capital resources may prevent us from making such an acquisition on a cash basis 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations at january  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
during the quarter ending march  to accomplish this  we must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require us to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  we will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
we currently do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions during the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
risk factors that may affect future results our business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following we have experienced significant losses and we expect to incur significant net losses in the future 
we have a history of significant losses  including net losses of  in   in and  in and an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating and net losses for the next four quarters due primarily to our continued development of buzztime 
our limited liquidity and capital resources may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
at december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately  we currently have a revolving line of credit agreement  which provides for borrowings of up to  and which expires on june  our availability under the revolving line of credit may be reduced if our monthly collections or operating income falls below certain levels 
as of december   the maximum of  was available to us and approximately  was outstanding under the line 
the maximum amount of the line of credit will be subsequently reduced to  on june    on january   and  on march  the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
our liquidity and capital resources remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
any reduction in availability under our revolving line of credit may further constrain our liquidity 
we will require additional financing to implement our plan to significantly expand the digital network and to develop buzztime into a leading content provider for interactive television platforms 
our requirements for additional financing in will depend upon the growth of our two business segments 
in a low growth scenario for example  net site growth of sites in the ntn network and a number of commercial trials of the buzztime initiative  utilization of our existing line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements 
if we face more rapid growth in either or both segments  then we will require additional financing in if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing  some initiatives relating to those higher growth opportunities may have to be curtailed or deferred 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we receive additional equity financing  it could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we do not comply with the american stock exchange guidelines and may be delisted or suspended from trading 
amex has published a set of continued listing guidelines that it follows to determine whether an amex listed company should be allowed to continue the trading or listing of its securities on the exchange 
under these guidelines  amex will consider suspending or delisting a company s securities from the exchange if it has sustained operating or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years and if shareholders equity falls below million 
we incurred a net loss of  in  representing our seventh consecutive year of losses 
as such  we are technically not in compliance with the continued listing guidelines of amex 
our equity is approximately  at december  and is expected to decrease with anticipated losses in in january we received correspondence from amex indicating that  despite the fact that ntn does not currently meet the guidelines  amex will continue the listing of our common stock pending periodic reviews by amex of our quarterly and annual sec filings and certain other financial information 
our most recent meeting with amex officials was in march to date  amex has not taken any action regarding delisting 
still  our common stock may not remain listed on amex or any other exchange or quotation system in the future 
if our common stock is delisted from amex  spreads can often be higher for securities traded on the over the counter market and the execution time for orders may be longer 
thus  removing our stock from amex may result in decreased liquidity by making the trading of our stock less efficient 
we are currently involved in litigation matters that could materially impact our profitability 
we are involved in two pending lawsuits in canada  both involving interactive network  inc both ntn and interactive network have asserted claims involving patent infringement and validity and certain other proprietary rights 
in january  plaintiffs submitted a request to the federal court of canada  trial division  in accordance with the court ordered deadline  for assignment of a pre trial conference date in may the request is currently pending with the court 
these actions affect only the operations of our canadian licensee and do not extend to our operations in the united states or elsewhere 
on february   a shareholder class action and derivative complaint was filed in san diego county superior court for the state of california by steven m 
mizel on behalf of himself and all of our shareholders naming robert m 
bennett  esther l 
rodriguez  barry bergsman  stanley b 
kinsey  gary h 
arlen  vincent a 
carrino and james b 
frakes as defendants with ntn communications as nominal defendant 
the mizel action alleges breach of fiduciary duty by defendants in connection with ntn s rejection of a proposal by a corporation to purchase all of the outstanding shares of our common stock  as announced publicly on february  plaintiffs request the court issue an injunction requiring defendants to fully and fairly negotiate the highest possible offer to purchase ntn  award attorney s fees  and grant such other relief as the court may find just and proper 
we believe this action is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest this action 
the foregoing claims may not be decided in our favor and we are not insured against claims made 
during the pendency of these claims  we will continue to incur the costs of our legal defense 
new products and rapid technological change may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we do not compete successfully in the development of new products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position 
the interactive entertainment and game industry is becoming highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
we are aware of other companies that are introducing interactive game products on interactive platforms that allow players to compete across the nation 
some of these companies may have substantially greater financial resources and organizational capital than we do  which could allow them to identify emerging trends 
in addition  changes in customer tastes may render our network  its content and our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
the emergence of new entertainment products and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products and services we develop 
accordingly  our future performance will depend on our ability to o identify emerging technological trends in our market  o identify changing consumer needs  desires or tastes  o develop and maintain competitive technology  including new product and service offerings  o improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to technological changes and compe titive offerings  and o bring technology to the market quickly at cost effective prices 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs 
such products and services may not gain market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology  including new product and service offerings  could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues 
we may sell equity interests in buzztime to third parties  which could result in the loss of control of buzztime or devaluation of our equity interest in buzztime 
in june we sold a interest in buzztime to an affiliate of scientific atlanta  a leading cable television set top box manufacturer 
we believe there may be divergent investment preferences between the strategies pursued by the ntn network and buzztime and may decide in the future to continue to raise additional financing by issuing and selling equity interests in buzztime to third parties 
to enhance the ability of buzztime to raise such financing  we have previously contributed and may contribute in the future some of our assets to buzztime in order to allow the development of a distinct identity that we believe is necessary for it to effectively grow as a separate concern 
these assets include our extensive trivia game show library and our interactive play along sports games and related intangible assets 
from an operational standpoint  we could lose control in buzztime 
if we lose control  buzztime may no longer provide adequate support and resources for content and programming for the ntn network affecting the ability of the ntn network to continue its operations 
from a financial viewpoint  we could undervalue the stock of buzztime when selling it to third parties or undervalue assets transferred to buzztime and this could devalue your holdings in ntn  because we would not receive the fair value for our interest in buzztime 
if our intellectual property does not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  our business could be seriously damaged 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in some of our products 
furthermore  it is our policy that all employees and consultants involved in research and development activities sign nondisclosure agreements 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights 
if we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim in the future to protect our proprietary rights  the litigation over such claims could be time consuming and costly to us  adversely affecting our financial condition 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
continued implementation of our business plan requires an effective planning and management process 
our anticipated future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we are to grow successfully  we must o improve our operational  administrative and financial systems  o expand  train and manage our workforce  and o attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
we make content available on our web sites and on the web sites of our advertisers and distribution partners 
the availability of this content could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories  including defamation  obscenity  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement 
we could also be exposed to liability for third party content accessed through the links from our web sites to other web sites 
we may incur costs to defend ourselves against even baseless claims  and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users 
if our chief executive officer leaves us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the efforts of our chief executive officer 
our ability to operate successfully will depend significantly on his services and contributions 
our business and operations may be adversely affected if he were to leave 
in january  we extended his employment agreement through october  risks associated with interactive television our prospects for growth depend on our implementation and use of our new digital network 
our digital network  introduced in april  has been installed in approximately  subscriber locations in the united states as of december  an additional locations in the united states and approximately locations in canada continue to subscribe to the original dos based ntn network 
we currently plan to continue operating our original ntn network and the digital network in the united states concurrently 
our immediate prospects for growth depend  in part  on our ability to add new product offerings and our sales effort 
the interactive gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive 
the entertainment business is highly competitive 
we compete with other companies for total entertainment related revenues in the marketplace 
our network programming competes generally with broadcast television  direct satellite programming  pay per view  other content offered on cable television  and other forms of entertainment 
furthermore  certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them 
with the entrance of motion picture  cable and television companies  competition in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify in the future 
in january  the walt disney company introduced interactive programming broadcast in conjunction with live sporting and other events  which competes directly with our programming 
we do not know of any direct impact on our operations to date 
we also compete with other content and services available to consumers through online services 
moreover  the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users with an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
with this increasing competition and rapidly changing factors  we must be able to compete on technology  content and management strategy 
if we fail to provide the quality services and products  we will lose revenues to other competitors in the entertainment industry 
we depend on a single supplier of playmakers r 
we currently purchase our megahertz playmakers from climax technology co 
ltd  an unaffiliated taiwanese manufacturer 
we are currently soliciting bids for the manufacture of our playmakers 
unless and until we succeed in establishing additional manufacturing relationships  we will continue to depend on our current sole source supplier of playmakers 
if we lose our supplier  our growth will slow until an alternative supplier is identified 
communication failures with our subscriber locations could result in the cancellation of subscribers and a decrease in our revenues 
we rely on both satellite and telephone systems to communicate with our subscriber locations 
interruption in communications with our subscriber locations under either system could decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services 
we are continually reviewing alternative telephone service providers and establishing contingency plans  however  such alternative providers and contingency plans have not been finalized 
we transmit our data to our hospitality customer sites via panamsat s galaxy iiir giiir satellite 
we were notified by the reseller through which we contract this service that panamsat s giiir satellite experienced a failure of its primary satellite control processor  or scp 
the scp is the principal computer for command and control of the satellite 
as expected and planned for in this event  the secondary scp took over control of the satellite with minimal interruption 
the satellite is currently operating normally and is stable but now has only one operable scp 
if the secondary scp were to fail  panamsat would lose control of giiir and it would become unusable 
also  giiir is the in orbit spare for another satellite  galaxy viiii 
if galaxy viiii were to fail  it is possible that ntn could lose the use of giiir 
our reseller states that panamsat has made it clear to them that it expects giiir to continue operating normally until it is replaced in the second quarter of and that it has a contingency plan for making replacement capacity available to us on another satellite in its fleet if giiir were to become unavailable 
in the event that we were forced to switch to another satellite  we would incur significant costs associated with re pointing its satellite receivers 
in addition  we could experience higher operating costs to transmit data to our customers via telephone lines and the internet during the transition period 
in order to provide some historical context to this risk  in  we were forced to switch from the satellite that we were then using to panamsat giiir since the previous satellite became inoperable 
that transition was completed in approximately two weeks 
another potential risk  as our country is at war  is the possibility that our government could pre empt a satellite for national security reasons  as the united states satellite operators are federally licensed 
this would appear to be unlikely as our government has a strong communications infrastructure in place domestically 
also  it is likely the satellite would not be at risk of being damaged by any of the physical aspects of the war due to the fact that the satellite orbits over  miles above the earth 
our games and game shows are subject to gaming regulations 
we operate online games of skill and change that  in some instance  reward prizes 
these games are regulated in many jurisdictions 
the selection of prizewinners is sometimes based on chance  although none of our games require any form of monetary payment 
the laws and regulations that govern these games  however  are subject to differing interpretations in each jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change in any of the jurisdictions in which we offer our games 
if such changes were to happen  we may find it necessary to eliminate  modify or cancel certain components of our products that could result in additional development costs and or the possible loss of revenue 
if our new buzztime programming is not accepted by consumers  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the new buzztime trivia channel programming faces risks as interactive television products and whether the market accepts interactive television 
if interactive television does not become a successful  scalable medium or if the market does not accept trivia and play along sports games  then we will be unable to draw revenues from advertising  direct marketing of third party products  subscription fees and pay per play fees 
we will also be unable to attract local cable operators to add buzztime programming as a channel to their service 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price has been highly volatile and your investment could suffer a decrease in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
the stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company  which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation requires a supermajority vote of at least of the total voting power  voting together as a single class  to amend certain provisions of such document  including those provisions relating to o the number  election and term of directors  o the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  and o the supermajority voting requirements of our certificate of incorp oration 
these provisions could discourage third parties from taking over control of our company 
such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interests 
if the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale are sold  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then prevailing market prices 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of february   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for the issuance upon the conversion of the senior convertible subordinated notes at a conversion price of 
at february   there were approximately  shares of buzztime s preferred stock that can be converted into ntn common stock at an exchange price of the day average closing price of ntn s common stock immediately preceding the date of notice to convert 
additionally  we have approximately million of common stock remaining under our existing shelf registration for possible future sale 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of these options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates  stock market fluctuations  and interest rates 
as of december   we owned common stock of an australian company that is subject to market risk 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  which is net of a  unrealized loss 
this investment is exposed to further market risk in the future based on the operating results of the australian company and stock market fluctuations 
additionally  the value of the investment is further subject to changes in australian currency exchange rates 
at december   a hypothetical decline in the value of the australian dollar would result in a reduction of  in the carrying value of the investment 
we have outstanding convertible notes which bear interest at per annum and line of credit borrowings which bear a rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum  which cannot be less than per annum 
at december   a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prime rate would result in an increase of  in annual interest expense 
we do not have derivative financial instruments
