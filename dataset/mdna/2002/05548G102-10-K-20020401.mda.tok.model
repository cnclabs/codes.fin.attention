item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction bkf operates entirely through levco  an investment adviser registered with the securities and exchange commission that was acquired by bkf in june levco specializes in managing equity portfolios for institutional and individual investors primarily in the united states 
most accounts are managed pursuant to a large cap value strategy  levco also offers a range of alternative investment products and other more specialized investment programs 
levco acts as the managing general partner of a number of investment partnerships and also acts as an adviser to private investment vehicles organized outside the united states 
with respect to accounts managed pursuant to its value equity strategies  levco generally receives advisory fees based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation and client contributions and withdrawals 
in some cases  levco receives performance based fees from accounts pursuing value equity strategies 
with respect to private investment vehicles and separate accounts managed pursuant to similar strategies  levco is generally entitled to receive both a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the assets under management and a share of net profits 
levco obtains some of its clients for its large cap value product through wrap fee programs sponsored by major financial services companies 
in these programs  clients pay the sponsoring broker an asset based fee that covers brokerage commissions  advisory services  custodial fees  and other reporting and administrative services 
investors are able to select levco from among a limited number of managers participating in the program  and levco receives a portion of the wrap fee paid by the clients who select levco to manage their accounts through the program 
at december   assets under management at levco were billion  compared to billion a year earlier 
following is a comparison of levco assets under management in millions as defined by product and client type december  december  december  institutional    sub advisory    non institutional    wrap fee    event driven   private investment funds total    levco also has a wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary that clears through csc on a fully disclosed basis 
generally  the customers of the broker dealer subsidiary are advisory clients of levco  and the trades executed through the broker dealer are generally placed by levco in its capacity as investment adviser 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations is based on the consolidated statements of financial condition at december  and  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and the pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and of bkf capital group  inc and subsidiaries which are included elsewhere herein and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements 
in light of the evolution of bkf from a closed end management investment company to a holding company whose primary asset is the investment management business of levco  pro forma consolidated financial statements have been included in this annual report on form k in order to provide meaningful comparisons of financial information for the years ended december   and a discussion of historical financial results of bkf as a closed end management investment company has not been included because bkf completed the distribution of substantially all of its assets on january  pursuant to a plan of distribution of assets approved by stockholders on august  and ceased to be registered as an investment company on april  particular attention should be paid to the fact that a change in accounting principle was effected on april  resulting in an amortization expense that has been reflected in the pro forma consolidated financial statements 
this amortization expense has been reflected on a pro forma basis in the consolidated financial statements for  and the consolidated financial statements for reflect the actual cumulative amortization charge absorbed by bkf in as the result of the change in accounting principle

results of operations year ended december  as compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in revenues in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in investment advisory fees excluding incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million to million  which increase was partly offset by a decline in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million to million 
the increase in investment advisory fees is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the large cap value strategy  which experienced a significant increase in assets managed in wrap fee programs  and the event driven product 
the decrease in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations is primarily attributable to a decrease in the performance of the accounts paying performance based compensation 
incentive fees and general partner allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed or allocated  as the case may be  at the end of the applicable contract year or upon investor withdrawal 
such accruals may be reversed prior to being earned or allocated as the result of investment performance 
other income  which is primarily net commission income generated by the broker dealer business  rose from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the assets under management of accounts that trade through levco securities 
expenses total expenses for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in excluding amortization of intangibles and restricted stock units granted and vested in  total expenses were million  reflecting an increase of from million in the largest component of this increase was a increase in compensation expense  which went from million excluding grants of restricted stock units to million 
the increase in compensation expense is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and the increase in compensation expense as a percentage of pre tax  pre compensation profits excluding certain costs incurred in connection with new product development under the compensation guidelines approved by the board of directors effective as of the beginning of such compensation guidelines were approved by the board of directors following consultation with independent compensation consultants 
occupancy and equipment rental for was million  reflecting an increase of from million in this increase resulted from lease amendments entered in the latter part of and in  which added a total of approximately  square feet and resulted in an additional rental expense of approximately  in bkf does not currently anticipate subleasing a significant portion of this additional space  as the company s management foresees continued growth in investment management and other personnel over the term of the lease 
other operating expenses of bkf for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in this increase primarily reflected an increase in portfolio management and trading system costs which bear a correlation to the number of accounts managed in wrap fee programs  professional and consulting fees paid to third parties providing marketing  legal and investment related services  and reimbursements to client accounts in connection with trading activities 
operating income operating income rose to million  up from  for  reflecting the increase in revenues  which exceeded the increase in expenses

as of year end  approximately million was invested in such strategies 
in  bkf had a net realized and unrealized loss on investments of  primarily as the result of the permanent write down of a historical private placement position that had been part of bkf s portfolio when it was an investment company 
this loss was partly offset by net gains in small cap which was terminated in august  small mid cap  and financial services long only equity value portfolios funded by bkf in the fourth quarter of in order to establish track records for developing products 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income was million in  reflecting a decline of from million in this decline resulted from a significant decline in interest rates  which was only partially offset by higher cash balances 
income taxes bkf recorded an income tax expense of million  net of a deferred tax benefit of  in  as compared to an income tax benefit of  in in  bkf realized a million capital loss for book purposes relating to an investment that was made when bkf was still an investment company  million of this loss was used in to offset taxable capital gains 
the balance of the unused capital loss was carried back to previous taxable years for federal income tax purposes to offset prior taxable capital gains 
such carry back resulted in a federal income tax refund of million  which is not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  but is reflected in the reduction of the deferred tax asset in the deferred tax asset in is primarily attributable to future tax benefits relating to future compensation deductions and unrealized partnership losses 
absent the non deductible amortization expense  bkf had an effective tax rate of in absent the non deductible amortization expense and the realization of the capital loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss by the investment company  bkf would have had an effective tax rate of in for the period ended december   application of a effective tax rate would have resulted in a provision for taxes of million 
this amount was offset by million in future tax benefits primarily attributable to million in future tax benefits from the unused portion of the capital loss  million in future tax benefits relating to future compensation deductions attributable to the grant of restricted stock units as the compensation expense is not deductible for tax purposes until the delivery of the underlying stock and million in future taxable income attributable to deferred revenue and unrealized gain on investments 
the difference in effective tax rates in and is primarily attributable to state and local taxes due to changes in the allocated income among various taxing jurisdictions 
pro forma year ended december  as compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in this increase was attributable to a increase in investment advisory fees excluding incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million excluding investment advisory fees received for managing the portfolio of bkf to million and a increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million to million 
the increase in investment advisory fees is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the large cap value strategy  which experienced a significant increase in assets managed in wrap fee programs  and the event driven product 
the increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the event driven product and approximately million in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from accounts or vehicles following the large cap value strategy or specialized investment strategies other than the event driven product which had not produced incentive fees or allocations in incentive fees and general partner allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed or allocated  as the case may be  at the end of the applicable contract year or upon investor withdrawal 
such accruals may be reversed prior to being earned or allocated as the result of investment performance 
other income  which is primarily net commission income generated by the broker dealer business  rose from million to million 
expenses total expenses for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in excluding amortization of intangibles  total expenses were million  reflecting an increase of from million in the largest component of this increase was a increase in compensation expense  which increased from million to million 
this increase in compensation expense is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and grants of restricted stock units to employees of the firm 
in connection with compensation and as part of broader incentive compensation program meant to retain and attract key employees  the compensation committee of bkf s board of directors approved grants of  restricted stock units to bkf employees 
these grants vested immediately and resulted in compensation expense of million in under the terms of the stock award agreements relating to the grants  the actual delivery of shares of stock will not take place for three years from the date of grant and will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions by the recipients 
other operating expenses of bkf in were million  reflecting an increase of from million in this increase primarily reflected an increase in marketing fees paid to third parties for soliciting investors on behalf of levco 
other factors contributing to the rise were increased promotional expenses relating to internal marketing efforts and an increase in portfolio management and trading system costs 
operating income operating income for was  reflecting a decline of from million for this decline reflected the increase in expenses  including the restricted stock unit grants  which exceeded the increase in revenues 
excluding the amortization of intangibles and the grant of restricted stock units  operating income was million  reflecting an increase of from million in interest and dividend income interest and dividend income in was million  reflecting an increase of from  in this increase in interest income resulted from four major factors increased cash generated by operations  the shift of a portion of compensation from cash to equity based instruments  a reduction in estimated tax payments resulting from the utilization of a portion of a capital loss  and the reclassification of the million bkf loan to levco to equity in december this reclassification enabled levco to cease making interest payments to bkf  resulting in higher cash balances for levco 
loss on investments in  bkf had a net realized and unrealized loss on investments of  primarily as the result of the permanent write down of a historical private placement position that had been part of bkf s portfolio when it was an investment company 
this loss was partly offset by net gains in small cap  small mid cap  and financial services long only value equity portfolios funded by bkf in the fourth quarter of in order to establish track records for developing products 
a pro forma adjustment to the financial statements eliminating investment company specific income resulted in there being no pro forma net loss or gain on investments in income taxes bkf recorded an income tax benefit of  in  as compared to a tax provision of million in in  bkf realized a million capital loss for book purposes relating to an investment that was made when bkf was still an investment company  million of this loss was used in to offset taxable capital gains 
absent the non deductible amortization expense and the realization of the capital loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss by the investment company  bkf would have had an effective tax rate of  which would have resulted in a provision for taxes of million 
this amount was offset by million in future tax benefits primarily attributable to million in future tax benefits from the unused portion of the capital loss  million in future tax benefits relating to future compensation deductions attributable to the grant of restricted stock units as the compensation expense is not deductible for tax purposes until the delivery of the underlying stock and million in future taxable income attributable to deferred revenue and unrealized gain on investments 
an effective tax rate of before amortization was used to calculate the provision for taxes at december  change in accounting principle a change in accounting principle that became effective on april  upon the de registration of bkf as an investment company resulted in a cumulative amortization expense derived from the acquisition of levco by bkf 
the de registration of bkf transformed bkf into an operating company and caused the transaction to become subject to purchase accounting rules 
this amortization expense is non deductible for income tax purposes because the purchase accounting method is being applied retroactively 
a one time charge to income in the amount of million for accumulated amortization from june through april  was recorded in the second quarter of this was a non cash charge 
liquidity and capital resources bkf s current assets as of december  consist primarily of cash  short term investments  advisory fees receivable and marketable equity securities 
while bkf utilizes capital to develop and seed new investment products  bkf s business is not generally capital intensive 
bkf has historically met its cash and liquidity needs through cash generated by operating activities 
at december   bkf had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  this increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the retention of operating income 
investment advisory fees receivable were million at december  and million at december   as an increase in assets under management was offset by a decrease in incentive fees 
the increase in investments in affiliated investment partnerships to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects the investment by bkf of million in conjunction with the development of four affiliated investment partnerships 
this amount was partially offset by the decrease in incentive allocations to levco gp  inc these incentive allocations typically are withdrawn within three months following the end of the calendar year to pay compensation and other expenses 
the decrease in deferred tax assets to million in from million in is primarily attributable to the million federal income tax refund received in as the result of the carryback of a portion of a million capital loss realized for book purposes in prepaid expenses and other assets declined to million at december  from million at december  as the result of the amortization of the pre paid premium on the three year directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance policy which is being financed by bkf over a month period 
investments in securities of million at december   as compared to million at december   represent investments made by the company to seed small mid cap and financial services long only equity value products and shares purchased in an affiliated offshore investment company 
accrued expenses were million at december   as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases in sales commissions payable to levco salespeople and in referral fees payable to third parties 
accrued bonuses were at million at december   as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues during and the increase in compensation expense as a percentage of pre tax  pre compensation profits under the compensation guidelines approved by the board of directors effective as of january other liabilities decreased to  at december  from  at december   primarily as the result of payments made on a loan used to finance bkf s directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance coverage  and a reduction in the amounts due with regard to pending trades in the seed capital portfolios 
based upon bkf s current level of operations and anticipated growth  bkf expects that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to finance its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
bkf s business is not seasonal 
except for the lease commitments and related expenditures described below  bkf has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has office space obligations that require monthly payments plus escalations through september at december   the minimum annual rental commitments under the operating lease are as follows thereafter  total minimum payments required  in addition  bkf anticipates that it will incur at least million in costs in connection with the expansion of its facilities  which costs will be amortized over the life of the lease 
off balance sheet risk levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which trade primarily in equity securities or  in the case of one partnership  in distressed corporate debt 
as of december   total partners capital in these partnerships was approximately million 
as of december   the sum total of levco gp s capital accounts in the affiliated investment partnerships was approximately million 
the financial condition and results of operations of these affiliated investment partnerships are not included in bkf s consolidated statement of financial condition except to the extent of levco gp s equity ownership 
levco gp does not maintain control over the affiliated investment partnerships  has not guaranteed any of the affiliated investment partnerships obligations  and does not have any contractual commitments associated with them 
in addition  limited partners in the affiliated investment partnerships have the right to make withdrawals on a quarterly basis 
related party transactions levco earned investment advisory fees from accounts for which four current members of bkf s board of directors of which one is an officer of the company have controlling discretion 
the amounts earned from these accounts were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these accounts are managed in levco s routine course of business and do not and will not impact bkf s current and prospective financial position and operating results any differently than similarly sized managed accounts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition with respect to incentive fees and allocations  bkf has elected to accrue income on a quarterly basis  though such fees and allocations are determined and billed or allocated at the end of the applicable measurement period 
such accruals may be reversed as the result of subsequent investment performance prior to the conclusion of the applicable contract year or investor withdrawal 
alternatively  bkf could have adopted a policy of not recognizing such fees or allocations until the respective payments are fixed at the end of the performance measurement period 
since most incentives fees or allocations are determined as of the end of the calendar year  the adoption of a revenue recognition policy that defers recognition of incentive fees or allocations and associated expenses could result in much lower levels of income  and associated compensation expenses  for periods prior to the fourth quarter 
bkf s annual financial results would not be materially affected  as most of the performance measurement periods conclude on december purchase price allocation in order to account for the acquisition of levco by bkf in utilizing the purchase method of accounting  levco s cost in excess of net assets was reflected in the following intangible items goodwill  employment contracts for key personnel and investment advisory contracts 
the total value of these intangibles at the time of the acquisition was million 
bkf has determined that of that amount was attributable to goodwill  to the employment contracts and to the investment contracts 
bkf amortizes the value of the goodwill over a year period  the value of the investment contracts over a ten year period  and amortized the employment contracts  which have all expired  over their respective terms 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  commencing in  the net carrying value of the goodwill of million at december   will cease to be amortized 
goodwill will be subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangible assets with finite lives  such as investment contracts  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
investments in affiliated investment partnerships levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which are not consolidated with bkf 
these general partnerships are periodically assessed to determine whether the underlying assets and liabilities should be consolidated 
see item off balance sheet risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since bkf s revenues are largely driven by the market value of levco s assets under management  these revenues are exposed to fluctuations in the equity markets 
management fees for most accounts are determined based on the market value of the account on the last day of the quarter with respect to which the investment advisory fee is charged  so any significant increases or decreases in market value occurring on or shortly before the last day of a quarter may materially impact revenues for the quarter 
furthermore  since levco manages most of its assets in a large cap value style  a general decline in the performance of value stocks could have an adverse impact on levco s revenues 
similarly  a lack of opportunity to implement  or a failure to successfully implement  levco s event driven strategies  could reduce performance based incentive fees and allocations and thereby negatively impact bkf s revenues 
in addition  as of december  and  bkf had invested and million  respectively  in seed capital for long only value equity products  which investments could be similarly impacted by a decline in the performance of value stocks  and and million  respectively  in proprietary alternative investment strategies  which are also exposed to market fluctuations
