item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this presentation includes the operations of our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries  unless we tell you otherwise 
results of operations from our inception in april through december  we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  selling  general and administrative expenses and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
we have increased our research and development budget since from approximately  annually to approximately  annually  however  we anticipate that our failure to successfully commercially develop our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies will force us to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
if we begin to market and sell any of our technologies  we will increase such expenses to the extent necessary  which we expect to fund out of revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in net losses can primarily be attributed to a substantial increase in amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the minority interest of medis el ltd 
in our june exchange offer for all of medis el s ordinary shares not owned by us 
research and development costs amounted to  for the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  research and development costs incurred during compared to were lower as a result of i non recurring expenditures aggregating  during the year ended december  relating to the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of additional shares of more energy ltd  our majority owned subsidiary for the development of fuel cells  ii non recurring charges of approximately  during the year ended december  relating to the write off of acquired in process research and development incurred in connection with the medis el exchange offer  allocated among the fuel cell  toroidal and stirling cycle technologies and iii a decrease of approximately  in costs relating to the cellscan during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these factors  however  were somewhat offset by an increase in spending on our fuel cell technologies during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  as mentioned above  our costs relating to the further development of our fuel cell technologies increased substantially in  even though in we incurred non recurring expenditures aggregating  relating to the acquisition of additional shares of more energy and a charge of approximately  from the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the medis el exchange offer 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement of the next generation cellscan system of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease is mainly due to less funds being devoted to collaborative research programs with third parties and procurement of materials for the cellscan 
these factors were partially offset by increases in salary and other related costs for research and development personnel and depreciation expense incurred in toroidal technologies and stirling cycle system 
we incurred costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor and the stirling cycle linear system of approximately  during year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  as described above  costs incurred in were higher than those in primarily due to non recurring charges during the year ended december  of approximately  from the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the medis el exchange offer  partially offset by increases in salary and related costs and other expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase can be primarily attributed to non cash charges of approximately  relating to stock options and warrants issued to officers  directors  employees and consultants for the year ended december  approximately half of such charges relating to the extension of the expiration date of outstanding options and certain warrants  compared to  during the same period in  as well as increases in salary and related costs and other expenses 
amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase during year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to amortization expense of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in relating to goodwill of approximately  and acquired technology assets of approximately  which was acquired upon the completion of the medis el exchange offer 
management believes that  as an additional operational measurement  earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  or ebitda  is useful and meaningful to an understanding of our operating performance 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income loss or cash flow data or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
items excluded from ebitda  such as depreciation and amortization  are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
all companies do not calculate ebitda the same way 
the computation of ebitda for the year ended december  and is set forth in the table below year ended december  net loss attributable to common shareholders   add value of warrants   add interest expense   less interest income   add amortization   add depreciation   ebitda   ebitda includes as an expense non cash compensation related to the issuance of stock options and common stock purchase warrants of approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   respectively 
the increase in the loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  occurred primarily due to reasons discussed earlier in this section  as well as the minority interest share in the losses of medis el of  for the year ended december  as compared to none in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained a net loss of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in net losses can primarily be attributed to increases in research and development costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of shares in the medis el exchange offer and costs related to the issuances of stock options and warrants 
research and development costs increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increases can be largely attributed to increased research and development activity pertaining to development of our dle m fuel cells  in which we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in costs in was partially due to i expenditures aggregating  to acquire an additional interest in more energy  which represents acquired in process research and development  and ii an allocation to fuel cell technologies of approximately  of the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the medis el exchange offer 
the further refinement of the cellscan  in which we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  development of the toroidal compressor  in which we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to none during the year ended december  development of the toroidal engine  in which we incurred costs of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in costs in was primarily due to an allocation to the toroidal engine of approximately  of the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the medis el exchange offer 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increase can be primarily attributed to non cash charges of approximately  relating to stock options and warrants issued to officers  employees  consultants and advisory board members  compared to approximately  in amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of amortization expense of approximately  during the year ended december  relating to goodwill approximating  and acquired technology assets approximating  acquired upon the completion of the medis el exchange offer 
the computation of ebitda for the years ended december  and is set forth in the table below year ended december  net loss attributable to common shareholder   add value of warrants issued  add interest expense   less interest income   add amortization   add depreciation   ebitda   ebitda includes as an expense non cash compensation related to the issuance of stock options and common stock purchase warrants of approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   respectively 
the increase in the loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  occurred due to increases in research and development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses for the reasons discussed earlier in this section  as well as a reduction of  in the minority interest share in the losses of medis el in compared to liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing  long term bank loans and grants to medis el from the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and commerce of israel with respect to the cellscan  initial sales of our products and fees from the granting of exclusive distribution rights 
in  we issued a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately  we used the proceeds of such offerings to fund the further research and development of our products and technologies and for selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  in the first quarter of  prior to the medis el exchange offer  employees  including medis el s executive vice president and vice president finance  and a director  exercised options to purchase an aggregate of  ordinary shares of medis el  for an aggregate exercise price of approximately  the proceeds of such option exercises were similarly used for research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not intend to cause medis el to issue any more of its shares to third parties  whether through the exercise of stock options or otherwise  as we intend that all future financings of medis el will be effected through us 
in may and june  we issued in private placements a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  for aggregate proceeds of  less issuance costs of approximately  additionally  between july and november  we issued  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately  the net proceeds of such issuances are being used for research and development projects with respect to our products and technologies and selling  general and administrative expenses 
on march   we completed a rights offering in which we issued to existing stockholders an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of  our estimated costs aggregated approximately  with respect to the rights offering  of which  was incurred in the net proceeds from the rights offering are being used for working capital  particularly for continued development of our dle m fuel cell technology  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in expenditures for research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses during the period for the reasons discussed above  partially offset by changes in operating asset and liability balances 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented  used to acquire an option to purchase the remaining of more energy we do not own and  for the purchase of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds of  from the disposal of property and equipment 
this is compared to  used in investing activities during the year ended december   which represented the acquisition of shares of medis el and more energy not owned by us aggregating  and the purchase of property and equipment of  partially offset by proceeds of  from the disposal of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  as discussed above  compared to  which was provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to funds raised from private placements of our securities and the exercise of medis el options  for aggregate proceeds of  partially offset by direct costs of the medis el exchange offer of  and the repayment of long term debt of  as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  as well as an unused  revolving credit line 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  and the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities 
another contributing factor is the status of collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
we believe that our cash resources  including proceeds from our recently completed rights offering  and funds available to borrow under our  revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operating and developmental activities for at least the next months 
beyond such time  we may require capital infusions of cash to continue our operations  whether through debt financing  issuance of shares or from companies or other organizations participating in the development of our technologies 
however  to the extent we are unable to raise or acquire additional other funds  we will curtail research and development of one or more technologies until such time as we acquire additional funds 
tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately us  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
also  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries have ever been audited by the united states or israeli tax authorities since incorporation 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el received approximately  in research and development grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures  with  of such funds being allotted for the cellscan and  allotted for the neuritor 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  medis el is required to pay of its sales of cellscan and neuritor products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if medis el sells the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aircraft its obligation relating to the repayment of grants of approximately  as of the date of this prospectus  medis el s total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  medis el is not presently receiving any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   medis el was issued a certificate of approval as an approved enterprise 
under the law  medis el elected the combined path  pursuant to which medis el had the right to receive a government guaranteed bank loan of of the amount of the approved investment 
in addition  medis el had the right to receive a grant of of the approved investment  in which case the loan would be reduced by the amount of the grant 
medis el received investment grants of approximately  and loans of approximately  the investment grants were used to invest in equipment  furniture and fixtures and commercial vehicles 
the loan proceeds were used for the above as well as to acquire know how  leasehold improvements  marketing and working capital 
the loans were paid off in full during the year ended december  additionally  the tax liability in respect of medis el s income deriving from its approved enterprise activities is calculated at a rate of of income for a ten year period  with tax on dividends distributed of  instead of 
these tax benefits expire in in september  more energy was granted approved enterprise status totaling  more energy is entitled to a tax benefit period of years on income derived from this program  as follows a full income tax exemption for the first six years and a reduced income tax rate of instead of the regular rate of for the remaining four year period 
if more energy distributes a cash dividend out of retained earnings which were tax exempt due to its approved enterprise status  it would be required to pay a corporate tax on the amount distributed and a further withholding tax would be deducted from the amount distributed to the recipients 
should more energy derive income from sources other than the approved enterprise programs during the relevant period of benefits  this income would be taxable at the regular corporate tax rate of 
the benefits from the approved enterprise programs depend upon more energy fulfilling the conditions under the grant and the laws governing the grant 
if more energy does not comply with these conditions  the tax benefits may be canceled  and it may be required to refund the amount of the canceled benefit  with the addition of linkage difference and interest 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combination and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas requires goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment with amortization over its estimated useful life to be discontinued effective january  we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in this connection  we are currently assessing our reporting units 
once the reporting units will be established  we will use the two steps approach to assess its goodwill 
in the first step  we will compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that houses goodwill to the carrying amount of the units assets and liabilities  including its goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount  then the second step of the impairment test is performed  in which the current fair value of the units assets and liabilities will determine the current implied fair value of the units goodwill 
in addition  we will reassess the classifications of our intangible assets  including goodwill  previously recorded in connection with earlier purchase acquisitions  as well as their useful lives 
we expect that the discontinuation of amortization of the remaining goodwill balance of approximately  at december  will reduce operating expenses by approximately  per quarter in  or approximately  for the year ending december  we expect to continue to amortize the remaining unamortized balance of our cellscan technology assets  which was approximately  at december  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for retirement obligations 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this new standard  although we do not expect it to affect our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no  impairment of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this statement provide a single accounting model for impairment of long lived assets 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this new standard  although we do not expect it to affect our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors we have had limited revenues since inception and none from through  and we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability 
we have experienced net losses since our inception in april we  on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries  have had limited revenues since inception and none from through we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we produce and sell our hecps as a stand alone product which  although we can give no assurance  we believe will be sometime in furthermore we are unable to determine when we will generate significant revenues from the sales of our dle m fuel cells or one or more of our other technologies 
we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability  if ever 
our inability to become profitable may force us to curtail or temporarily discontinue our research and development programs and our day to day operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we may never complete the development of commercially viable fuel cells or any of our other technologies into marketable products 
we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete the development of commercially viable fuel cells for any of our target markets 
we must achieve substantial advances in our fuel cell technology  particularly in the areas of energy density  stability of power output  operating time and reduced size and weight  as well as in the temperature conditions under which the fuel cells can operate 
we must also improve the engineering design of our fuel cells and design effective refill cartridges  and integrate each fuel cell into a seamless power source which can power various portable electronic devices  before we are able to produce a commercially viable product 
additionally  we must improve the converter used in our power pack charger to step up voltage 
developing any technology into a marketable product is a risky  time consuming and expensive process 
you may anticipate that we will encounter setbacks  discrepancies requiring time consuming and costly redesigns and changes and that there is the possibility of outright failure 
we may not meet our product development and commercialization milestones 
we have established milestones which we use to assess our progress toward developing commercially viable dle m fuel cells 
these milestones relate to technology and design improvements as well as to dates for achieving development goals 
if our products exhibit technical defects or are unable to meet cost or performance goals  including levels and stability of power output  useful life and reliability  our commercialization schedule could be delayed and third parties who are collaborating with us to develop our fuel cell technology  as well as potential purchasers of our initial commercial products  may decline to purchase such products or may opt to pursue alternative technologies 
to date  we have met the milestones we set for ourselves with respect to developing commercially viable dle m fuel cells  including the level of power density and longevity of use obtained 
we can give no assurance that our commercialization schedule will continue to be met as we further develop our products 
customers will be unlikely to buy our fuel cell products unless we can demonstrate that they can be produced for sale to consumers at affordable prices 
to date  we have focused primarily on research and development of our fuel cell technology 
consequently  we have no experience in manufacturing dle m fuel cells or refill cartridges on a commercial basis 
we plan to manufacture our dle m fuel cells and refill cartridges primarily through joint venture arrangements with third parties 
we can offer no assurance that either we or our joint venture partners will develop efficient  automated  low cost manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the quality  price  engineering  design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our dle m fuel cells and refill cartridges 
even if we or our joint venture partners are successful in developing such manufacturing capability and processes  we do not know whether we or they will be timely in meeting our product commercialization schedule or the production and delivery requirements of potential customers 
a failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the price of dle m fuel cells and refill cartridges is dependent largely on material and other manufacturing costs 
we are unable to offer any assurance that either we or our joint venture partners will be able to reduce costs to a level which will allow production of a competitive product or that any product produced using lower cost materials and manufacturing processes will not suffer from a reduction in performance  reliability and longevity 
furthermore  although we have estimated a pricing structure for both our proposed power pack charger and our refueling cartridges  we can give no assurance that these estimates will be correct in light of any manufacturing process we adopt or distribution channels we use 
a mass market for our dle m fuel cells may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate 
a mass market may never develop for our dle m fuel cells or any of our other technologies  or may develop more slowly than we anticipate 
dle m fuel cells represent an emerging market  and we do not know whether end users will want to use them 
the development of a mass market for our dle m fuel cells may be affected by many factors  some of which are out of our control  including the level to which the technology of our dle m fuel cells has advanced  the emergence of newer  more competitive technologies and products  the future cost of ethanol  or any other hydrogen based fuels powering our fuel cells  regulatory requirements  consumer perceptions of the safety of our products  and consumer reluctance to try a new product 
if a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate  we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred in the development of our products and may never achieve profitability 
we will be unable to market or sell our dle m fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies if we are unsuccessful in entering into alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties 
as we do not have nor do we intend to develop our own marketing or wide scale manufacturing infrastructure  our ability to market  manufacture and sell our dle m fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies is wholly dependent on our entry into strategic alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties possessing such capabilities 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such alliances  joint ventures or agreements 
furthermore  we may enter into agreements the terms of which may not be entirely beneficial to us 
problems or delays in our collaboration efforts with third parties to develop or market our fuel cell technologies could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products 
we have entered into three agreements with third parties whereby each has agreed to assist us in developing or marketing our fuel cell technologies 
we intend to enter into similar agreements with other third parties in the future 
these collaboration agreements contemplate that these third parties will work with our scientists to test various aspects of our dle m fuel cells 
such tests may encounter problems and delays for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  the failure of our technology  the failure of the technology of others  the failure to combine these technologies properly and the failure to maintain and service any test prototypes properly 
many of these potential problems and delays are beyond our control 
in addition  collaborative efforts  by their nature  often create problems due to miscommunications and disparate expectations and priorities among the parties involved and may result in unexpected modifications and delays in developing or marketing our fuel cell technologies 
any such problems or perceived problems with these collaborative efforts could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products and technologies 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not offer sufficient protection  which could hinder our growth and success 
we regard our patents  trade secrets  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights as essential to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we own  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or companies in which we have an interest  patents for certain technologies and are currently applying for additional patents 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in receiving patent and other proprietary protection in all markets we enter  or  if successful  that such protection will be sufficient 
if we successfully develop and market any or all of our technologies  we expect to face efforts by larger companies and other organizations or authorities to undermine our patents by challenging or copying our intellectual property 
moreover  intellectual property rights are not protected in certain parts of the world 
we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any challenges that may arise 
however  any infringement action initiated by us may be very costly and require the diversion of substantial funds from our operations and may require management to expend efforts that might otherwise be devoted to our operations 
claims by third parties that our technology infringes upon their patents may  if successful  prevent us from further developing or selling our technologies 
although we do not believe our business activities infringe upon the rights of others  nor are we aware of any pending or contemplated actions to such effect  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
if we do not obtain additional financing  we may be forced to curtail our research and development efforts 
our ability to sustain our research and development program is dependent upon our ability to secure additional funding 
we believe that our cash resources  including proceeds from our recently completed rights offering  and funds available to borrow under our  revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operating and developmental activities for at least the next months 
after such time  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing in order to be competitive  to accelerate our sales and marketing programs  to establish a stronger financial position and to continue our operations 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to meet our financial obligations  if necessary  or that a third party will be willing to make such funds available 
our failure to raise additional funds could require us to delay our research and product development efforts or cause us to default under the repayment terms of our revolving credit facility  if we were to borrow funds under that facility and we are unable to repay such borrowings 
furthermore  our failure to successfully develop or market our dle m fuel cell technologies may materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our dle m fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies 
if we were to lose members of our senior management and could not find appropriate replacements in a timely manner  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent upon zvi rehavi  gennadi finkelshtain and the other scientists  engineers and technicians that seek out  recognize and develop our technologies  as well as our highly skilled and experienced management 
the loss of the services of messrs 
rehavi and finkelshtain  or any of our other technical talent could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our dle m fuel cells into commercial products or any of our other technologies into commercial products 
we possess key person life insurance of  on mr 
rehavi 
although to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining executive  managerial and technical personnel  we can offer no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel needed for our business 
the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there may be adverse effects on our earnings and our stock price due to the large amount of acquired intangible technology assets and goodwill on our balance sheet 
at december   our balance sheet showed approximately  of acquired intangible technology assets and goodwill  with estimated original useful lives of up to five years 
such assets have been charged ratably to expense through december   based on their useful lives 
commencing january   in accordance with the recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  such goodwill will no longer be charged ratably to expense but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial statements  although we expect that the discontinuation of amortization of the remaining goodwill balance of approximately  at december  will reduce operating expenses by approximately  per quarter in  or approximately  for the year ending december  we expect to continue to amortize the remaining unamortized balance of our cellscan technology assets  which was approximately  at december  risks associated with conducting operations in israel could materially adversely affect our ability to complete the development of our dle m fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies 
our research and development facilities and our pilot hecp manufacturing facility  as well as some of our executive offices and back office functions  are located in the state of israel 
we are  therefore  directly affected by the political  economic and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and the united states or israel and europe  including the united states present military activities in afghanistan and related terrorist action  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of any of our technologies or our ability to supply our technology to development partners or vendors 
furthermore  any interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and any other country in which we have strategic relationships could similarly adversely affect such relationships 
in addition  all male adult permanent residents of israel under the age of  unless exempt  are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
some of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty 
we are unable to assess what impact  if any  these factors may have upon our future operations 
in addition  historically  israel has suffered from high inflation and the devaluation of its currency  the new israeli shekel  or nis  compared to the us dollar 
future inflation or further devaluations of the nis may have a negative impact on our nis based obligations over time upon substantial price increases caused by inflation 
it may be difficult to serve process on or enforce a judgment against our israeli officers and directors  making it difficult to bring a successful lawsuit against us  or our officers and directors  individually or in the aggregate 
service of process upon our directors and officers  many of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
furthermore  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states to the extent our assets are located outside the united states 
this could limit the ability of our stockholders to sue us based upon an alleged breach of duty or other cause of action 
we have been informed by our israeli legal counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act and the securities exchange act of  as amended  in original actions instituted in israel 
however  subject to limitation  israeli courts may enforce united states final executory judgments for liquidated amounts in civil matters  obtained after a trial before a court of competent jurisdiction  according to the rules of private international law currently prevailing in israel  which enforce similar israeli judgments  provided that due service of process has been effected and the defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to defend  the obligation imposed by the judgment is executionable according to the laws relating to the enforceability of judgments in israel and such judgment is not contrary to public policy  security or sovereignty of the state of israel  such judgments were not obtained by fraud and do not conflict with any other valid judgments in the same manner between the same parties  and an action between the same parties in the same matter is not pending in any israeli court at the time the lawsuit is instituted in the foreign court 
foreign judgments enforced by israeli courts generally will be payable in israeli currency  which can then be converted into united states dollars and transferred out of israel 
the judgment debtor may also pay in dollars 
judgment creditors must bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates 
we intend to retain all of our future earnings  if any  for use in our business operations and do not expect to pay dividends to our stockholders 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our board presently intends to retain all earnings  if any  for use in our business operations 
we currently face and will continue to face significant competition 
our dle m fuel cells face and will continue to face significant competition 
a large number of corporations  national laboratories and universities in the united states  canada  europe and japan are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of fuel cells  both for portable electronic devices and other uses 
each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in various markets  which would have a material adverse effect on our position in the industry and our financial results 
we expect competition to intensify greatly as the need for new energy alternatives becomes more apparent and continues to increase 
some of our competitors are well established and have substantially greater managerial  technical  financial  marketing and product development resources 
additionally  companies  both large and small  are entering the markets in which we compete 
there can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not be more successful in the markets in which we compete than we have been  or will be in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such a competitive environment 
we expect to be dependent on third party suppliers for the supply of key materials and components for our products 
if and when either we or our strategic alliance or joint venture partners commence production of our fuel cells  of which there can be no assurance  we expect to rely upon third party suppliers to provide requisite materials and components 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner  or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  or our inability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  could harm our ability to manufacture our dle m fuel cells
