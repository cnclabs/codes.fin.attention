all references to earnings per share included in this discussion are diluted earnings per share 
the company has classified all depreciation expense amounts as a component of cost of goods sold or selling and administrative expenses 
the company had previously classified depreciation and amortization expense separately in its consolidated statement of income 
this change has no impact on net income for the current year or any prior periods 
the disclosures in this form k reflect this reclassification 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sold its hydraulic cylinder division in january the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows separately present the historical results of the hydraulic cylinder division as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on going basis  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  goodwill and long lived assets  warranty obligations  environmental liabilities  and deferred taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on accounts and notes receivable resulting from the inability of its customers and note holders to make required payments 
such allowances are based on an ongoing review of customer and note holder payments against terms and a review of customer and note holder financial statements and financial information 
if the financial condition of customers or the note holders were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves to write down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
certain factors that the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in addition  assumptions are required to estimate future cash flows  including gross margins  sales growth rates and expense levels  the discount rate  and estimated terminal values to determine fair value of the operating entities should an impairment exist 
changes in these and other factors could result in impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets which would require a write down or further write downs to the asset s fair value 
warranty obligations the company offers certain warranties with the sales of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
changes in these factors would require an adjustment to the recorded warranty obligations 
environmental liabilities the company accrues environmental remediation and litigation costs if it is probable a liability has been incurred at the financial statement date and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the reliability and precision of the loss estimates are affected by numerous factors  such as site evaluation and reevaluation of the degree of remediation required  claims by third parties and changes to environmental laws and regulations 
the company adjusts its liabilities as new remediation requirements are defined  as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made and to reflect new and changing facts 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

 business combination 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized
