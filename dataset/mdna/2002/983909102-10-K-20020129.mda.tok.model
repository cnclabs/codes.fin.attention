item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which are subject to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include  without limitation  statements concerning expectations regarding the company s financial position including sales  revenues  gross margins  operating margins and expenses  trends and conditions in the us economy and in the communications technology industry and hospitality markets  and the company s ability to implement its current business plan 
these and other forward looking statements generally identified by such words as expects  plans  believes  anticipates and similar words or expressions are not guarantees of performance but rather reflect management s current expectations  assumptions and beliefs based upon information currently available to management 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
many of these risks and uncertainties are described under the heading outlook and risk factors below 
consequently  all forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed herein and throughout this report 
for the fiscal year ending october   the company reported net income of million on revenues of million 
these results reflect the deteriorating market conditions experienced by the company throughout fiscal although first quarter revenues were higher on a year over year basis  the company reported sequential quarterly revenue declines for the remainder of the year 
these declines were primarily due to overall market conditions as customers deferred spending decisions to conserve capital and evaluate economic developments 
the company responded to these market conditions by intently focusing on its cost structure and by improving its operational efficiencies 
despite the current recession in the us economy as a whole and particularly in the technology sector  management remains fully confident in its overall vision to dramatically expand the company and capitalize on the converging world of voice and data technology 
to this end  the company continued its transformation efforts during fiscal by continuing to integrate its acquired capabilities in lan wan  unified messaging  microsoft exchange and ip technologies  re direct its sales and service employees from slower to faster growing segments of the market ie from traditional voice products to converged application products  and work on the implementation of its new erp system 
near term economic conditions remain too murky to predict  however management is cautiously optimistic regarding fiscal as a whole and therefore  in the fourth quarter  a careful expansion of its sales force was begun 
management believes that the first step toward a future expansion of its business is to prove that it can maintain constant quarter over quarter revenues in the current business climate 
from there  management believes that  with its new cost structure  revenues can be expanded at a faster rate than operating expenses when the overall market conditions improve 
results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million for the previous year  a decline 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected the company s financial results during fiscal as well as management s current expectation for those items for the coming year 
commercial equipment sales 
sales of equipment to commercial customers in fiscal were million representing a decrease from the previous year 
this decrease is the result of overall market conditions that deteriorated throughout the year 
beginning late in the company s first quarter  order rates for new equipment became erratic 
by the end of the company s second quarter  a clear decline in order rates was apparent and visibility into the near term was murky 
that condition has continued to the present  as customers perceive the need to use their available capital cautiously until a clear economic recovery is underway 
management believes that its customers have deferred buying decisions temporarily rather than canceling capital spending 
a significant portion of the company s commercial equipment sales are derived from its business partner relationship with avaya communications  inc avaya 
avaya is pursuing a strategy of moving a greater portion of its revenues through its dealer sales channel 
the company  with its nation wide sales and implementation capabilities  is well positioned to take advantage of this strategy 
as such  the company carefully cultivates relationships with the avaya sales team 
under these arrangements  the company takes title to the equipment and then sells it directly to the end user customer 
the company bears the collection and warranty risks 
management believes that revenues from these partnering activities will continue to represent a significant portion of its business in the future 
lodging systems sales 
sales of communications systems to the lodging industry including other revenues were million for fiscal  representing a decline in revenues of million or 
this decline reflects the recession being experienced in the overall us economy and  more particularly  in the lodging sector 
also  the decline reflects the fact that many hotels upgraded their communications systems during the year yk upgrade cycle and  therefore  do not perceive a need for new systems at this time 
finally  the events of september th had an immediate and negative impact on the lodging industry  but it is still unclear what the long term impact will be 
management believes that it is likely that sales of lodging systems will remain at depressed levels until the economy has sufficiently recovered to spur new construction and major renovation programs 
installation and service revenues 
revenues derived from installation and service activities increased million or to million in fiscal this increase consists of sales of professional services from the company s acquired networking and professional services organizations  partially offset by decreased revenues from installation activities due to lower equipment and systems sales as discussed above 
revenues earned from maintenance contracts were relatively constant 
the addition of data networking and consulting capabilities is a key component in the company s overall vision for expansion 
as voice and data technologies have converged and as more advanced applications of those technologies are being developed  the complexity of communications systems design and implementation has increased significantly 
the company s acquisition of pro networks  inc  a data networking company  and kmi  inc  a professional consulting company  in november of were important pieces of the company s overall strategy and represent the nucleus from which the company is building its expertise in the design and implementation of these new  complex  converged systems 
furthermore  management believes that the quality of the company s implementation and service capabilities will ultimately be the key differentiator that drives customer satisfaction and retention 
management believes that the outlook for this revenue stream in fiscal is dependent upon its ability to increase sales of new systems 
gross margins 
gross margins earned in were compared to in fiscal this decline in gross margins consisted of declines in margins on each of the company s major revenue streams 
in general  these declines can be attributed to the overall decline in higher margin large systems projects in both the commercial and lodging market sectors as economic conditions have resulted in lower capital spending by customers 
the gross margins earned on commercial equipment sales was in fiscal compared to for the prior year 
the target margins for this revenue stream are to 
the gross margins earned on lodging systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal management s target margin for this revenue stream is to 
the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues for fiscal were compared to in the prior year 
the target margin for installation and service revenues is to 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a sudden and significant downturn in its business  which resulted in a dramatic decline in the margins earned on installation and service revenues due to their sensitivity to labor costs 
in response  management implemented a workforce reduction 
a significant portion of this reduction was targeted toward the installation and service workforce to restore the gross margins in this area to the expected targets 
management believes that gross margins earned in fiscal should be within the targeted ranges discussed above and that overall margins  after deducting corporate level costs for purchasing  shipping and warehousing  should be in the range of to 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  excluding amortization expense  were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in the year earlier 
this relatively consistent expense level was maintained through the workforce and other cost reductions in sales expenses and through efficiencies gained through continued integration of general and administrative activities of the acquired companies 
the expense levels for fiscal were in line with management s target of to of total sales 
amortization expense reflects primarily the amortization of goodwill acquired in the four acquisitions done by the company in the past two fiscal years 
the company has adopted financial accounting standard no 
as of november  under this standard  the company will no longer amortize against earnings the goodwill on its balance sheet 
instead  management will  at least annually  compare the net book value of its acquired businesses against the fair value of those businesses and determine whether the value on the company s balance sheet has become impaired 
if such an impairment has occurred  a write down of the impaired asset  most likely goodwill  is required 
in accordance with the implementation guidance in the standard  the company has engaged an independent expert to make the initial evaluation of the fair value of the acquired businesses 
in so doing  the company and the expert agreed that the acquired businesses should be viewed as one business  the commercial business 
the expert found that the fair value of the commercial business exceeded its book value as of october  and  therefore  no impairment charge has been recorded 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on the company s credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by  or  primarily reflecting lower average interest rates experienced during the year 
other income and expense consists primarily of interest income earned from the company s sales type lease receivable portfolio 
interest income declined by  or in fiscal reflecting the maturing of the lease portfolio 
tax expense 
the company has recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
net income as a percent of revenues for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
this decline primarily reflects lower gross margins earned in fiscal as discussed above and also relatively constant amortization expense between the two years 
while management was able to adjust most of its cost structure of the company to reflect the reduced revenues earned  the amortization charge from goodwill is not dependent upon revenues 
year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or over the previous year 
of this increase  approximately million represented revenues earned from acquired companies during the year 
commercial equipment sales 
fiscal represented the first year of the company s planned expansion into the commercial market 
this expansion was largely initiated through two acquisitions of avaya voice product dealers 
sales of products to commercial customers were million in fiscal and represented revenues earned from the acquired operations of us technologies systems  inc usti and advanced communications technology  inc 
act since the date of their acquisition months and months  respectively 
lodging systems sales 
sales of lodging systems declined million or 
this decline consisted of a decrease in sales of call accounting systems of million or and an increase in sales of communications systems pbx s to the lodging market of  or 
sales of call accounting products in fiscal returned to more normal levels after the surge in orders experienced in  as many customers upgraded or replaced their systems in preparation for yk 
in addition  the capital available to the lodging industry for new construction  remodeling  and investments in technology shrunk considerably in  resulting in extended sales cycles and fierce competition 
the company was able to offset some of the impact of these trends through its offering of the avaya guestworks tm pbx system 
the avaya system enabled the company to break into new customer accounts that were not previously receptive to the company s hitachi pbx offering 
installation and service revenues 
installation and service revenues increased million or during fiscal approximately million of this increase was earned from the expansion of the company s service capabilities into the commercial market 
during fiscal  the company hired and trained additional technicians and implemented new provisioning processes and pricing strategies to address the needs of the commercial market 
revenues earned from the company s traditional lodging installation and service activities grew approximately million or 
this growth was fueled by increases in revenues earned from maintenance contracts and billable services on call accounting systems and pbx s  partially offset by decreases in installation revenues 
other revenues 
other revenues consisted of revenues earned from the remaining long distance services contracts still in force and from non recurring  low margin  sale of after market products in which the company acts as a broker to facilitate the transaction for its customers 
the sale of after market products included in this revenue caption involved transactions in which the company procured large quantities of after market components  typically telephone sets  for end user customers 
gross margins 
total gross margins earned in were compared to in this decline was expected as a result of a dramatic and planned change in product mix toward the commercial market for voice and data products 
as the company executed its growth strategy through acquiring companies operating in the commercial market  the percentage of its business earned from higher margin  specialized lodging products and services declined as a portion of total revenues 
the gross margins earned on commercial equipment sales in fiscal were 
the margins earned on these sales were highly impacted by the percentage of these sales generated through the avaya business partner arrangements in which the company partners with avaya to sell and install equipment to avaya s larger customers 
these customers  which are often large  fortune sized companies  have the buying power to drive lower prices and therefore lower margins for the company 
the gross margins earned on lodging systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decline represented a change in product mix in toward sales of more pbx systems and fewer call accounting systems as a portion of total lodging systems sales 
as a proprietary product  the company s call accounting systems earn a higher gross margin than the distributed pbx product line 
the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues in fiscal were compared to in fiscal this decline was somewhat expected as the installation of commercial pbx systems is more complex than in the lodging sector and  as such  the costs to design and implement these systems is higher than the company experienced previously 
furthermore  in the commercial sector  the company has not built up a base of recurring revenues from maintenance contracts  which tends to smooth out the margins earned on this revenue stream 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative sga  and amortization were of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total fiscal revenues 
sga costs represented of revenues in compared to in these levels were satisfactory to management given the rapid growth of the company and the complexity of its operations compared to the previous year 
amortization expense between the two years consisted of different components and was therefore not comparable 
the majority of amortization expense in fiscal related to the amortization of the purchase price of the pbx service contracts purchased from williams communications solutions in late  while the majority of amortization expense recorded in fiscal was related to the acquisitions of usti and act 
interest expense 
interest expense consisted of interest on the company s credit facility that was used to fund the acquisitions of usti and act  interest on a working capital revolver  and various commitment fees paid on the unused portion of the credit facility 
prior to the establishment of this credit facility  the company did not have any outstanding debt 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consisted primarily of interest income earned on xetaplan sales type leases 
under these lease arrangements  the company provides a call accounting system to its lodging customers and service on the system for a period of three to five years in exchange for a monthly or quarterly fee 
under the accounting rules followed by the company  a portion of these payments were imputed as interest income 
in fiscal  interest income also included interest earned on cash investments 
the decline in interest income reflected the decline in available cash balances for investments 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for federal and state income taxes of million or of pre tax income compared to million or of pre tax income in fiscal this rate reflected the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
net income as a percent of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this lower operating margin reflected the company s transition from a niche company in the small hospitality sector to a voice and data integrator in a larger and faster growing commercial voice and data integration market 
liquidity and capital resources at the beginning of fiscal  the company established a new credit facility to provide capital for its planned expansion into the commercial market 
this credit facility was tapped for million in long term debt between november  and november  to fund the acquisition of four companies 
despite the difficult economic conditions experienced during the past year  the company has been able to reduce this debt to million 
as a result of the rapidly and negatively changing market conditions experienced in fiscal  the company s earnings levels  which were the primary basis of support for the credit facility  began to deteriorate dramatically 
in response to these conditions  the company made substantial reductions in its cost structure at the end of its second fiscal quarter and began negotiations with its bank to restructure its credit facility to reflect the company s current earnings levels and to more fully collateralize the facility to the company s assets rather than to cash flows 
on october  the company closed on a restructuring of the credit facility which included the following significant changes the amount available under the revolving line of credit was expanded million to a total of million and it was secured with a borrowing base of receivables and inventory  the outstanding term debt was reduced by million by transferring million to the revolver and the remaining million to a year mortgage collateralized by the company s headquarters building  the remaining term loan of million  after the reductions mentioned above  was put on a new year amortization schedule  and the debt service coverage ratio required under the agreement was temporarily reduced 
as a result of the restructuring  the company s monthly principal payments were reduced nearly in half to  management is pleased with the restructuring and believes that the agreement reflects a strong vote of confidence by the company s banking partners as to the actions that have been taken in response to the downturn in market conditions 
although the company has access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity  the availability of those sources at acceptable prices is currently limited 
management is currently focused on overriding the effects of the current downturn in the economy and returning the company to higher levels of profitability and previous growth rates 
as such  it is carefully managing its balance sheet with a view toward reducing inventories and receivables 
the company has a long standing policy of paying its vendors promptly and has maintained that policy while carefully managing its cash flows 
management believes its most likely source of immediate  additional capital  if needed  will be its banking partners 
while the company believes that its relationship with its banks remains very positive  there can be no assurance given as to the availability of additional debt should the company s earnings deteriorate further 
for the year ending october   the company generated million in cash from operations 
this amount consisted of million earned from earnings and non cash charges and from reductions in accounts receivables offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and reductions in other working capital items of million 
other sources of cash included additional long term borrowings of million and net borrowings on the company s working capital revolver of million 
this cash was used to fund acquisitions totaling million and implementation of the company s new erp system of million

outlook and risk factors the statements in this section entitled outlook and risk factors  as well as other statements throughout this report regarding trends or future performance or events  are based on management s current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
all such statements should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed herein and elsewhere in this report 
us economy 
the company s business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  market conditions for telecommunications and networking equipment and services 
in recent quarters  the company s operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states 
if the economic conditions in the united states do not improve  or continue to deteriorate  the company may continue to experience material adverse impacts on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
credit facility and working capital 
management believes that its relationship with its banking partners is good and that the recently restructured credit facility adequately addresses both principal payment and financial covenant requirements for the present market conditions 
however  there can be no assurance given that the company will have adequate working capital available should market conditions continue to deteriorate 
under the restructured credit facility  the company s access to working capital borrowings is restricted by a borrowing base of accounts receivables and inventory 
as the company s revenues have declined  availability under the facility has been reduced accordingly 
should the company s need for working capital temporarily exceed its borrowing limits  the company might be forced to delay payments to its bank or other vendors 
such delays could materially and negatively impact the company s operating results 
conversely  should the company s revenues expand rapidly in the near future  it is also possible that demand for additional working capital could be in excess of that allowed under the credit facility 
however  in this scenario  management is more confident that it could successfully demonstrate the positive need for additional capital 
dealer agreements 
the company sells communications systems under dealer agreements with avaya  inc formerly lucent technologies and hitachi telecom  usa  inc the company is a major dealer for both manufacturers and considers its relationship with both to be good 
nevertheless  if the company s strategic relationship with avaya  and to a lesser degree with hitachi  were to be terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  the company s operating results would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  in both the separate agreements that the company has with avaya for distribution of products to the commercial and lodging markets and the agreement with hitachi  the company must meet certain volume commitments to earn the pricing structure provided in the dealer agreements 
in addition  the company s relationship with avaya is administered through a joint agreement between the company  avaya  and one of avaya s super distributors  voda one formerly inacom through which the company receives specified pricing from voda one based on certain volume requirements 
should the company fail to meet any of these requirements  future profit margins could suffer 
dependence upon avaya 
the company is one of the largest dealers of avaya products in the us while the company s agreement with avaya is non exclusive and the company can and does represent other manufacturer s products in the marketplace  the company is heavily dependent upon the quality and continued development of technologically advanced products to compete effectively 
avaya is a leading provider of communications systems and software for enterprises  including businesses  government agencies and other organizations 
the company offers avaya s voice  converged voice and data  customer relationship management  messaging  multi service networking and structured cabling products and services 
multi service networking products are those products that support network infrastructures which carry voice  video and data traffic over any of the protocols  or set of procedures  supported by the internet on local area and wide area data networks 
a structured cabling system is a flexible cabling system designed to connect phones  workstations  personal computers  local area networks and other communications devices through a building or across one or more campuses 
avaya is a market leader in messaging  structured cabling systems  enterprise voice communications and call center systems  but is relatively new to the converged voice and data products and multi service networking products markets 
most industry analysts expect the growth rate for traditional voice products to be very low  while higher growth rates are expected for those products focused on networked communications tools such as converged voice and data applications 
avaya is not a leader in multi service networking products or in converged voice and data products 
the company s long term growth strategy is built upon being a nationwide integrator of these converged voice and data applications as well as other high end applications and as such is dependent upon avaya s success in developing these products in a timely manner 
also  avaya  like many major manufacturers  provides various incentive programs to support the advertising and sale of its products 
the company receives substantial rebates through these common incentive programs to offset both costs of goods sold and marketing expenses 
these amounts are material to the company s operating results 
these rebates are based on a combination of the dollar volumes of purchases of certain products  the number of units of certain products purchased  and the year over year growth in purchases of certain products 
historically  the requirements of these incentive programs are changed annually 
while the company does not expect such programs to be altered to the company s detriment  there can be no assurance given that a change in these programs won t negatively impact the company s profit margins and operating results 
dependence upon a few suppliers 
the company s growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on its capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from suppliers 
the company s agreement with avaya specifies the use of a single distributor from which it purchases most avaya products 
while this supplier has performed effectively and has been relatively flexible to date  there is no assurance that the present general economic conditions or other specific conditions unique to the supplier will not cause an interruption in the supply of products in the future 
in addition  avaya has recently outsourced its manufacturing operations to a third party company 
during the initial months of the outsourcing agreement  there have been periodic shortages of equipment 
although the company works closely with its suppliers to avoid these types of shortages  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter these problems in the future 
hiring and retaining key personnel 
the company s ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled and qualified technical and sales personnel is critical to the company s success 
competition for such employees in the rapidly changing telecommunications industry is typically intense  although the current economic conditions have temporarily eased some of this pressure 
as the company has transformed itself into an integrated communications solutions provider  it has invested heavily the in the hiring and training of personnel to sell and service the company s new products and service offerings 
if the company is unable to retain its skilled employees or to hire additional qualified personnel as needed  it could adversely impact the company s ability to implement its business strategies efficiently and effectively 
competition 
the market for the company s products and services is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technologies 
as the industry itself evolves and new technologies and products are introduced into the marketplace  new participants enter the market and existing competitors seek to strengthen their positions and expand their product service offerings 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation  which can lead to the creation of stronger competitors who may be better able to compete as a sole source vendor for customers 
while the company believes that through its expansion and transformation of the last few years  it has positioned itself well to compete effectively in the marketplace  its failure to maintain or enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and results of operations 
lodging industry 
as a result of the overall downturn in the economy in general and the recession in the lodging industry in particular as a result of the september th attacks  there is deepened uncertainty to the near term health of many of the company s customers 
while the company has substantially divested itself from its previous dependence on this sector  it remains an important part of the company s business and the financial failure of one or more of the company s significant lodging customers could have a material  negative impact on the company s financial results 
technology infrastructure and information systems 
management s ability to navigate the current market will depend heavily upon its ability to assemble the necessary information to make informed decisions and implement those decisions quickly and effectively 
the company is currently upgrading its technology infrastructure and its information systems 
this upgrade will result in a consolidation from four critical legacy systems to one 
the success of this conversion is critical to the company ultimately attaining the planned productivity increases and operational efficiencies needed to improve the company s operating results and provides the needed infrastructure for future growth 
stock market volatility 
historically  the company s stock has not been widely followed by investment analysts and has been subject to price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility is sometimes tied to overall market conditions and may or may not reflect the operating performance of the company 
due to the current negative perception of technology related stocks  the company s declining revenues  and the relatively small size of the company s market capitalization  the company has seen the interest from the financial community and average trading volume of its stock decline further during fiscal as a result  there is increased risk that the company s stock could experience even greater volatility from momentum trading by only a few stock market participants 
other risk factors 
in addition to the specific factors discussed above  the following general factors can also impact the company s overall performance and results of operations the continued growth of the ip networking market  uncertainties inherent with rapidly changing technologies and customer demand  the cost and effects of legal claims and proceedings  and relationships with suppliers  vendors and customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
the following table provides information regarding the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the company s debt obligations and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at october  a hypothetical percent change in such interest rates would not have a material effect upon the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
at october   the company had not entered into any interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
subsequent to october   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which was in conjunction with the company s finance facility restructuring
