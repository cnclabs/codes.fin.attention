item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits that receive and process digital video and graphic images 
we also supply reference boards and designs that incorporate our proprietary integrated circuits 
we are focused on developing and marketing image processing solutions 
we are currently targeting the flat panel computer monitor market and other potential mass markets 
we market and sell our products through authorized distributors and directly to customers with the support of regional sales representatives 
average selling prices to distributors are typically less than average selling prices to direct customers 
average selling prices and product margins of our products are typically highest during the initial months following product introduction and decline over time and as volume increases 
we also sell finished systems primarily to the high end video market under the faroudja brand 
these products are generally sold through retail channels 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  other than shipments to distributors 
we comply with the revenue recognition guidance summarized in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
to date we have not experienced any significant product returns 
we also earn revenues from leasing out portions of our premises that are not required for our own operations  and from license fees and royalties 
to date these amounts have not been material 
we have limited ability to reschedule purchase orders to our suppliers and we have to place purchase orders for products before we receive purchase orders from our customers 
this restricts our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products and exposes us to the risk of having either too much or not enough of a particular product 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory held 
for the year ended march   we recorded inventory provisions totaling million million 
we have agreements with suppliers in asia such that we are dependent on the suppliers manufacturing yields 
we earn investment tax credits under the provisions of the income tax act canada because we carry out qualifying research and development activities in canada 
these tax credits are earned at a rate of of those qualifying expenditures 
the tax credits earned may only be applied to reduce income taxes payable in canada 
we currently have losses and deductions available to reduce future years taxable income in both canada and the united states 
most of these losses and deductions can be carried forward for periods in excess of seven years  and in some cases  indefinitely 
details of these losses and deductions can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
as a result of the available tax losses and ongoing tax credits  we anticipate that our average tax rate will be approximately in fiscal on may   we merged with paradise electronics  inc  a private company  and adopted a new fiscal year effective april  the merger with paradise was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of sage  inc in exchange for  of our common shares 
sage  a public company  designed  developed and marketed digital display and video processors 
we also assumed the remaining outstanding stock options of sage  which were converted to options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  consisting of our common stock valued at approximately million  our stock options valued at approximately million  and direct acquisition costs estimated at approximately million 
on march   we acquired substantially all the assets of vm labs  inc  including all patents  trademarks and other intellectual property for cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the aggregate purchase price  including associated costs  was million 
we won a public auction of those assets that culminated in a federal bankruptcy court proceeding held on february  because the date of closing on the purchase of vm labs assets was late in our fiscal year  that acquisition had a negligible impact on our fiscal results of operations 
in connection with that acquisition  we hired former employees of vm labs 
we currently intend to transfer those employees to a newly formed company  nuon semiconductor  inc  to which we would also license certain technologies and patents for development by that company of products for the dvd player market 
in exchange for the license agreement  we expect to receive an equity position in this newly formed company  as well as a call right to purchase a greater equity interest in that company if it is successful 
we currently expect that the newly formed company would raise equity financing from unrelated third parties 
we expect that nuon would also grant a substantial equity interest to its employees 
there can be no assurance that the newly formed company will be successfully organized or financed 
we are accounting for the acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs using the purchase method of accounting 
those acquisitions gave rise to several expenses in fiscal that were not present in prior years  including amortization of acquired intangibles  in process research and development and restructuring expenses 
in addition  costs of million resulting from the acquisition of sage related to the amortization of deferred stock compensation were included in research and development and in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for example  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development related to the sage acquisition 
at the time of the closing of the acquisition  sage was developing new products in multiple product areas that qualified as in process research and development 
a review of the technological feasibility of those products was made for the purposes of determining which products qualified as in process research and development 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to the completion of design verification testing when the design is finalized and ready for pilot manufacturing 
products that will incorporate in process technologies include digital video interface line doublers and other integrated chips 
developing and enhancing these products is time consuming  costly and complex 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications  and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality 
we expect that there will be ongoing amortizations to expense for core technology and deferred stock compensation in future years 
further details on these amounts can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
as described below  significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  and the useful lives of intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  prepaid expenses  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless their lives are determined to be infinite 
the acquisitions that we completed during fiscal have been accounted for in accordance with sfas our acquired intangible assets are comprised of acquired core technology  developed product technology  patents  trademarks and trade names  and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and has not been amortized  but will be periodically tested for impairment 
in arriving at the balances for goodwill arising out of the acquisitions of sage  inc and the assets of vm labs  inc  estimates were made as to the fair values of assets purchased and liabilities assumed  including the lease liability for vacated premises 
subsequent adjustments to those estimates may result in a change in the reported amount of goodwill in the period in which a change in estimate is made 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and warranty claims based on historical experience 
if actual customer returns or warranty claims increase as a result of future product introductions or changes in product quality  we may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for valuation reserves against our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we hold minority equity interests in other companies 
we may record an investment impairment charge if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or our inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may be less than an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record the estimated liability for premises not used in current operations based on the present value of all expected future payments related to the lease 
if additional payments are required under the terms of the lease or our underlying assumptions regarding the appropriate discount rate to use in calculating that present value change  we may be required to increase the amount of the recorded liability 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by each category of cost or expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles in process research and development restructuring merger related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income income before income taxes provision for recovery of income taxes net income total revenues 
total revenues for the year ended march  increased by million to million from total revenues of million in the year ended march   an increase of 
total revenues for the year ended march  increased by million or from total revenues of million for the year ended march  the increase in total revenues over the last two fiscal years is primarily because of increased demand for our products in the flat panel monitor market 
revenues of sage  inc are included in our total revenues from the date of acquisition  february  those revenues amounted to million of the increase in total revenues for the year ended march  revenues from the flat panel monitor market increased to million or of total revenues in the year ended march  from million or of total revenues in the year ended march   and from million  or of total revenues  in the year ended march  this increase was a result of overall growth of that market together with our increased share of that market  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the overall growth of the flat panel monitor market was positively impacted by reductions in retail selling prices of the end products 
this decline was primarily a result of reductions in the cost of lcd panels used in flat panel monitors that resulted from additional manufacturing capacity and improved manufacturing yields for the lcd panels 
in fiscal and  retail prices of flat panel computer monitors continued to decline  increasing overall demand in the flat panel computer monitor market 
revenue from other markets increased to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the year ended march   and compared to million in the year ended march  gross profit represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in the fiscal year and of total revenues in the fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily due to our average selling prices declining faster than our average manufacturing cost 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in the fiscal year was primarily attributable to costs incurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these costs  which totaled million in that year  included costs attributable to the write down of our prior generation products and initial low manufacturing yield associated with the line buffer sections in one of our products 
million of these costs related to the write down of inventory on hand at march  excluding these costs  our gross margin would have been in fiscal we expect that our gross margins in fiscal will decline further  as a result of lower average selling prices and competitive pricing pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with research and development personnel  development tools and prototyping costs 
research and development expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the year ended march  and from million in the year ended march  these expenses represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in fiscal  and of total revenues in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in each year reflects greater personnel costs associated with an expansion in our research and development activities  increased prototype and pre production expenses of new products and an increase in non cash stock based compensation charges arising from the acquisition of sage 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in our research and development activities and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
the decreases in expenses as a percentage of total revenues resulted from the faster rate of growth in total revenues compared to growth in research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel  commissions and related overhead costs for selling  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in the year ended march   million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  these expenses represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in the fiscal year  and of total revenues in the fiscal year 
the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects increased personnel costs related to increased selling  administrative and customer support activities and increased commissions associated with higher sales volumes  as well as an increase in non cash stock based compensation charges arising from the acquisition of sage 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred million in costs of employee terminations and for professional fees and expenses associated with strategic initiatives that we terminated due to economic and market conditions 
excluding those costs  selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal would have been of total revenues 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in absolute dollars due to the addition of administrative  marketing  selling and customer support personnel and because of continued expansion of our international operations 
interest and other income 
interest and other income in the year ended march  was million  compared with million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  the decline in interest income resulted from the decline in prevailing interest rates  offset in part by holding increased cash balances 
future interest income will depend on the amount of funds available to invest and on future interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our tax provision is a combination of taxes on income offset by the substantial research and development tax credits earned in canada and the united states 
future income tax provisions will depend on our effective tax rates and the distribution of taxable income between taxation jurisdictions  the amount of research and development performed in canada  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
quarterly results of operations the following table shows our unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the most recent eight quarters reported 
this unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements that are included in item of this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information for the periods presented

the majority of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors to manufacturers of flat panel computer monitors 
revenues for the quarter ended march  include revenues of sage from the date of acquisition of february  and amounted to million 
gross margins have declined over time as a result of reductions in average selling prices driven by volume increases and competition 
in addition  we incurred costs of million in the march quarter attributable to the write down of our prior generation products and initial low manufacturing yield associated with the line buffer sections in one of our new products 
these costs are included in costs of revenues in the march column above 
research and development expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of non recurring engineering charges related to new product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter due to increases in levels of staff for sales and customer support activities  and variable commissions based on sales levels 
in addition  in the march quarter we incurred costs of million for employee terminations and for professional fees and expenses associated with strategic initiatives that we terminated due to economic and market conditions 
our results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include those described under the caption risk factors  among others 
any one or more of these factors could result in our failure to achieve our expectations as to future operating results 
our expenditures for research and development  selling  general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce our selling prices in response to competitive pressure or other factors or increase spending to pursue new market opportunities or to defend ourselves against lawsuits that may be brought against us 
any decline in average selling prices of a particular product that is not offset by a reduction in product costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins would decrease our overall gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results or business outlook will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price for our common shares 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at march   million at march   and million at march  cash generated from operations was million for the year ended march  and net cash used in operations was million for the year ended march  for the year ended march  cash generated from operations was million 
the increase in cash flow from operations for fiscal compared to the prior year was primarily the result of increased sales volume 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal compared with the prior year was largely the result of increased working capital balances  being principally increases in accounts receivable trade and inventory to support a higher sales level 
in the future we may require a larger inventory of products and increased levels of accounts receivable trade in order to support anticipated growth in our business 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in the year ended march   and net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  the fiscal increase in net cash was primarily provided by the cash and short term investments of million acquired on the purchase of sage less the acquisition of the assets of vm labs for million in cash 
in fiscal and  cash was used for the purchase of capital assets  resulting from the continued expansion of our business through development of new products and investments in leasehold improvements in new facilities in alviso and thornhill 
at march  we have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march   million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  this consisted primarily of amounts received for the purchase of shares under our stock purchase and stock option plans 
as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases and a lease for vacated premises in milpitas  california 
these commitments include leases for three premises in the united states  located in milpitas  sunnyvale and alviso  california  one location in thornhill  ontario  canada and one location in each of china  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
in addition we have obligations under operating leases for equipment 
the aggregate estimated annual payments required under our lease obligations  excluding expected sub lease income  by fiscal year are as follows  in thousands of dollars thereafter our lease agreements expire at various dates through further information on lease obligations and commitments can be found in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
in connection with the acquisition of assets from vm labs  we hired former employees of vm labs 
see discussion in this item under overview 
until a newly formed company hires these employees  we intend to continue to employ those persons 
in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to expend approximately million primarily in connection with these employees 
if a newly formed entity is formed and hires these employees  we expect that the company will repay us for those expenditures  however there can be no assurance that the new company will be implemented or that it will secure financing that would allow it to repay us for those expenditures 
since inception we have satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through the sales of equity securities 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with any cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements on a short term basis 
on a long term basis  we may be required to raise additional capital to fund investments in operating assets such as accounts receivable or inventory to assist in the growth of our business  or for capital assets such as land  buildings or equipment 
because we do not have our own semiconductor manufacturing facility  we may be required to make deposits to secure supply in the event there is a shortage of manufacturing capacity in the future 
although we currently have no plans to raise additional funds for such uses  we could be required or could elect to seek to raise additional capital in the future 
in addition  from time to time we evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in further dilution to our existing shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas replaces apb and prospectively eliminates pooling of interests accounting 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
sfas and are effective for all business combinations initiated after june  companies are required to adopt sfas for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas and on april  and they were effective for our acquisition of sage  inc in february and our acquisition of the assets of vm labs  inc in march sfas will require  upon adoption of sfas  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  we are required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
because sfas and were effective for our acquisitions of sage and vm labs  we do not anticipate any reclassifications  changes to estimated useful lives or residual values of intangible assets as of the date of adoption 
to the extent that an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  we will also be required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to nine months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets and liabilities  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we expect to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and there was no amortization expense related to goodwill for the year ended march  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting them on our financial statements at the date of this report  in particular  whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined what effect the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
also in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not yet determined what effect the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  elsewhere in this report and in the documents that we have incorporated by reference into this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
the factors described below are cautionary statements identifying important matters that you should consider  including risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from our forward looking statements 
factors that may affect future operating results the following factors may have a harmful impact on our business our success will depend on the growth of the flat panel computer monitor market and other electronics markets our ability to generate increased revenues will depend on the growth of the flat panel computer monitor market 
this market is at an early stage of development 
our continued growth will also depend upon emerging markets for consumer electronics markets such as home theater  dvd  flat screen and digital television  and hdtv 
the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development is uncertain and will depend in particular upon a significant reduction in the costs of products in the respective markets  the availability of components required by such products  and the emergence of competing technologies 
for example  the growth of the flat panel monitor market is dependant on the volume and cost of lcd panels 
the manufacturing of lcd panels is a capital intensive process that requires substantial time to expand capacity 
because the cost of lcd panels has a significant impact on the end price of a flat panel monitor  any increase in the cost of lcd panels or reduction in lcd panel manufacturing capacity available for the flat panel monitor market could have material adverse impact on the growth of that market and our business 
for the year ended march   of our revenues were derived from sales to customers in the flat panel computer monitor market 
this and other potential markets may not develop as expected  which would harm our business 
the sales of our products are highly concentrated and our products may not continue to be accepted in the flat panel computer monitor market and other emerging markets our sales are derived from a limited number of products 
sales of our top two products accounted for of our revenues for the year ended march  we expect that a small number of products will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
our success in the flat panel computer monitor market  as well as the markets for home theater  dvd  flat panel and digital television  and hdtv will depend upon the extent to which manufacturers of those products incorporate our integrated circuits into their products 
our ability to sell products into these markets will depend upon demand for the functionality provided by our products 
we typically need to determine the functionality of our products and to complete their design in advance our customers completing the designs of their products 
as a result  we may not be able to react to changes in our customers desired functionality in a timely manner 
the failure of our products to be accepted in the flat panel computer monitor market in particular would harm our business 
we must develop new products and enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change we must develop new products and enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements and industry standards 
we need to design products for customers that continually require higher functionality at lower costs 
this requires us to continue to add features to our products and to include all of these features on a single chip 
the development process for these advances is lengthy and will require us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends 
developing and enhancing these products is time consuming  costly and complex 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications  and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality 
we may be unable to successfully develop new products or product enhancements 
any new products or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements  that failure will harm our business 
we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively we compete with both large companies and start up companies  including macronix international co  ltd  media reality technologies  inc  philips semiconductors  a division of philips electronics nv  pixelworks  inc  silicon image  inc  smartasic inc  st microelectronics  inc  trident microsystems  inc and trumpion microelectronics  inc 
we anticipate that as the markets for our products develop  our current customers may develop their own products and competition from diversified electronic and semiconductor companies will intensify 
some competitors are likely to include companies with greater financial and other resources than us 
increased competition could harm our business  by  for example  increasing pressure on our profit margins or causing us to lose customers 
the processes used to manufacture our semiconductor products are periodically retired as semiconductor manufacturing technologies advance  manufacturers typically retire their older manufacturing processes in favor of newer processes 
when this occurs  the manufacturer generally provides notice to its customers of its intent to discontinue a process  and its customers will either retire the affected part or design a newer version of the part that can be manufactured on the more advanced process 
consequently  our products may become unavailable from their current manufacturers if the processes on which they are produced are discontinued 
our devices are mainly micron technology and these geometries will likely be available for the next two to three years 
we must manage the transition to new parts from existing parts 
we have commitments from our suppliers to provide notice of any discontinuance of their manufacturing processes in order to assist us in managing these types of product transitions 
our semiconductor products are complex and are difficult to manufacture cost effectively the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process 
it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying yield problems can only occur well into the production cycle  when a product exists which can be physically analyzed and tested 
defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments although we test our products  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these could harm our business 
we subcontract our manufacturing  assembly and test operations we do not have our own fabrication facilities  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on others to fabricate  assemble and test all of our products 
virtually all of our products use silicon wafers manufactured either by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or by united microelectronics corporation 
no single product is purchased from more than one supplier 
there are many risks associated with our dependence upon outside manufacturing  including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery schedules of products  potential political or environmental risks in the countries where the manufacturing facilities are located  reduced control over quality assurance  difficulty of management of manufacturing costs and quantities  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  and potential misappropriation of intellectual property 
we depend upon outside manufacturers to fabricate silicon wafers on which our integrated circuits are imprinted 
these wafers must be of acceptable quality and in sufficient quantity and the manufacturers must deliver them to assembly and testing subcontractors on time for packaging into final products 
we have at times experienced delivery delays and long manufacturing lead times 
these manufacturers fabricate  test and assemble products for other companies 
we cannot be sure that our manufacturers will devote adequate resources to the production of our products or deliver sufficient quantities of finished products to us on time or at an acceptable cost 
the lead time necessary to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner is considerable 
we would be unable to readily obtain an alternative source of supply for any of our products if this proves necessary 
any occurrence of these manufacturing difficulties could harm our business 
our third party wafer foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors and significant customers are located in an area susceptible to earthquakes all of our outside foundries and most of our third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in taiwan  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in addition  some of our significant customers are located in taiwan 
damage caused by earthquakes in taiwan may result in shortages of water or electricity or cause transportation difficulties that could limit the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of our subcontractors to provide assembly and test services 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to provide assembly and test services could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would harm our business 
customers located in taiwan were responsible for of our product revenue for the year ended march  if future earthquakes damage our customers facilities or equipment they could reduce their purchases of our products  which would harm our business 
in addition  the operations of suppliers to our outside foundries and our taiwanese customers could be disrupted by future earthquakes  which could in turn harm our business by resulting in shortages in our product supply or reduced purchases of our products 
a large percentage of our revenues come from sales to a small number of large customers the markets for our products are highly concentrated 
our sales are derived from a limited number of customers 
sales to our largest five customers accounted for of our revenues for the year ended march  we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements so that any customer could cease purchasing products at any time without penalty 
the decision by any large customer to decrease or cease using our products could harm our business 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers  and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may not be able to sell 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can then exceed six months 
it can take an additional six months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems that incorporate our products 
however  even when a manufacturer decides to design our products into its systems  the manufacturer may never ship systems incorporating our products 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we experience a delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing efforts and inventory and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
as a result  our business could be harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays its orders or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
our business depends on relationships with industry leaders that are non binding we work closely with industry leaders in the markets we serve to design products with improved performance  cost and functionality 
we typically commit significant research and development resources to such design activities 
we often divert financial and personnel resources from other development projects without entering into agreements obligating these industry leaders to continue the collaborative design project or to purchase the resulting products 
the failure of an industry leader to complete development of a collaborative design project or to purchase the products resulting from such projects would have an immediate and serious impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to establish such relationships in the future would  similarly  harm our business 
a large percentage of our revenues will come from sales outside of the united states  which creates additional business risks a large portion of our revenues will come from sales to customers outside of the united states  particularly to equipment manufacturers located in china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
for the year ended march   sales to regions outside of the united states represented of revenues 
these sales are subject to numerous risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer payment periods  potentially adverse tax consequences  export license requirements  political and economic instability  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
because our sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products denominated in local currencies 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations  which may harm our business 
we depend on product design groups located outside the united states  primarily in canada and in india 
we also rely on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations 
these foreign operations subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism  which may delay the shipment of our products  impair our ability to travel or our ability to communicate with foreign locations 
in addition  the laws of foreign countries in which our products are or may be designed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products 
in the past  significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand have characterized the semiconductor industry 
also  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
these cycles have led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
they have also accelerated the erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property would harm our business 
others may bring infringement claims against us that could be time consuming and expensive to defend in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
this litigation is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry  where a number of companies aggressively use their patent portfolios by bringing numerous infringement claims 
in addition  in recent years  there has been an increase in the filing of so called nuisance suits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights  which pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements to quickly dispose of such suits  regardless of their merits 
we may become a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
for example  we are currently defending claims brought against us by silicon image  inc as described in item of this form k 
any such lawsuit could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell some of our products  which could harm our business 
we have grown rapidly  which strains our management and resources we are experiencing a period of significant growth that will continue to place a great strain on our management and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  and attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners  and other third parties  such as our foundry and test partners 
moreover  we will spend substantial amounts of time and money in connection with our rapid growth and may have unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development and administrative support 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business would be seriously harmed 
we may not be able to attract or retain the key personnel we need to succeed competition for qualified management  engineering and technical employees is intense 
as a result  employees could leave with little or no prior notice 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees 
if we cannot attract and retain key employees  our business would be harmed 
we must complete the integration of prior acquisitions and may make future acquisitions which involve numerous risks our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies or technologies  such as our recent acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs 
because both of these acquisitions were only recently completed  they have not yet been fully integrated into our operations 
the recent acquisitions and potential future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following we may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  we may be unable to retain the key employees of the acquired operations  the acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business  we may not be able to incorporate successfully the acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and we may lack the experience to enter into new markets  products or technologies 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our recent or that potential future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage any our growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to recover the expenditures we have been incurring since march  to fund the operations of a newly formed company we intend to license various technologies to a newly formed third party  principally for use in the dvd player market 
in exchange for the license of technologies  we expect to obtain a minority interest in the newly formed company 
we anticipate that the newly formed company will arrange additional financing from unrelated sources to fund its ongoing operations 
as an interim measure  we plan to advance funds to the newly formed company to cover its operating expenditures pending the completion of its funding  which we expect to be complete by september  we expect to fund expenditures primarily associated with the hiring of former employees of vm labs of approximately million per quarter until the newly formed entity is created and hires those employees 
we anticipate that the new company will reimburse us for those expenditures 
at this time  no agreement has been reached in connection with the formation of that new company 
if the new company is unable to arrange funding in an amount sufficient to repay us for the expenditures we make or have made on its behalf  then we would have to take a charge to income for the unrecoverable amount of those expenditures 
other factors to consider you should also consider the following factors the price of our stock fluctuates substantially and may continue to do so the stock market has experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  and the number of our shares that are available for trading by the public and the trading volume of our shares 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline and the value of your investment would be reduced 
in addition  the stock market experiences volatility often unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we carry out a significant portion of our operations outside the united states  primarily in canada and in india and to a lesser extent china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of the those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we may in the future undertake hedging or other such transactions if we determine that it is necessary to offset exchange rate risks 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at march  a near term appreciation or depreciation would not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
