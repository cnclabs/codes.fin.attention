as of december   the company operated  funeral service locations  cemeteries and crematoria located in countries 
the company also has minority interest investments in funeral and cemetery operations in three countries outside of north america 
as of december   the company s largest markets were north america and france  which  when combined  represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  of consolidated income from operations before non recurring items and of the company s total operating locations 
as of december   the funeral and cemetery operations are organized into a north america division covering the united states and canada  a european division responsible for all operations in europe and an other foreign division relating to operations in the pacific rim and south america 
the majority of the company s operations throughout the world are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that lower their individual overhead costs by sharing common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  limousines  hearses and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest operating expense of the company  are the cost components most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allow the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities 
additionally  the company implemented central processing centers throughout north america to further gain accounting and back office efficiencies 
strategic initiatives historically  the company s growth has been largely attributable to acquiring funeral and cemetery businesses 
this acquisition program created the world s largest network of funeral service locations and cemeteries 
during the mid s  the funeral and cemetery acquisition market became extremely competitive resulting in increased acquisition prices and substantially reduced returns on invested capital 
in early  the company announced plans to significantly reduce the level of its acquisition activity and pursue other means to create growth from its existing operations 
as a result  the company s strategic plan in and was focused on reducing overhead costs  increasing cash flow and reducing debt  while at the same time developing key revenue initiatives designed to drive future organic growth in the company s core funeral and cemetery operations 
the company s objectives in remain consistent with those established in and focus on continued stabilization of the company s capital structure through continued cash flow improvement  asset divestitures and debt reduction 
the company believes its goal of stabilizing its capital structure will be achieved by having a debt to recurring operating free cash flow ratio of or less 
management believes this ratio is consistent with a stable bb credit rating from standard poor s and ba from moody s  with general access to the capital markets 
to achieve these goals  the company will continue to concentrate on cost reduction initiatives and will use its total operating free cash flow and proceeds from assets sales joint ventures to reduce debt 
management s incentive compensation plan is aligned with the execution of these elements of its strategic plan 
the company intends to operate a core business of high quality funeral service locations and cemeteries in north america 
during  the company sold its wholly owned insurance operations in france and in the united states 
during  the company completed joint ventures of its operations in australia  spain and portugal and divested of its operations in the netherlands  norway and belgium 
the company also implemented a plan in to sell over funeral service locations or cemeteries in north america 
in february  the company announced the completion of a joint venture transaction with its united kingdom operations 
the company is currently in discussions with various third parties concerning the sales or joint ventures of its remaining international operations outside of north america 
the timing of the completion of international and certain north america asset sales joint ventures to achieve the company s core north america businesses strategy is not easily predictable 
the company does believe the execution of asset sales joint ventures for certain north america and european businesses is probable in  but believes the completion of the marketing program for the disposition of its south america operations could be of a longer duration 
cost reductions the company s overhead costs include corporate general and administrative expenses  regional field overhead costs and other home office costs related to functions directly supporting field operations 
as a result of the company s continued focus on overhead reduction  total overhead costs for decreased approximately compared to the company s corporate general and administrative expenses decreased approximately in compared to as a result of general cost reductions at the corporate level and the completion of the implementation of its north america proprietary point of sale systems in operating free cash flow recurring operating free cash flow is calculated by adjusting cash flows provided by operating activities to exclude i cash payments associated with the company s restructuring and non recurring charges and ii other cash receipts or payments included in cash flows provided by operating activities which are of a non recurring operational nature  and then subtracting maintenance capital expenditures 
total operating free cash flow is calculated in the same manner as above except the amount includes all non recurring cash payments and receipts and non recurring or growth capital expenditures 
the company s total operating free cash flow does not include proceeds from business sales or joint ventures 
maintenance capital expenditures are considered expenditures reasonably necessary to maintain the company s funeral service locations  cemeteries  crematoria and other facilities in a condition conducive for normal business practices 
non recurring or growth capital expenditures are considered expenditures made for the purpose of generating additional or incremental revenues ie building combination facilities 
improvement goal goal total operating free cash flow    recurring operating free cash flow      included in total operating free cash flow of  for the year ended is  of net non recurring funds comprised of an approximate  income tax refund and the collection of receivables from funeral and cemetery trust funds of approximately  offset by non recurring payments of approximately  related to the company s curtailed pension plans and  of other non recurring cash payments 
the improvement in recurring operating free cash flow in of  is primarily a result of i working capital improvement  ii reductions in capital expenditures  iii decreases in cash interest  iv reductions in net cash taxes  and v the acceleration of customer cash receipts as a result of expanding the company s surety bonding programs for prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the company s surety bonding programs increased recurring operating free cash flow by  in compared to by accelerating customer cash receipts to the company in which a portion would have otherwise been required to be placed into trust funds until the related merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
the company s operating free cash flow goals for relate to the company s businesses it expects to retain in  namely its core north america businesses and its current south america businesses 
these retained businesses are expected to generate recurring operating free cash flow in that is comparable with levels  despite increases in expected cash tax payments of  and the net loss of recurring operating free cash flow from actual and potential sales joint ventures of international operations over and above assumed cash interest savings 
the company s goal is to produce recurring operating free cash flow of  in these recurring operating free cash flow targets assume the company is successful in executing its business plan creating revenue and earnings growth 
these targets also assume the company continues to access the surety market to procure bonds for prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities in those states that allow such bonds 
if such access to the surety markets is curtailed or interrupted  the company might have to reassess its recurring operating free cash flow targets 
see further discussion of the company s use of surety bonds in the financial assurances section included in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in this form k 
debt reduction peak debt at september   debt at december   debt at december   debt at december   targeted debt balance at december   debt at december  included approximately  of currently maturing debt associated with the financial restructuring of the company s french subsidiary  which is expected to be satisfied with non cash french assets in funds available to achieve the company s debt reduction in were primarily generated from i the company s total operating free cash flow  ii proceeds from joint ventures of australia  spain and portugal operations  iii proceeds from the sale of the company s operations in norway  the netherlands and belgium  iv proceeds from the sale of the company s equity interest in a canadian funeral and cemetery company  and v proceeds from sales of certain non strategic funeral and cemetery operations in north america 
future revenue growth the company intends to operate a core business of high quality funeral services locations and cemeteries in north america 
the company and its dignity memorial tm affiliates currently have the largest network of funeral service locations and cemeteries in north america with estimated coverage of approximately of the major population areas 
this network forms the foundation of the company s business strategy to generate revenue growth without the outlay of significant additional capital 
the following details events that can positively affect revenues 
the company refers to these events as revenue drivers to its funeral and cemetery businesses 
revenue drivers funeral funeral services performed 
average revenue per funeral service 
cemetery interments performed 
delivery of cemetery property and merchandise 
development of cemetery inventory 
cash receipts and down payments on preneed cemetery property sales 
the company has several revenue growth initiatives  which are designed to positively affect these revenue drivers and increase revenues 
some of the company s most important revenue growth initiatives are listed and described below 
creation of a seamless  national brand of funeral service locations under the dignity memorial tm brand name 
increase in the population coverage of the dignity memorial tm branded network through third party franchise relationships 
establishment of exclusive  national  branded affinity relationships with employers  social  fraternal and charitable groups or institutions 
implementation of dignity memorial tm funeral and cremation packages 
improvement of standards in customer service 
continued commitment to funeral and cemetery prearrangement 
expansion of cremation marketing  merchandising and services 
modification of sales commission and incentive compensation structures 
focus on sales of deliverable cemetery property and merchandise 
growth capital expenditures 
the development of the dignity memorial tm brand name is a unique opportunity the company believes only it can pursue because of its size and geographic diversity 
this opportunity creates the first national brand in the death care industry in north america that is recognized and portable on a national basis and can potentially affect the company s funeral services performed revenue driver 
a national network with national portability of products and services is important to the company s current and prospective affinity partners 
the dignity memorial tm provider network will also be developed through a franchise program by offering non sci funeral service locations  primarily in markets where the company does not currently have coverage  the opportunity to join the dignity memorial tm provider network and have access to the dignity memorial tm branded products and services  marketing and referral programs  training programs  prearranged funeral funding services and merchandising expertise 
the company is continuing its efforts to execute agreements with affinity partners on national  regional and local levels which provide exclusive  direct access through mail or other agreed upon media to large groups of individuals who meet the company s ideal customer profile 
the company believes the ability to enter into these national relationships due to the expansive network coverage the company enjoys is one of its most compelling competitive advantages in the death care industry 
the company believes this is one of its most powerful revenue initiatives that can positively affect its funeral services performed revenue driver 
this program is focused on local relationships in a community as well as on national relationships ie  veterans of foreign wars 
the company completed the implementation of dignity memorial tm branded funeral and cremation packages in north america in the dignity memorial tm funeral and cremation packages are designed to simplify customer decision making and include new products and services which have traditionally not been available through funeral service locations 
examples of these new products and services include legal services  estate organizing and planning  grief counseling  bereavement discounted airfares and virtual family archiving services on the internet 
these new products and services are designed to increase customer satisfaction while also positively affecting the company s average revenue per funeral service revenue driver 
the company has implemented comprehensive continuous customer surveys in north america to provide valuable feedback from consumers in order to enhance customer service and provide insight into consumer preferences for additional products and services 
the company received responses from of all families serviced in in north america funeral service locations  which is considered to be a very high survey return rate 
the customer surveys give the company a approval rating which is a key indicator of customer satisfaction affecting the company s funeral services and cemetery interments performed revenue drivers 
the company remains committed to prearrangement programs with consumers for funeral and cemetery products and services 
the company believes these programs can increase future market share in its funeral and cemetery markets 
funeral and cemetery prerrangment is one of the most important revenue growth initiatives of the company as this initiative can positively affect several revenue drivers such as funeral services and cemetery interments performed  average revenue per funeral service  delivery of cemetery products and services and cash receipts and down payments on preneed cemetery property sales 
with the reduction of marketing costs  the refinement of the sales commission structure  the shift to insurance funding of prearranged funeral sales creating general agency commissions and cash overrides  the use of direct to consumer prearranged marketing and the use of surety bonding programs  the company has greatly improved the cash flow characteristics and economics of this important revenue growth initiative 
the company also initiated sales of dignity memorial tm packaged funeral and cremation plans in late on a prearranged basis which can positively affect the average revenue per funeral service revenue driver at the time the contract matures and the service is performed 
the company currently has a backlog of prearranged funeral contracts of approximately billion and of preneed cemetery contracts of approximately billion 
these backlogs represent future revenues to the company 
for a complete discussion of these activities  see the prearranged funeral and cemetery activities section included in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
additionally  see the financial assurance section included in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources for a complete discussion on the company s use of surety bonds in its funeral and cemetery prearrangement activities 
the company believes there are significant opportunities to increase market share in the cremation segment of its business through more effective marketing of cremation products and services 
while the company will continue to expand cremation memorialization products and services at its traditional funeral service locations and cemeteries  the company also plans to expand its national cremation service tm operations  the largest single provider of cremation services in north america  from its existing base in fourteen states into five additional states by the end of the company has modified the sales commission and incentive compensation structures to focus on cash collections and receipts 
while this is one of the company s key cash flow initiatives  cash receipts and down payments are also key revenue drivers that can generate revenue recognition for preneed cemetery sales of constructed cemetery property 
the company has also incented its preneed cemetery sales force to focus on sales of deliverable cemetery property and merchandise 
while this can avoid funds being trusted under applicable state laws and is also a key cash flow initiative  revenues are recognized upon evidence of delivery of cemetery property and merchandise 
the company has plans in to invest  to  of free cash flow in growth capital expenditures mainly comprising of the construction of funeral service locations and additional development of cemetery inventory 
the company believes construction of certain funeral service locations  including combination facilities  can meet the company s requirement of a cash return exceeding its weighted average cost of capital 
with a cash receipt or down payment of or more  the development or construction of cemetery property can generate revenue recognition from preneed cemetery property sales 
outlook for the company s objectives in remain consistent with those established in prior years and focus on continued stabilization of the company s capital structure through continued cash flow improvement  asset divestitures and debt reduction 
the company believes its goal of stabilizing its capital structure will be achieved by having a debt to recurring operating free cash flow ratio of or less  which management believes is consistent with a stable bb credit rating from standard poor s and ba from moody s  with general access to the capital markets 
to achieve these goals  the company will continue to use its total operating free cash flow and proceeds from asset sales joint ventures to reduce debt 
the company s targeted debt balance is  or less by the end of as previously disclosed  the company intends to operate a core business of high quality funeral service locations and cemeteries in north america 
the timing of the completion of international and certain north america asset sales joint ventures to achieve the company s core north america business strategy is not easily predictable 
the company does believe execution of asset sales joint ventures for its european businesses is probable in  but believes the completion of the marketing program for the disposition of its south america operations could be of a longer duration 
the company s outlook for for operating free cash flow is made with the assumption the company s financial results will contain only the core north america network and current south america businesses currently owned european businesses are excluded in their entirety for guidance 
the retained businesses of are expected to generate recurring operating free cash flow between  and  in  which is comparable with  generated in  despite increases in expected cash tax payments of  to  and the net loss of recurring operating free cash flow from actual and potential sales joint ventures of international operations over and above assumed cash interest savings 
the company s goal is to produce recurring operating free cash flow of  in the retained businesses discussed above currently have an annual run rate of ebitda excluding gains from dispositions of approximately  consisting of  from the core north america network and  from south america operations 
the company calculates ebitda for each period by adding interest  tax  depreciation and amortization expense to net income before non recurring items 
in  the company will exclude gains from dispositions from ebitda 
the company has several revenue growth initiatives in place designed to organically grow funeral and cemetery revenues as well as ebitda 
these initiatives are designed to affect revenue drivers for both the funeral and cemetery businesses resulting in increases in revenues 
see the future revenue growth section included in strategic initiatives for a detailed discussion of these revenue initiatives designed to positively affect funeral and cemetery revenue drivers 
comparable north america funeral revenues are expected to grow in the low single digit percentage range in based on equivalent funeral services performed and low single digit percentage growth in the average revenue per funeral service 
comparable north america cemetery revenues in are expected to be similar to increases in the sales of deliverable cemetery property and merchandise and the development of cemetery property inventory in will be offset by less revenues in compared to levels from changes in estimates of the company s deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues 
the company has an ongoing review program of its obligations for delivery of cemetery merchandise and services to customers in order to collect funds from applicable cemetery trust funds 
revenue recognition is triggered upon evidence of delivery of such merchandise and services 
comparable north america gross margin percentages are expected to improve for funeral and cemetery operations in as a result of the execution of the company s business plan and the elimination of approximately   after tax of amortization of north america goodwill under new accounting standards 
comparable north america funeral gross margin percentages are expected to be in the range for the full year of and comparable north america cemetery gross margin percentages are expected to be in the range for the full year of the company needs to execute its strategic plan and accomplish several important and challenging tasks to meet its financial goals for some of these are listed below and are not intended to be an all inclusive listing 
the company must complete is assets sales joint ventures programs both internationally and in north america creating cash proceeds for the reduction of debt

successfully execute revenue growth initiatives to create revenue and ebitda growth 
retain key relationships with client families  vendors and regulators to allow the company s operations to operate in the ordinary course of business for the benefit of the company s shareholders 
retain key relationships with surety bonding companies 
the company s recurring operating free cash flow targets assume the company continues to access the surety market to procure bonds for prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities in those states that allow such bonds 
if such access to the surety markets is curtailed or interrupted  the company might have to reassess its future recurring operating free cash flow targets 
critical accounting policies and accounting changes the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition  the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the use of estimates 
revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
the company s trade receivables primarily consist of funeral services already performed 
the company sells price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see note four to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
sales of atneed cemetery interment rights  merchandise and services are recognized when the service is performed or merchandise delivered 
preneed cemetery interment sales of constructed cemetery burial property are not recognized until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
once of the sales price is collected  all of the constructed interment sale revenue is recognized 
revenues related to the preneed sale of unconstructed cemetery burial property will be deferred until such property is constructed and the minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
further  the company defers certain direct obtaining costs selling and commissions incurred to obtain preneed contracts associated with these sales which are expensed when revenue is recognized see notes three and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
costs related to the sales of interment rights are the accumulation of property costs and development costs specifically identified by project 
at the completion of the project  costs are charged to operations as revenue is recognized 
costs related to sales of merchandise and services are based on actual costs incurred 
impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management  among others  include allowance for doubtful accounts the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical collection activity 
these estimates could be impacted by changes in the economy  among other things 
depreciation of long lived assets the company depreciates its long lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
these estimates of the remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions or changes in regulatory requirements 
amortization of deferred funeral obtaining costs the company amortizes its prearranged funeral obtaining costs over years  a period representing the estimated life of the prearranged funeral contracts 
this estimate could be impacted by changes in mortality rates and changes in the demographics of the company s customers 
preneed cemetery obtaining costs are not amortized and are expensed at the time the applicable contract revenues are recognized 
taxes the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires the company to achieve certain future earnings levels 
the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from its current estimates 
preneed cemetery revenues the company recognizes revenues associated with preneed cemetery merchandise and services upon evidence of delivery of such merchandise and services 
the company has an ongoing review program of its obligations for delivery of cemetery merchandise and services 
included in the company s backlog of preneed cemetery contract revenues of approximately billion are estimates made by management related to the status of delivery of cemetery merchandise and services 
any changes in these estimates in future periods and resulting revenue recognition of these obligations will vary and depend upon the outcome of such obligation reviews 
accounting changes in  the company implemented sab no 
which changed the company s accounting policies regarding the manner in which the company records prearranged sales activities 
the implementation of sab no 
had no effect on the consolidated cash flows of the company 
the accounting change  which occurred as a result of the required implementation of sab no 
 has been treated as a change in accounting principle effective as of the beginning of for a more detailed discussion of these changes  see note three to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the cumulative effect of these changes resulted in an after tax charge of  or per diluted share 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivatives instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
in accordance with these pronouncements  the company recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles  net of applicable taxes  of  the charge primarily relates to the recognition of net deferred charges from interest rate gains and losses realized in the termination of swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges 
these charges were previously amortized into interest expense over the terms of the swap agreements  whereas the new standards require recognition as the derivative gains and losses are incurred 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and most of the financial analysis in this section relates to comparable financial information  which the company believes provides a more meaningful discussion of results of operations 
comparable results in all periods represent financial results excluding operations that have been acquired or constructed after january  or operations that have been divested by the company prior to december  as a result  some acquisitions entered into in may not be included for the full year  depending on the timing of the acquisition 
as previously disclosed  the company implemented sab no 
in  which primarily changed the company s accounting policies regarding the manner in which it records preneed cemetery sales activities 
for purposes of the following discussion  financial information is presented on a pro forma basis as if sab no 
had been implemented at the beginning of all comparisons in this results of operations section will be discussed using the pro forma amounts 
the company has excluded the results of its discontinued insurance operations from the following discussions for all years presented 
during  the company completed the sale of its discontinued insurance operations to third parties 
for further discussion see non recurring items and definitions and descriptions of pro forma financial information in this form k 
consolidated results for the year ended december   the company reported total revenues from continuing operations of  representing a decrease compared to total revenues from continuing operations for of  gross profit from continuing operations improved to  and the gross margin percentage increased in to from in the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to operations disposed in  while the improvement in gross profit and margin percentage is the result of the cost reduction initiatives and changes in estimates of previously deferred cemetery revenue during the year

comparable international funeral revenues remained stable in despite a decline in the number of funeral services performed 
increases in monument sales and the average revenue per funeral service in the company s french operations had the effect of offsetting the decline in the number of funeral services performed 
monument sales  which are not a component of the number of funeral services performed  were a significant factor attributing to the stabilized revenues 
additionally  the average revenue per funeral service increased as a result of additional products and services and inflationary adjustments 
this growth was offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation of  resulting from the weakened euro relative to the us dollar during the year 
comparable north america gross profit and margin percentage declined in compared to as the result of increased costs related to training  compensation and facilities 
the company has committed to expanding personnel training programs and improving customer satisfaction  and as a result of this commitment  has experienced increased personnel costs in compared to these training initiatives are targeted at expanding market share and future revenue growth from the company s north america funeral operations 
facility costs increased as a result of higher utility and building maintenance costs 
these increased costs were offset in the fourth quarter of by an approximate  reduction in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts and approximately  recognized in general agency commissions 
the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts is due to ongoing successful cash flow initiatives  which have resulted in improved collection of trade receivables 
the recognition of general agency commissions is the result of commissions paid to the company for insurance funded prearranged funeral contracts in excess of prearranged funeral deferred net obtaining costs 
comparable international gross profit and margin percentage improved in compared to as a result of improved margins in the company s european segment 
the european segment has been positively impacted in from cost rationalization programs

comparable international funeral revenue in compared to pro forma decreased as a result of a decrease in volume as well as a  negative impact of foreign currency translation 
the decline in volume is primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of deaths in the company s european market and from losses in market share in the company s french funeral service locations as a result of increased and new competition from the deregulation of the funeral industry in france 
for further information on the deregulation of the funeral industry in france  see the section regulation in item of this form k

as part of its ongoing cash flow initiatives  the company intends to continue the review of these obligations  however  the impact recognized in is expected to be less than comparable international cemetery revenues increased in compared to as a result of improvements in preneed sales in the company s united kingdom operations and lower cancellations in the company s south america operations in  offset by the negative effect of foreign currency on comparable cemetery results of  in comparable north america cemetery gross profit and margin percentage increased in compared to as a result of recognition of previously deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues discussed above that could be delivered to customers under applicable laws 
this change in estimate increased comparable north america gross profit by  in comparable international cemetery gross profit and margin percentage increased in compared to as a result of improved preneed sales in the company s united kingdom operations and lower cancellations in the company s south america operations 
comparable cemetery revenues in the company s north america cemetery segment decreased in compared to pro forma results due to significant changes to cemetery employee compensation plans  which began to be implemented in late the company changed the cemetery employee compensation plans in to focus on cemetery property sales  which are more difficult to sell and had the effect of adversely impacting cemetery revenues in compared to comparable international cemetery revenues decreased in compared to pro forma as a result of lower revenue from higher cancellations in the company s argentina operations

the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been issued to support the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the underlying obligations these surety bonds assure are appropriately recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues and deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues 
the total surety bonds outstanding at december  was   related to prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery obligations 
in the event all of the high quality surety companies cancelled or did not renew the company s outstanding surety bonds generally renewed on a rolling twelve month basis  the company would be required to obtain replacement assurance or fund an estimate of  as of december   primarily into state mandated trust accounts 
at this time  the company does not believe it will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
the company is occasionally required to post letters of credit  issued by a financial institution  to secure certain insurance programs or other obligations 
letters of credit generally authorize the financial institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure of the company to satisfy an obligation 
the letters of credit are generally posted for year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time as the company has satisfied the commitment secured by the letter of credit 
the company is obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary collects on the letter of credit 
the company believes that it is unlikely it will be required to fund a claim under its outstanding letters of credit 
in  the full amount of the letters of credit were collateralized by interest bearing cash investments included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet

prearranged funeral and cemetery activities the company believes an active funeral and cemetery prearrangement program can increase future market share in the markets in which the company operates  and is one of the company s important revenue growth initiatives in north america 
for purposes of discussion in this section  the use of the term prearranged or prearrangement refers to funeral programs specifically or funeral and cemetery programs generally 
the use of the term preneed refers to cemetery programs specifically 
prearrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral and or cemetery burial to be performed or provided in the future 
revenues associated with prearranged contracts are deferred until such time that the funeral or cemetery services are performed or merchandise is delivered 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property are not recognized until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected and the property has been constructed 
the company incurs sales and marketing costs to procure these prearrangement contracts 
these costs include compensation associated with maintaining a sales force  telemarketing and lead procurement costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs 
those costs incurred that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new prearranged contracts net obtaining costs are deferred principally commissions and related fringe benefits 
the remaining costs are expensed as incurred 
when the company sells a prearranged funeral contract to be funded by life insurance  the company receives a general agency commission from the insurance company  which is also deferred against the net obtaining costs 
to the extent the general agency commission exceeds the net obtaining costs incurred and deferred  the excess is recorded as a reduction to the sales and marketing costs expensed 
additionally  the company may receive cash overrides related to prearranged funeral contracts to be funded by life insurance as a result of marketing agreements entered in connection with the sale of its insurance subsidiaries in these overrides are recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
funeral net obtaining costs are amortized over years  a period representing the estimated life of prearranged funeral contracts 
cemetery net obtaining costs are expensed as the specific revenue is recognized 
for purposes of determining ebitda  funeral net obtaining costs included in the consolidated statement of operations are included in the amortization add back whereas cemetery net obtaining costs are not considered amortization since it is a specifically identifiable expense associated with the revenue recognized 
the table below details the north america results of funeral and cemetery prearranged production for the years ended december  and  including production from previously owned insurance companies and the related sales and marketing costs incurred to procure the prearrangements 
additionally  the table reflects revenues recognized and previously deferred net obtaining costs recognized in the consolidated statements of operations associated with previously prearranged production for the years ended december  and north america funeral cemetery origination prearranged production     selling and marketing costs associated with prearranged production  net     deferred net obtaining costs     costs expensed in current period     maturity previously prearranged production included in current period revenues     amortization recognition of deferred net obtaining costs in current period     prearranged contracts can be funded through several alternatives 
with regards to either prearranged funeral or preneed cemetery contracts  all or a certain portion of the funds collected are generally required to be placed in trust accounts pursuant to applicable law 
in certain situations  the company can post a surety bond as financial assurance pursuant to applicable law in an amount that would otherwise be required to be trusted 
finally  the funds collected from prearranged funeral contracts can be used to pay premiums on life insurance or annuity contracts 
realized investment earnings on funds placed in trust accounts and increasing death benefits associated with life insurance contracts are accumulated and deferred until the maturity of each prearranged contract 
the funds collected on the prearranged contracts that are not required to be placed in trust accounts or where the company has posted a surety bond may be retained by the company  creating a source of working capital cash flow generated from operating activities during the period of time before the prearranged contract matures 
additionally  the company is allowed in certain states to distribute a portion of the realized investment earnings which accumulate in the trust accounts before the prearranged contract matures 
when a prearranged contract matures  the company receives the funds from trust principal and previously undistributed trust income and any remaining receivable due from the customer  or the proceeds from the third party insurance companies original contract amount and increasing death benefits 
the deferred prearranged funeral or cemetery contract revenue is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
for trust or bonded contracts  the revenue recognized is generally greater than the cash received by the company at the time a prearranged contract matures  and creates a negative effect on working capital cash flow generated from operating activities 
the cash flow activity from originating funeral production until the maturity of a prearranged funeral contract is captured in the line item net effect of prearranged funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow is provided by funds collected from the customer which is retained by the company  and distributed trust fund earnings 
this is reduced by the payment of deferred net obtaining costs and the negative effect of contract maturities 
the cash flow activity from originating the preneed cemetery contract until recognition of the deferred revenue is reflected through changes in receivables and changes in other assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
changes in receivables is affected by cash flow provided by funds collected from the customer which is retained by the company and distributed trust earnings  reduced by the negative effect of preneed cemetery contract revenue recognition 
changes in other assets is affected by the cash use associated with the payment of deferred net obtaining costs when the preneed cemetery contracts are originated  offset by the reduction in deferred net obtaining costs associated with recognition of the preneed cemetery revenue 
the company believes its funeral and cemetery prearrangement program will continue to be cash flow positive because of the cash flow initiatives which have been previously discussed 
the following table reflects the total north american backlog of deferred prearranged contract revenues and the prearranged assets associated with the contracts at december  and north america funeral cemetery total deferred prearranged contract revenues       deferred net obtaining costs       prearranged assets trust related assets       third party insurance related assets     the deferred prearranged contract revenue associated with prearranged funeral contracts and preneed cemetery contracts are reflected separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
both funeral and cemetery deferred net obtaining costs net of an estimated allowance for cancellation are included as a component of deferred charges and other assets 
prearranged assets associated with prearranged funeral contracts  which consist of amounts due from trusts  customer receivables or third party insurance receivables net of an estimated allowance for cancellations  are reflected as prearranged funeral contracts separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
prearranged assets associated with preneed cemetery contracts  which consist of amounts due from trusts and customer receivables net of an estimated allowance for cancellation are reflected in current and long term receivables in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company estimates that deferred revenue and deferred net obtaining costs to be recognized in for north america funeral and cemetery operations are  and  for funeral  and  and  for cemetery  respectively 
cremations in the death care industry in recent years  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
the west coast of the united states and the state of florida have the highest concentration of cremation consumers in north america 
while cremations performed by the company in north america typically have higher gross profit margins than traditional funeral services  cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars to the company than traditional funeral services 
in north america during  of all funeral services performed by the company were cremation cases  compared to performed in in recent years the company has continued to expand its cremation memorialization products and services in several north america markets which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation cases compared to historical levels 
the company s cremation memorialization products and services include providing memorial services  several options in memorialization gardens built in certain sections of the company s cemeteries  urns  and niches in mausoleums or columbariums in which to place remains 
the company also continues to expand its nationally branded cremation service company called national cremation service tm ncs 
ncs currently operates in fourteen high cremation states and has plans to continue to expand to nineteen states by the end of the company believes that the ncs consumer would not have chosen the company s traditional funeral service locations as an alternative to ncs  and therefore is considered an incremental customer to the company 
financial assurances in support of the company s operations  the company has entered into arrangements with certain high quality surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on behalf of the company as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been used to support the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities

the company posts the surety bond in lieu of trusting a certain amount of funds received from the customer 
the amount of the bond posted is determined by the total amount of the prearranged contract that would otherwise be required to be trusted  in accordance with applicable state law 
bond premiums are paid annually and are automatically renewable until maturity of the underlying prearranged contracts 
except for cemetery preconstruction bonds which are irrevocable  the surety companies generally have the right to cancel the surety bonds at any time with appropriate notice 
in the event a surety company were to cancel the surety bond  the company would be required to obtain replacement assurance or fund a trust for an amount generally less than the posted bond amount  unless the customer s prearranged contract has been paid in full

these statements are based on assumptions that the company believes are reasonable  however  many important factors could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the forward looking statements made herein and in any other documents or oral presentations made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these factors are discussed below 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by the company  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to the company s business the company s ability to execute its strategic plan depends on many factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s strategic plan is focused on reducing overhead costs  increasing cash flow  asset redeployment  and reducing debt while at the same time developing key revenue initiatives designed to generate future internal growth in its core funeral and cemetery operations without the outlay of significant additional capital 
many of the factors necessary for the company s execution of its strategic plan are beyond the company s control 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to execute any or all of its strategic plan 
failure to execute any or all of the strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects 
the company s indebtedness limits funds available for its operations 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in debt 
the company s indebtedness may limit its ability to obtain additional financing  limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its markets  require the sale of assets which it would otherwise want to retain and require the dedication of more cash flow to service its debt than it desires 
the company s ability to satisfy its indebtedness in a timely manner will be dependent on the successful execution of its long term strategic plan and the resulting improvements in its operating performance 
the company s bank credit agreements and indentures contain covenants that may prevent the company from engaging in certain transactions 
the company s bank credit agreements and indentures contain  among other things  various affirmative and negative covenants that may prevent the company from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to the company 
these covenants limit  among other things  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  and consummate certain liens on assets 
the credit agreements also require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
although the maturity of the company s bank credit agreements and indentures also brings an end to the restrictions created by them  any future credit agreements or indentures may contain terms and conditions that are more or less restrictive than those of the existing bank credit agreements and indentures 
if the company lost the ability to use surety bonding to support its prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities  the company could have to make material cash payments to fund certain trust funds 
the company has entered into arrangements with certain high quality surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on behalf of the company  as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been issued to support the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
in the event the surety companies canceled or did not renew the outstanding surety bonds  the company could have to obtain replacement assurance or fund certain trust funds  which could result in material cash outflows 
furthermore  the company s future cash flows could be materially affected if the company lost access to using surety bonds for financial assurance in its normal course of business 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly competitive 
in north america and most international markets in which the company operates  the funeral and cemetery industry is characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations 
to compete successfully  the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and high professional standards in the industry  as well as offer attractive products and services at competitive prices 
in addition  the company must market itself in such a manner as to distinguish itself from its competitors 
if it is unable to successfully compete  the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects could be materially adversely effected 
the company s affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond the company s control 
in connection with the company s prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise sales  affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds 
the company s earnings and investment gains and losses on these equity securities and mutual funds are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond the company s control 
if the company s earnings from perpetual care trust funds decline  the company would experience a decline in current revenues 
if the company s earnings from other trust funds decline  the company would likely experience a decline in future revenues 
in addition  if the trust funds experienced investment losses  there would likely be insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
the company would have to cover any such shortfall with cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects 
as of december   net unrealized depreciation in the prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds amounted to  and  respectively 
the perpetual care trust funds had net unrealized appreciation of  as of december  see notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the following table summarizes the investment returns on the company s trust funds for the last three years 
prearranged funeral trust funds cemetery merchandise and services trust funds perpetual care trust funds increasing insurance benefits related to prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts may not cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service 
the company sells price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
for prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts  the company receives in cash a general agency commission of approximately of the total sale from the third party insurance company 
additionally  the company accrues an increasing insurance benefit associated with the contract of approximately per year to be received in cash by the company at the time the funeral service is performed 
there is no guarantee that the increasing insurance benefit will cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service  which could materially adversely affect the company s future cash flows  revenues and profit margins

risks related to the death care industry if the number of deaths in the company s markets declines  its cash flows and revenues may decrease 
the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to however  longer lifespans could reduce the number of deaths 
if the number of deaths declines  the number of funeral services and interments performed by the company will decrease and the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects may be materially adversely effected 
the growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america could result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars 
in the death care industry in recent years  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
while cremations performed by the company in north america typically have higher gross profit margins than traditional funeral services  cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars to the company than traditional funeral services 
in north america during  of all funeral services performed by the company were cremation cases compared to performed in in recent years the company has continued to expand its cremation memorialization products and services in several north american markets  which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation cases compared to historical levels 
the company also continues to expand its nationally branded cremation service locations called national cremation service r

the funeral home and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses 
the majority of the company s operations throughout the world are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that lower their individual overhead costs by sharing common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  motor vehicles and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest of the operating expenses for the company  are the costs components most beneficially affected by clustering 
the company must incur many of these costs no matter the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because the company cannot necessarily decrease these costs when it experiences declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flows to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly regulated 
the company s operations are subject to regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trust funds  preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services  and various other aspects of our business 
the impact of such regulations varies depending on the location of the company s funeral and cemetery operations 
violations of applicable laws could result in fines or other sanctions to the company 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs and decrease cash flows 
for example  foreign  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
some states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which the company operates  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes eight and nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
the company generally does not participate in derivative transactions that are leveraged or considered speculative in nature 
at december   of the company s total debt consisted of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
at december   the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
the company s floating rate debt at december   had a weighted average interest rate of  of which approximately was based in foreign markets 
comparatively  the company had approximately of floating rate debt at december   at a weighted average interest rate of  of which was based in foreign markets 
the company does not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income are denominated in foreign currencies at december  at december   approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income were denominated in foreign currencies 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with the company s prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and are presented in notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk in addition to debt instruments  the company was a party to two derivative instruments that were subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate exposures at december  the company performs a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of these risks on earnings 
this analysis determines the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical change 
although the derivative instruments outstanding at december  were sensitive to market rates  they have been excluded from this analysis since they qualify and are designated as effective hedges of net foreign investments 
given this  the changes in the market values of these instruments  caused by market rates  do not affect interest expense 
there were no derivative instruments outstanding at december  therefore  the effect of the sensitivity analysis described below results solely from the company s debt instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of debt instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  the company s pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would be negatively impacted by approximately on december   and  on december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies on interest expense 
at december   the company s debt exposure was primarily associated with the british pound 
at december   in addition to exposure associated with the british pound  the company was also subject to exposure with the canadian dollar and australian dollar 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar would have negatively affected the company s interest expense  on an annual basis  by approximately and  on december   and  respectively
