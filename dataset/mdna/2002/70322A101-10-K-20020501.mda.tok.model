debt service and liquidity 
on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unregistered senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes  which pay cash interest on a semiannual basis 
the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the subsidiary guarantors and contain customary covenants 
the proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding loans under our bank credit facility and to repay in the first quarter of fiscal a portion of our outstanding industrial revenue bonds 
we recently completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all of the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for million aggregate principal amount of our registered senior subordinated notes  due  referred to as the exchange notes 
the exchange notes will be governed by the indenture and supplemental indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes 
the form and terms of the exchange notes are identical in all material respects to the form and terms of the senior subordinated notes  except that the exchange notes have been registered under the securities act  and therefore contain no restrictive legends 
on the plan effective date  we entered into a credit agreement  which included a million term loan consisting of million of term loan a and million of term loan b and a million working capital facility the credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  ranging from libor plus on term loan a and the working capital facility to libor plus on term loan b 
the weighted average interest rate for the term loan was during fiscal we are required to repay a portion of our borrowing under the term loan each year  so as to retire such indebtedness in its entirety by july  under the working capital facility  which expires on july   we can borrow an amount up to million  including a maximum of million in letters of credit 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the senior subordinated notes to prepay all of our outstanding indebtedness under term loan a which  at january   amounted to million  and to prepay million of our indebtedness under term loan b 
as of february  and april   no borrowings have been made under the working capital facility 
letters of credit of million and million were outstanding as of february  and april   respectively 
our liquidity also included cash equivalents of million and million as of february  and april   respectively 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets  other than certain specific assets secured by third party mortgages 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and other terms 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants as of february  and  based on management s operating projections for fiscal  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with such covenants 
we were also in compliance with all provisions of the indentures relating to the terms of the senior subordinated notes and of our mortgage indebtedness 
the following table presents significant contractual obligations as of february  in millions fiscal long term capital operating years debt leases leases total thereafter total  the million in letters of credit outstanding as of february  expire in fiscal in addition  we outsourced a major portion of our distribution  trucking and information system functions through long term agreements as follows o in april  we entered into a new five year outsourcing agreement with international business machines corporation ibm to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services 
under the agreement  ibm provides data center operations  mainframe processing  business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency 
the charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates 
we may terminate the agreement upon days notice with a payment of a specified termination charge 
o we have a year supply agreement with c s  expiring in  pursuant to which c s supplies substantially all of our grocery  frozen and perishable merchandise requirements 
under our arrangement with c s  we negotiate prices  discounts and promotions with vendors 
during fiscal  the products supplied from c s accounted for approximately of all of our supermarket inventory purchases 
this agreement may be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party 
o we also have a ten year agreement  expiring in  with a local trucking company to provide us with trucking services we may terminate the agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including property acquired under capital leases and technology investments  were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  we purchased six former grand union stores and opened five of them as pathmark stores  in addition  we renovated stores and closed two under performing stores 
during fiscal  we opened four new stores  including one replacement store and renovated stores 
in  our capital expenditure plan is to invest million in new stores and major renovations and technology investments 
during fiscal  we expect to open six additional stores  including the sixth former grand union store  and complete store renovations 
we believe that cash flows generated from operations  supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility  our cash equivalents and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements  working capital needs and capital expenditure program for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that we will maintain our ability to borrow under the credit agreement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements 
self insured claims liabilities 
we are self insured for claims relating to customer  associate and vehicle accidents  as well as associate medical and disability benefits  and we maintain third party excess insurance coverage for such claims 
it is our accounting policy to record a self insured liability  as determined actuarially on a consistent basis  based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
all claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
the total self insured liabilities for such claims and benefits approximates million at february  impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
it is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our intangibles and long lived assets for possible impairment based on groups of assets to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows 
we estimated future cash flows based on several economic and business assumptions and have concluded that there is no impairment of such assets at february  however  our estimates project cash flow several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principles board the apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations initiated after june  are now accounted for using the purchase method 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
it addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be adopted effective with our fiscal year our excess reorganization value account will no longer be amortized subsequent to fiscal but rather will be evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have an effect on the impairment of our excess reorganization value account but will eliminate the amortization of excess reorganization value in fiscal  which was million in fiscal in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
such associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be adopted effective with our first quarter of fiscal year we have not determined the impact  if any  that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be adopted effective with our first fiscal quarter of fiscal we have not determined the impact  if any  that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no

 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  which address various aspects of the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
we don t expect that the adoption of the eitf issue no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating rate debt to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
at february   we had fixed rate debt outstanding of million and floating rate debt of million 
such floating rate debt was incurred under our bank credit facility  bearing interest at libor per annum at february  to manage our interest rate risk  in july  we entered into a three year interest rate zero cost collar  consisting of a cap with a strike of and a floor with a strike of  with a major international financial institution  on a notional amount of million of our term loan 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes but rather to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates 
this derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and at inception was designated  and continues to qualify  as a cash flow hedge of our forecasted variable interest rate payments due on the term loan 
we have formally documented our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking any hedge transaction 
we are continuously evaluating the risk to our remaining long term debt and will implement additional interest rate hedging arrangements when deemed appropriate 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates at february  would increase interest expense incurred under the bank credit facility for fiscal by approximately million
