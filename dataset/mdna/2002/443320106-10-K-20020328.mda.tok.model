such statements should be viewed with caution 
actual results or experience could differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
forward looking statements in this report include  but are not limited to  those contained in this outlook  risks and uncertainties section regarding expectations  hopes  beliefs  estimates  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the company assumes no liability to update any such forward looking statements 
in addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this section  such risks and uncertainties include the impact of competitive pressures in the marketplace  including the entry of new  web based competitors and direct marketing efforts by the railroads  the degree and rate of market growth in the intermodal  brokerage and logistics markets served by the company  changes in rail and truck capacity  further consolidation of rail carriers  deterioration in relationships with existing rail carriers  rail service conditions  changes in governmental regulation  adverse weather conditions  fuel shortages  changes in the cost of services from rail  drayage and other vendors and fluctuations in interest rates 
business combinations divestitures management believes that future acquisitions or dispositions made by the company could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  minority interest  net income and the company s debt level 
financial results may be impacted by additional factors as discussed below 
revenue management believes that the performance of the railroads and a more severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence the company s revenue growth rate 
the service disruptions in the intermodal industry due to the split up of conrail  which began on june   appear to have been significantly rectified 
should this trend reverse  the company believes its intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry  causing a similar or more severe service disruption  the company believes its intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be another significant service disruption  the company expects there may be some customers who would switch from using the company s intermodal service to other carriers over the road service 
the company expects these customers may choose to continue to utilize these carriers even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence the company s growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new web based competitors  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
hub distribution s largest customer  for which hub distribution installs point of purchase displays  has notified the company of a significant change in its strategy related to its displays 
this has already resulted in a significant decrease in revenue during the first quarter of should this customer continue with this strategy  management believes the revenue for this customer will continue at significantly lower levels than those experienced in gross margin management expects fluctuations in the gross margin percentage from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in business mix  intermodal margins  highway brokerage margins  logistics business margins  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  competition and accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits it is anticipated that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
should the company eliminate positions due to automation resulting from systems enhancements or centralizing functions  this expense  as a percent of revenue  is likely to be reduced 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  such as the company s expedited services initiative  changes in customer requirements and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative management believes there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of the company s information systems and related platforms  the company believes there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
costs incurred to formulate the company s strategy as well as any costs that would be identified as reengineering or training would be expensed 
management believes the fees for professional services incurred during the first quarter of related to the investigation and restatement related to hub distribution s financial statements will range between  and  on a pre minority interest  pre tax basis 
management believes additional fees will be incurred during the second quarter and management estimates these additional fees will range from  to  on a pre minority interest  pre tax basis 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment management estimates that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will increase in the future 
the most significant factor that will cause an increase in depreciation and amortization expense is increased software amortization related to improvements in the company s information systems 
during  the company placed in service its proprietary operating system  an operational accounting system  and other related applications 
additional factors that could cause an increase in depreciation expense include  but are not limited to  if the company decided to purchase rather than lease a greater proportion of assets or accelerating depreciation due to changes in useful lives of existing assets 
amortization of goodwill with the adoption of statement effective january   as indicated in the recent accounting pronouncements  the company s goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to periodic impairment reviews 
as required  the company will have an independent valuation performed during to determine if a transitional impairment charge is necessary 
impairment of property and equipment on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the realizability of its assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  management estimates that the write down of specific assets could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense management estimates that interest expense will likely decrease from the prior year 
factors that could cause interest to fluctuate higher or lower than forecasted include  but are not limited to  changes in lending rates  unanticipated debt repayments  unanticipated working capital needs  unanticipated software development expenses and unanticipated capital expenditures 
management estimates that interest income will likely remain relatively consistent with the prior year 
factors that could cause a change include  but are not limited to  the possible use of cash to make debt repayments  fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures 
minority interest management estimates that minority interest will likely remain relatively consistent with the prior year  based on the expected profitability of hub distribution 
acquisitions of entities with a minority interest  disposition of hub distribution or fluctuations in profitability of hub distribution could have a material impact on minority interest 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that cash to be provided by operations  cash available under its lines of credit and the company s ability to obtain additional credit will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs 
the company estimates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company has both fixed and variable rate debt as described in note the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement designated as a hedge on a portion of the company s variable rate debt 
the purpose of the swap is to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  a weighted average pay rate of  a weighted average receive rate of and a maturity date of september  this swap agreement involves the exchange of amounts based on the variable interest rate for amounts based on the fixed interest rate over the life of the agreement  without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the debt 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile
