item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview cybersource corporation is a leading developer and provider of risk management and electronic payment solutions for enterprise businesses selling via multiple sales channels 
our solutions manage transaction risk and enable electronic payment processing for web  call center  interactive voice response units and point of sale environments 
we also offer professional services designed to integrate and optimize enterprise wide commerce transaction systems 
businesses engage us to enhance commerce transaction efficiency across multiple business units with varying processing requirements 
we commenced operations in march as a division of beyond 
com 
on december   beyond 
com transferred assets and liabilities related to its commerce transaction processing services division to us 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and through december  had incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we derive our revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees  support service fees  professional services and the sale of enterprise software licenses and related maintenance 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur 
professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
enterprise software license and maintenance revenue is recognized when all elements of a contract have been delivered 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for license or maintenance revenue 
for enterprise software arrangements where maintenance is the only undelivered element  we recognize the entire contract ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
for the years ended december  and  one customer accounted for and of revenues  respectively  and during our business relationship with that customer was terminated 
for the year ended december   beyond 
com  a related party  accounted for of revenue 
the terms of our contract with beyond 
com are consistent with our contracts with other independent parties 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results  including our gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  we do not believe that our historical growth rates achieved prior to fiscal are necessarily indicative of future results 
even if our revenues and number of transactions continued to increase in absolute numbers  our growth rate would decrease 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the acquisition of expressgold 
com  inc expressgold which was completed in january and was accounted for as a pooling of interests as well as the acquisition of paylinx corporation paylinx for the period from september   the date of acquisition  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our professional services revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
estimates are made regarding time to complete the projects and revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy obligations under the contracts  then future professional service margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
restructuring and other non recurring charges during fiscal year  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring plan as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
these restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
in addition  we have estimated facility exit costs for certain under utilized facilities and have made assumptions regarding a sublessee s future rental rate  as well as the amount of time required to identify a sublessee 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application permitted only in specified circumstances 
during fiscal year  we completed an analysis under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  to determine if our goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in september upon our acquisition of paylinx corporation were impaired 
we concluded that certain events and changes in circumstances  including a decrease in our market capitalization during fiscal and a decline in the estimated future growth of the enterprise payment software market  were indicators of impairment of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we recorded a non cash write off of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal year and therefore  do not expect that adoption of the new standard will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate further  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we do not believe our current proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or as a result of the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately million or as compared to million in transaction and support revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately as compared to million in this increase is due to transaction volume increases resulting from new and existing customers as well as the result of a price increase that occurred in early our number of transactions processed was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in professional services revenues decreased to million in  a decrease of approximately as compared to million in  due to a decrease in the number and dollar magnitude of professional services projects during enterprise software license and maintenance revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately as compared to million in software revenues for fiscal included revenues that were generated following our acquisition of paylinx on september   as compared to fiscal  which include a full year of software revenues

the increase in enterprise software cost of revenues is due to the fact that paylinx corporation was acquired in september and  therefore  enterprise software cost of revenues for includes only four months of activity 
the decrease in enterprise software cost of revenues as a percentage of enterprise software revenue is due to economies of scale resulting from our increase in enterprise software revenue in product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in the research  design and development of new services  and to a lesser extent  facility costs and related overhead 
product development expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to higher personnel related costs of approximately million as a result of our acquisition of paylinx in september as well as the addition of other product development personnel throughout we expect product development expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in as a result of the reduction in product development personnel throughout sales and marketing

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
based upon our analysis under sfas  we concluded that the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of paylinx were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a million write off of goodwill and other intangible assets in november see also restructuring and other non recurring charges 
deferred compensation amortization 
during  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million  of which million was recorded in connection with our acquisition of paylinx

restructuring and other non recurring charges 
in november   we completed an analysis under sfas to determine if our goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in september upon our acquisition of paylinx corporation were impaired 
we concluded that certain events and changes in circumstances  including a decrease in our market capitalization during fiscal and a decline in the estimated future growth of the enterprise payment software market  were indicators of impairment of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to these indicators of impairment we performed an analysis of future undiscounted cash flows to determine the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on our analysis  we recorded a million  non cash write off of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
we also recorded restructuring charges in totaling approximately million as a result of our realignment of resources to better manage and control our business

loss on investment in joint venture 
on march   we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc to establish cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
we will maintain a majority controlling interest in cybersource kk  subject to certain veto rights granted to the partners which expire when cybersource kk achieves at least million in quarterly revenue 
the joint venture is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting until the veto rights granted to the partners as described above expire

if we are not able to use them  the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such an ownership change 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets
