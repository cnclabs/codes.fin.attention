the decline in cash flow from auto line operations from to reflected increased losses and lae and the effects of rate decreases taken in book value per share at the end of declined from the end of primarily because of losses from the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff 
see further discussion below under the caption underwriting results homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and all other and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in statutory surplus from to is due primarily to a net statutory loss of million and a million increase in nonadmitted assets  which includes developed software 
this was partially offset by a one time increase of approximately million resulting from the adoption of new codified statutory accounting rules relating mainly to the admissibility of net deferred tax assets 
the decrease from to was primarily due to million in dividends upstreamed to the holding company  an increase in non admitted assets of million  which consisted primarily of developed software  partially offset by million in statutory net income 
underwriting results the tables presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the company s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the two years in the period ended december   and the results of operations by line of business for each of the three years then ended 
the following discussion of underwriting results by line of business should be read in conjunction with the information presented in those tables and elsewhere herein 
personal auto 
automobile insurance is the primary line of business written by the company 
the company was licensed to write automobile insurance in states at the end of  compared to states at the end of vehicles insured outside of california have accounted for less than of the total in each of the three years ended december  the company will explore expansion to new states in vehicles in force were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease in and resulted from actions taken to improve underwriting results discussed further below 
the company s retention rate was approximately for  for and for direct premiums written were million in  million in and million in the increases in and were due to rate increases that more than offset the decline in the number of insured vehicles 
the ability of the company to implement rate changes in california is subject to regulation by the cdoi  which could materially affect the company s future operating results 
net premiums earned were million in  million in and million in the increases in and are greater than the proportional increase in the corresponding direct premiums written because of the decrease in the quota share reinsurance arrangement with aig from in to in and from in to in underwriting results were losses of million in and million in compared to an underwriting profit of million in the company had reduced its california rates by more than from to  and the rate decreases in and had anticipated the continuation of favorable loss trends that failed to materialize 
the resultant underpricing caused the loss and lae ratio to grow from in to for  with the higher than anticipated losses first becoming evident in the third quarter of the loss and lae ratio decreased to in as corrective measures were implemented in late and throughout such measures included increasing california auto rates by in november and in july and oregon auto rates by in november rate increases in of  and were taken in washington  oregon and nevada  respectively  and a further rate increase has been approved for in nevada 
a further rate increase currently is pending approval of the cdoi 
the underwriting expense ratio for the auto line of business was in  in and in the increase in the ratios for and compared to were mainly caused by increases in occupancy costs  data processing and depreciation expense 
homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and all other 
the company has not written any earthquake coverage since and ceased writing new homeowner policies in september but  as discussed below  remains exposed to possible upward development in certain loss estimates relating to the northridge earthquake 
under a january  agreement  the company ceded of its in force homeowner coverages to an unrelated company and will begin non renewing homeowner policies expiring on february   and thereafter 
underwriting results of the homeowners and earthquake lines  which are in runoff  were losses of million in  million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  a provision was recorded for the run off of the homeowner line  primarily due to earthquake claims arising from sb discussed further below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total earthquake losses and expenses charged to income were million in  including million in the fourth quarter  compared to million in and million in california sb  effective from january   to december   allowed the re opening of previously closed earthquake claims arising out of the northridge earthquake 
the company believes this law to be unconstitutional because it impairs contract rights by extending the normal contractual limitations period by more than six years 
the company has pursued its legal rights without success in the california courts and has now submitted a writ to the united states supreme court 
despite the company s challenge to the constitutionality of the law  claim reports have been accepted and losses adjusted and paid under a reservation of rights since the law took effect 
the time period to make claims under sb ended on december  the company is now able to make an estimate of the loss payment and inspection cost portion of the potential liability created by this law 
the company believes it is impracticable to make a reasonable estimate of the defense costs associated with settling these claims 
the company cautions that the recorded estimate for this event is subject to a greater than normal degree of uncertainty for a variety of reasons 
for example  some of the claimants allege facts about earthquake damages that ostensibly occurred on january   but many of the claimants are represented by public adjusters or legal counsel who are acting to prevent or delay access of company personnel to inspect the allegedly damaged property 
thus  in many cases  the best information currently available to the company is several years old 
as new information becomes available in the near term  the company s estimate of its ultimate exposure may change by an amount that could be material 
the company has not written any earthquake coverage since and ceased writing new homeowner policies in september but remains exposed to possible upward development in certain loss estimates relating to the northridge earthquake 
this line also included million associated with workforce reductions and the settlement of litigation matters in the fourth quarter of  and a charge of million to settle certain matters with the cdoi in investment income the company utilizes a conservative investment philosophy 
no equities  derivatives or nontraditional securities are held in the company s investment portfolio  substantially all of which is investment grade 
net investment income was million in compared to million in and million in average invested assets decreased in from the prior year and in compared to an increase of in the decreases in and were primarily due to the sale of investments to cover incurred loss costs  the acquisitions of property and equipment and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the payoff of the million bank loan also contributed to the decrease 
the average annual pre tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in the average annual after tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in net realized gains on the sale of investments were million in compared to net realized losses of million in and million in at december   million of the company s total investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds with the remainder  representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities compared to and  respectively  at december  as of december   the company had a pre tax net unrealized loss on fixed maturity investments of million compared to a net unrealized gain of million in and a net unrealized loss of million in liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the parent company s main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities 
the parent company paid off a million bank loan in and currently has no debt outstanding 
the parent s only equity security currently outstanding is its common stock  which has no mandatory dividend obligations 
the parent s significant operating expenses are all allocated to and paid for by its insurance subsidiaries 
during  the insurance subsidiaries have the capacity to pay dividends to the parent aggregating approximately million under current insurance regulations 
at december   the parent had million of cash and investments on hand and a payable to one of its insurance subsidiaries amounting to approximately million  of which million was repaid in january  and the balance is due on june recent court rulings may subject certain dividends from the insurance subsidiaries to california state income tax 
the company believes the sources of funds referred to above will be adequate to meet its cash needs for dividends to shareholders or other purposes without receiving additional dividends from its insurance subsidiaries until this tax issue is resolved 
if necessary  the company believes it can access the capital markets should the need arise for additional capital to support its growth objectives  although it has no present intentions of doing so 
a possible liquidity risk faced by the parent would be if it were required to contribute additional capital to its insurance subsidiaries under unfavorable conditions in the reinsurance  debt or equity markets  which could drive up the cost of capital and prevent the company from paying dividends to its shareholders 
regulators generally require property and casualty insurance companies to maintain a ratio of net premium written to statutory surplus of no greater than three to one 
growth in net premiums written raises the numerator in this ratio  while statutory operating losses have the effect of depressing the denominator 
the company s ratio stood at at december  the company believes it has taken the proper actions to restore underwriting profitability in its core auto insurance operations and thereby enhance its liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that california regulators will grant the rate increases recently requested by the company 
also  the resolution of northridge earthquake claims pursuant to sb discussed further above under the caption underwriting results homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and all other  also below under the caption critical accounting policies  and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements possibly may require more outlays than the recorded estimates 
as a result of such contingencies  underwriting losses could recur in the future 
further  the company could be required to liquidate investments to pay claims  possibly during unfavorable market conditions  which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments 
each of the foregoing contingencies would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus  which in turn could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
in  the company embarked on a major project to upgrade its technological infrastructure and to conform certain of its operational procedures to best practices 
capital expenditures relating to this project totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the estimated cost to complete this project over the next three years is approximately million 
management believes cash flow from operations as well as expected improvements in operational efficiencies will be more than adequate to fund the project s remaining implementation 
during the second quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized million to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
as a result   common shares were repurchased in the open market and retired through april the company has not identified any other trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that have or are considered to have a reasonable possibility of having a material impact on the company s liquidity 
off balance sheet obligations  letters of credit  guarantees and transactions with related parties 
the company currently has no off balance sheet obligations other than the operating leases for its office facilities  which call for minimum lease payments totaling million as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
the company currently has no unused letters of credit  has issued no guarantees on behalf of others  and has no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
the company has entered into no material transactions with related parties other than the reinsurance transactions with aig subsidiaries that are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following unpaid losses loss adjustment expenses 
the company is required to estimate its liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded on the company s balance sheet at the end of any given period should be adequate to cover all future payments required to be made on account of insured events that occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
however  because the future cannot be predicted with certainty  the actual future payments are usually different from the previously recorded estimates  and sometimes the differences may be material 
these differences are included in the company s results of operations in the future periods in which they become known 
in particular  the company cautions that the earthquake loss and loss adjustment expense reserves resulting from sb cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques for a variety of reasons 
see further discussion above under the caption underwriting results homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and all other and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
property equipment 
the company s assets at december   include approximately million of software development projects in progress see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which comprise the capitalized costs relating to software systems that are not yet ready for their intended use 
upon completion  which is expected to be in  the software will be depreciated by the straight line method over its estimated useful life  which is currently estimated at no less than ten years 
however  the remaining useful life of the software will necessarily depend on facts and circumstances in the future  such as possible future technological innovations or changes in operation strategies 
if at any time the software is determined to have a lesser value than its carrying value  the company would be required to record a write down as a charge to operations 
deferred income taxes 
the company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of the deferred tax asset  which amounted to million at december   that management believes will not be realized 
the company believes that because of its historically strong earnings performance and tax planning strategies available  it is more likely than not that the company will realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been established 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac include premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the company does not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
based on current indications and an assumed loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of  management believes that these costs will be fully recoverable and  accordingly  no reduction in dpac or premium deficiency has been recognized 
forward looking statements the company s management has made in this report  and from time to time may make in its public filings  press releases  and oral presentations and discussions  forward looking statements concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
forward looking statements include  among other things  discussions concerning the company s potential  expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by forward looking statements due to a number of important factors including  but not limited to  those discussed elsewhere in this report and in the company s other public communications  as well as the following a the intensity of competition from other companies in the insurance industry  b the company s experience with respect to persistency  underwriting and claims experience including revived claims under sb  c the company s ability to distribute and administer competitive services in a timely  cost effective manner  d the company s visibility in the marketplace and its financial and claims paying ratings  e regulatory approval for rate increases and product changes  f the effect of changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business  including changes in tax laws affecting insurance products  g market risks related to interest rates  h the company s ability to develop and deploy information technology and management information systems to support strategic goals while continuing to control costs and expenses  i the costs of defending litigation or regulating proceedings and the risk of unanticipated material adverse outcomes in such litigation or proceedings  j changes in accounting and reporting practices  and k the company s access to adequate financing to support its future business 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the company is exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to its financial instruments and the underlying insurance risk related to its core business 
the first column in the following table shows the financial statement carrying value of the company s financial instruments 
the company s investment portfolio is carried at fair value 
the second column shows the effect on the current carrying value and estimated fair value assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market interest rate risk as of december  estimated fair value at adjusted market carrying rates prices amounts in millions value indicated below fixed maturity investments available for sale adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates at december  the company s cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally is more than sufficient to meet its obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year 
as a result  it has been unnecessary for the company to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies 
for all of its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  currently years  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the analysis 
this analysis is further limited as it does not consider any mitigating actions the company could take in response to changes in interest rates
