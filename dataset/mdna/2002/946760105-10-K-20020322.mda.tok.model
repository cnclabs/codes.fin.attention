days sales outstanding remained flat at days for compared to the decrease in accounts payable and accounts receivable is primarily due to the impact of the changes in the reseller agreement with microsoft  as discussed in part  item of this report

page of pages critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software and hardware for microcomputers  servers and networks upon shipment or upon electronic delivery of the product 
the company capitalizes the advertising costs associated with producing its catalogs 
the costs of these catalogs are amortized over the estimated shelf life of the catalogs  generally months 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made
