a significant challenge in marketing clinical management contracts is overcoming the initial reservations that many hospital administrators have with outsourcing key clinical services 
the company believes its expertise in working with hospital administrators  its reputation in the industry and its existing hospital contractual relationships provide it with a significant advantage in marketing new contracts 
the company also believes it has opportunities to cross sell management services of mental health and physical rehabilitation programs to client hospitals by marketing its mental health services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only physical rehabilitation programs  and by marketing its physical rehabilitation services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only mental health programs

revenues contract management services horizon mental health management and specialty rehabilitation management the fees received by the company for its services under management contracts are paid directly by its client hospitals 
generally  contract fees are paid on a monthly basis 
the client hospitals receive reimbursement under either the medicare or medicaid programs or payments from insurers  self funded benefit plans or other third party payors for the mental health and physical rehabilitation services provided to patients of the programs managed by the company 
as a result  the availability and amount of such reimbursement  which are subject to change  impacts the decisions of general acute care hospitals regarding whether to offer mental health and physical rehabilitation services pursuant to management contracts with the company  as well as whether to continue such contracts subject to contract termination provisions and the amount of fees to be paid thereunder 
the primary factors affecting revenues in a period are the number of management contracts with treatment programs in operation in the period and the scope of services covered by each such management contract 
the company provides its management services under contracts with terms generally ranging from three to five years 
each contract is tailored to address the differing needs of each client hospital and its community 
the company and the client hospital determine the programs and services to be offered by the hospital and managed by the company  which may consist of one or more mental health or physical rehabilitation treatment programs offering inpatient  partial hospitalization  outpatient or home health services 
under the contracts  the hospital is the actual provider of the mental health or physical rehabilitation services and utilizes its own facilities including beds for inpatient programs  nursing staff and support services such as billing  dietary and housekeeping in connection with the operation of its programs with the company providing clinical  operating and compliance management staff and expertise 
as the company has expanded the breadth of treatment programs it offers to hospitals  it has increased the number of contracts managing multiple treatment programs under such contracts 
contracts are frequently renewed or amended prior to or at their stated expiration dates 
some contracts are terminated prior to their stated expiration dates pursuant to agreement of the parties or early termination provisions included in the contracts 
as of august   and  the company had successfully retained  and  respectively  of the management contracts in existence at the beginning of such fiscal years 
the company believes the most frequent reason its client hospitals do not renew their contracts with the company is that the hospitals decide to manage such programs themselves 
in addition  a number of contracts have not renewed and programs have closed since passage of the balanced budget act due to a decline in profitability  resulting from unfavorable changes in medicare reimbursement 
under each contract  the company receives a fee for its management services from the client hospital 
management fees may be either a variable fee related in part to patient volume  a fixed monthly fee  reimbursement for specified direct program costs plus a fixed fee or a combination thereof 
the management fee is frequently subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes a relevant price index or other economic factors 
payors  including medicare and medicaid  are striving to manage costs  resulting in declining amounts paid or reimbursed to hospitals for the services provided 
as a result  the company anticipates that the number of patients served by general acute care hospitals on an inpatient basis may decrease and  as an alternative  the number of patients served on a per diem  episodic or capitated basis may increase in the future 
however  additional changes in medicare reimbursement may also unfavorably impact these groups and the company s management contract business as a result 
over the past five years  the company has increased revenues through acquisitions discussed below and through internal growth  by adding services  price escalators and increasing volumes at existing contract locations 
the increases have primarily been due to the increased range of services offered per contract and for the company s mental health segment the increased demand for geropsychiatric services as general hospitals have sought to enter this market 
an additional factor favorably affecting revenues has been the company s policy of establishing a minimum direct margin threshold for its management contracts 
for the company s mental health segment  the mix of programs has changed over the last seven years reflecting the increased interest in geropsychiatric programs by general hospitals 
geropsychiatric programs  as a percentage of the company s total mental health contract programs  have increased from approximately to during that period 
amendments to the medicare regulations in as part of the balanced budget act  established maximum reimbursement amounts on a per case basis for both inpatient mental health and physical rehabilitation services 
in some cases  the reimbursement limitations have resulted in decreased amounts reimbursed to the company s client hospitals and have led to the renegotiation of a lower contract management fee structure for the company 
in other cases the reimbursement limitations have resulted in the termination or non renewal of the management contract  or closure of the program 
the balanced budget act of mandated the elimination of cost based reimbursement of mental health partial hospitalization services 
implementation began august  the resulting reimbursement for partial hospitalization services based on the medicare outpatient prospective payment system utilizes a fixed reimbursement amount per patient day 
the current base reimbursement rate  which was effective april   is a wage adjusted rate of per day 
this change in reimbursement methodology lowered medicare reimbursement levels to many hospitals for partial hospitalization services 
this change adversely affected the ability of the company to maintain and or obtain management contracts for partial hospitalization services and the amount of fees paid to the company under such contracts 
revenues from partial hospitalization services were million or of total contract management revenues for the year ended august   down approximately million  or from the prior fiscal year 
of the company s management contracts at august   or of the contracts include partial hospitalization services 
of the contracts including partial hospitalization services  program locations had partial hospitalization services in operation  program locations were in operation but the partial hospitalization services were not in operation  and program location was not yet in operation for any services in april  cms adopted new rules requiring a cms determination that a facility has provider based status before a provider can bill medicare for the services rendered at the facility 
on august  the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms formerly health care financing administration or hcfa issued final amendments to the provider based regulations  which in addition to requirements applicable to all provider based facilities  provide specific requirements for provider based status of off campus locations and additional specific requirements applicable to off campus locations operational under a management contract 
the company estimates that the revised regulations  while still subject to clarification as to specific applicability  may have an effect on of its management contracts 
in addition  cms delayed from october  to july   the implementation date of the new regulations for facilities and organizations treated as provider based prior to october  the company believes that the final amendments will not have a significant impact on its current operations of inpatient psychiatric units located within general hospitals 
in february  it was announced by cms that inpatient rehabilitation units do not have to meet provider based status to bill medicare for services rendered to patients 
this announcement was supported by the august  federal register 
the balanced budget refinement act of mandates that a prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric services be developed 
the system shall include an adequate patient classification system that reflects the differences in patient resource use and costs  ie acuity 
in addition  the law states that the payment system must be budget neutral and be a per diem system  however a per case rate system alternative is being considered 
the law outlined that the secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of congress a report that includes a description of the system no later than october   and that the system must be implemented by october  not withstanding these deadlines  both dates have passed and no description of the system has been presented as yet 
in early  tom scully  administrator for cms  gave a speech in which he predicted that a proposed prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric services would be released in march  subjected to a comment period  and then implemented in january a prospective payment system with reimbursement based on a patient classification system may raise or lower medicare reimbursement levels to hospitals for inpatient psychiatric services 
to the extent client hospital reimbursement decreases  this could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain and obtain management contracts for inpatient psychiatric services and the amount of fees paid to the company under such contracts 
recent amendments to the medicare statutes also provide for a phase out of cost based reimbursement of physical rehabilitation services over a two year period  which began january  depending on a hospital s medicare fiscal year  the phase out period could be from to months 
the phase in of a prospective payment system with reimbursement based on a functional patient classification may raise or lower medicare per patient and or overall reimbursement levels to hospitals for physical rehabilitation services  subject to the subsequent relative changes in per patient costs and patient volumes 
where lower  this could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain and or obtain management contracts for physical rehabilitation services and the amount of fees paid to the company under such contracts 
the company believes its hospital based service delivery system is a cost efficient model in general terms as compared to alternative structures in the marketplace 
while the company is generally not experiencing adverse consequences as a result of this change in reimbursement  at this time  the company cannot meaningfully predict the ultimate impact prospective payment will have on the programs it currently manages or on its opportunities for obtaining new programs

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis  with the exception of the company s adoption of fas and fas effective september  the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates its accounting policies and the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  the estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
in the company s opinion  the significant accounting policies most important to aid in understanding its financial results are the following allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances are based on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivable considering such factors as past experience and taking into account current collection trends that are expected to continue 
factors taken into consideration in estimating the reserve are amounts past due  in dispute  or a client which the company believes might be having financial difficulties 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company increases the allowances for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
at august  and  respectively  other identifiable intangible assets  net  consist of contracts approximately  and  non competes approximately  and and trade name approximately  and 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations sfas and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination  whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets  and the accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangibles subsequent to their acquisitions 
these standards require all future business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and goodwill not to be amortized  but instead to be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the company elected to adopt sfas and sfas on a prospective basis as of september  as a result of implementing these new standards  the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill as of august accounting for these types of assets require significant estimates and judgement  especially as to a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
for each acquisition  a valuation was completed to determine a reasonable purchase price allocation 
upon completion of the allocation process an amount was assigned to various identified assets including intangible assets and the remainder was assigned to goodwill 
the purchase price allocation process requires estimates and judgements as to expectations for the various businesses and business strategies 
for example  certain growth rates were assumed for each business 
additionally  different operating margins for each type of service offering were included in the estimates 
if actual growth rates or operating margins  among other assumptions  differ significantly from the estimate and judgements used in the purchase price allocation  a possible impairment of the intangible assets and or goodwill or an acceleration in amortization expense may result 
in addition  sfas generally requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
however  intangible assets with indefinite lives are to be tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
because of the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to the company s consolidated balance sheet  annual or interim impairment analyses are important 
changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
contracts represent the fair value of management contracts and service contracts purchased and are being amortized using the straight line method over seven years 
other intangibles primarily includes the fair value of trade names and non compete agreements  which are being amortized over their expected useful lives 
medical claims medical claims payable represent the liability for healthcare claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr related to the company s managed healthcare business 
the ibnr portion of medical claims payable is estimated based upon authorized healthcare services  past claims payment experience for member groups  enrollment data  utilization statistics and other factors 
although variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes the recorded liability for medical claims payable is adequate 
medical claim payable balances are continually monitored and reviewed 
changes in assumptions for care costs caused by changes in actual or expected experience could cause these estimates to change significantly 
reserves for employee health benefits the company retains a significant amount of self insurance risk for its employee health benefits 
the company maintains stop loss insurance such that the company s liability for health insurance is subject to certain individual and aggregate limits 
each month end the company records an accrued expense for estimated health benefit claims incurred but unpaid or not reported at the end of such period 
the company estimates this accrual based on a number of factors including historical experience  industry trends and recent claims history 
this accrual estimate is subject to ongoing revision as conditions might change and as new data may be presented 
adjustments to estimated liabilities are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs

client hospitals receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid programs or payments from insurers  self funded benefit plans or other third party payors for the mental health and physical rehabilitation services provided to the patients of the programs managed by the company 
as a result  the availability and amount of such reimbursements  which are subject to change  may impact the decision of general acute care hospitals regarding whether to offer mental health and physical rehabilitation services pursuant to management contract with the company  as well as whether to continue such contracts subject to contract termination provisions and the amount of fees to be paid thereunder
