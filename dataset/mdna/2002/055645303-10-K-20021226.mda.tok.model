liquidity and capital resources we are engaged in the business of originating and holding for investment senior and junior real estate mortgages secured by income producing property 
our investment policy emphasizes short term mortgage loans 
we also purchase senior and junior participations in short term mortgage loans and originate participating mortgage loans and loans to joint ventures in which we are an equity participant 
repayments of real estate loans in the amount of  are due during the twelve months ending september   including  due on demand which was paid in full subsequent to september  
the availability of mortgage financing secured by real property and the market for selling real estate is cyclical 
since these are the principal sources for the generation of funds by our borrowers to repay our outstanding real estate loans  we cannot project the portion of loans maturing during the next twelve months which will be paid or the portion of loans which will be extended for a fixed term or on a month to month basis 
we maintain a  revolving credit facility with north fork bank 
the facility provides for borrowings up to  but no greater than of qualified first mortgage loans pledged to north fork bank  provided that no more than of the pledged loans may relate to properties situated outside of the new york metropolitan area as defined in the credit agreement 
we had  of unused availability under this line at september  as of december  there is no outstanding amount due under the north fork bank credit line and approximately  is available to us under this credit line 
we also have the ability to borrow on margin  using the shares we own in entertainment properties trust as collateral 
at september  there was  outstanding of the approximately  available under this facility 
we paid down this margin facility subsequent to september  and approximately  is available at december  during the twelve months ended september   we generated cash of  from operating activities   from the sale of real estate properties and real estate loans   from collections from real estate loans and  from a net increase in borrowed funds 
these funds  in addition to cash on hand  were used primarily to fund real estate loans of  to make joint venture investments in the aggregate amount of  and to pay cash distributions to shareholders in the amount of we will satisfy our liquidity needs in the year ending september  from cash and cash investments on hand  the credit facility with north fork bank  the availability in our margin account collateralized by the epr shares  interest and principal payments received on outstanding real estate loans and net cash flow generated from the operation and sale of real estate assets 
outlook the real estate business in general is cyclical and to a large extent depends upon  among other factors  national and local business and economic conditions  government economic policies and the level of interest rates 
most economists indicate that the national economy has been in a recessionary mode for a period of time 
notwithstanding the difficult national and local economies for the past two years  we have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business 
however  a difficult or declining real estate market in the new york metropolitan area or in other parts of the country and a recessionary economy could potentially have the following adverse effects on our business i an increase in loan defaults which will result in decreased interest and fees on real estate loans  an increase in loan loss reserves and an increase in expenses incurred in foreclosures and restructurings  ii a decrease in loan originations  and iii a decrease in rental income from properties owned by us or joint ventures in which we are a venture participant and an increase in operating expenses related to real estate properties 
however  a declining real estate market could also provide us with opportunities since  in a declining market  other lenders  particularly institutional lenders  become more conservative in their lending activities 
if such a lending environment should occur  the amount of potential business for us could increase 
we are aware of the difficulties which could be encountered in a declining real estate environment 
we therefore monitor our mortgage portfolio for compliance by our borrowers 
we also believe that our loan underwriting policies should minimize the negative long term effects of a declining real estate environment 
since approximately of our loan portfolio provides for stated minimum or fixed interest rates  the current low interest rate environment  although negatively affecting our revenues and net income  has not had and should not have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code since our organization 
to qualify as a real estate investment trust  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently to our shareholders at least of our adjusted taxable income 
it is the current intention of our management to comply with these requirements and maintain our real estate investment trust status 
as a real estate investment trust  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a real estate investment trust for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a real estate investment trust  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
as a result of accumulated tax losses in prior years  we were not required to make cash distributions to shareholders to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes until the accumulated tax losses were fully used 
the accumulated tax losses were fully used during the calendar year and we resumed the payment of cash distributions to our shareholders in july  for tax purposes  we report on a calendar year basis as distinguished from financial reporting purposes for which we are on a september th fiscal year 
we distributed of our taxable income for calendar by october  we estimate taxable income for will be  of which approximately  is expected to represent capital gain income 
to comply with the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue service and the applicable regulations thereunder at least of the taxable income is required to be distributed by october  it is our intention to pay to our shareholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of available for sale securities 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments and estimates by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include allowance for possible losses we review our mortgage portfolio and real estate assets on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of the real estate assets underlying our loans or any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is a need for a provision for an allowance for possible losses against our real estate loans or an impairment allowance against our real estate assets 
in reviewing the value of the collateral underlying our loan portfolio and our real estate assets  we seek to arrive at the fair market value of the underlying collateral or the real estate by taking into account numerous factors including market evaluations of the underlying collateral or the real estate  operating cash flow from the property during a projected holding period and estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
each of these factors entails significant judgments and estimates 
real estate assets held for use are evaluated for indicators of impairment using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
if that analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment  an impairment provision will be determined based upon the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its fair value 
real estate assets which are held for sale are valued at the lower of the recorded cost or estimated fair value  less the cost to sell 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals of either the real property underlying our loans or the real estate assets which we hold  but we rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any valuation allowances taken with respect to our loan portfolio or our real estate assets will reduce our net income  assets and shareholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
no valuation allowance was recorded against our mortgage portfolio in there was no valuation adjustment recorded in against our real estate assets 
revenue recognition we recognize interest income and rental income on an accrual basis  unless we make a judgment that impairment of a loan or loans or of real estate owned renders doubtful collection of interest or rent in accordance with the applicable loan documents or leases 
in making a judgment as to the collectibility of interest or rent we consider  among other factors  the status of the loan or property  the borrower s or tenant s financial condition  payment history and anticipated events in the future 
accordingly in looking at various factors we must make a significant judgment as to whether to treat a loan or real estate owned as impaired 
if we make a decision to treat a problem loan or real estate asset as unimpaired and therefore continue to recognize the interest and rent as income on an accrual basis  we could overstate income by recognizing income that will not be collected and the uncollectible amount will ultimately have to be written off 
the period in which the uncollectible amount is written off could adversely affect taxable income for a specific year and our ability to pay cash distributions

the computation of the fee includes non accruing mortgage receivables to the extent they exceed allowances for loan losses 
the fee under the advisory agreement is computed and payable quarterly  subject to adjustment at year end based on the audited financial statements 
during fiscal reit earned  under the advisory agreement 
borrowers pay fees directly to reit for services rendered in arranging loans made by us 
these fees amounted to  for year ending september  item a market risk disclosure our primary component of market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and to a lesser extent our interest expense are subject to changes in interest rates 
we seek to minimize these risks by originating loans that are indexed to the prime rate  with a stated minimum interest rate  and borrowing  when necessary  from our available credit line which is also indexed to the prime rate 
at september  approximately of our portfolio was variable rate based primarily on the prime rate 
any changes in the prime interest rate could have a positive or negative effect on our net interest income 
when determining interest rate sensitivity we assume that any change in interest rates is immediate and that the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remain constant over the period being measured 
we assessed the market risk for our variable rate mortgage receivables and variable rate debt and believe that a one percent increase in interest rates would have approximately a  positive effect on income before taxes and a one percent decline in interest rates would have approximately a  negative effect on income before taxes 
in addition  we originate loans with short maturities and maintain a strong capital position 
at september  our loan portfolio was primarily secured by properties located in the new york metropolitan area  new jersey and connecticut  in california  in colorado and in maryland and it is therefore subject to risks associated with the economies of these localities
