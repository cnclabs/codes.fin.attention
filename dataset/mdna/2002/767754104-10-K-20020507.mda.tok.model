item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management believes that the following matters should be considered in connection with the discussion of results of operations and financial condition recent actions affecting operating results 
during fiscal and  we took a number of actions which had the short term effect of significantly reducing our operating results but which management believes were nevertheless necessary 
in fiscal  the actions taken were i completion of the refinancing  which extended the maturity of the majority of our debt  converted a portion of our debt to equity  and reclassified capital leases to operating leases  resulting in a aggregate loss of million and ii our decision to close or relocate certain stores  which resulted in a million charge which is included in the million charge for store closing and impairment 
among the actions taken in fiscal were i the sale of pcs which resulted in our recognizing a loss of million and an increase in income tax expense of million  ii the exchange of approximately million of our debt for shares of our common stock which resulted in a net loss of million  iii our decision to close or relocate certain stores that resulted in a million charge which is included in the million charge for store closing and impairment  and iv the restatement and audit of our fiscal and financial statements and the related investigation conducted by our audit committee of prior accounting irregularities resulted in our incurring and recording of million of accounting and legal expense 
we anticipate taking similar actions in the future that may have a material negative impact upon our operating results for the period in which we take those actions or subsequent periods 
maturing store base 
since the beginning of fiscal  we built new stores  relocated stores  remodeled stores and closed  stores 
these new  relocated and remodeled stores represented approximately of our total stores at march  and are generally larger  free standing stores and have higher operating expenses than our older stores 
new stores generally do not become profitable until a critical mass of customers is developed 
relocated stores also must attract additional customers to achieve comparable profitability to the store that was replaced 
we believe that the period of time required for a new store to achieve profitable operations is generally between three to five years 
this period can vary significantly based on the location of a particular store and on other factors  including the investments made in purchasing prescription files for the location and advertising 
our recent liquidity constraints have limited our ability to purchase prescription files and make other investments to promote the development of our new and relocated stores 
we believe that our relatively high percentage of new and relocated stores is a significant factor in our recent operating results 
management believes that as these newer stores mature they should gain the critical mass of customers needed for profitable operations 
we believe this continuing maturation should positively affect our operating performance in future periods 
if we are not able to improve the performance of these new and relocated stores  it will have a material adverse effect on our ability to restore the profitability of our operations 
substantial investigation expenses 
we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the process of reviewing and reconciling our books and records  restating our and financial statements  investigating our prior accounting practices  preparing our financial statements and defending our company in pending investigations 
included in these expenses in fiscal are the costs of the deloitte touche llp audits  the investigation by the law firm of swidler  berlin  shereff  friedman  assisted by deloitte touche llp  conducted for our audit committee concerning the accounting irregularities which led to the restatement of our financial statements for our and fiscal years and the costs of retaining andersen llp to assist management in reviewing and reconciling our books and records 
we incurred million in fiscal  million in fiscal and we expect to incur million to million in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with the ongoing litigation and investigations to which we are subject 
dilutive equity issuances 
at march   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes  preferred stock and warrants 
during fiscal  we issued million shares of common stock in exchange for million of indebtedness 
we also issued million shares of common stock for million 
see liquidity and capital resources refinancing for further details 
at march   our million shares of common stock potentially issuable consist of the following outstanding convertible preferred warrants and strike price stock options a notes b stock other total shares in thousands and under    to    and over     total issuable shares      a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million b the conversion of these notes to equity would reduce the principal amount of debt by million sale of pcs 
on october   we sold pcs  our pbm segment  to advance paradigm now advancepcs 
the selling price of pcs consisted of million in cash  million in principal amount of advancepcs s promissory notes and advancepcs equity securities 
accordingly  the pbm segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  and the operating income of the pbm segment through october   the date of sale  is reflected separately from the income from continuing operations 
the loss on disposal of the pbm segment was million 
additionally  we recorded an increase to the tax valuation allowance and income tax expense of million in the first quarter of fiscal in continuing operations 
in march  the company sold its investment in advancepcs equity securities for million  resulting in a gain of million 
additionally  advancepcs repurchased the promissory notes for million  plus accrued interest 
working capital 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and borrowings 
we expect to use borrowings to finance inventories and to support our continued growth 
over of our front end sales are in cash 
third party payors  which typically settle in fewer than days  accounted for of our pharmacy sales and of our revenues in fiscal seasonality 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations in the first and fourth quarters as the result of the concentration of holidays and the flu season 
we tailor certain front end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons 
industry trends 
it is anticipated that pharmacy sales in the united states will increase over the next five years 
this anticipated growth is expected to be driven by the baby boom generation entering their fifties  the increasing life expectancy of the american population  the introduction of several new drugs and inflation 
the retail drugstore industry is highly fragmented and has been experiencing consolidation 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
we expect to continue to compete on the basis of price and convenience  particularly in front end products  and therefore will continue to focus on programs designed to improve our image with customers 
prescription drug sales continue to represent a great portion of our new business due to the general aging of the population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
in fiscal  we were reimbursed by third party payors for approximately of all of the prescription drugs that we sold 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales would be reduced and the profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
results of operations revenue and other operating data year ended march  march  february  weeks weeks weeks dollars in thousands revenue    revenue growth same store sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy as a of total sales third party sales as a of total pharmacy sales front end sales growth same store front end sales growth front end as a of total sales store data total stores beginning of period    new stores closed stores store acquisitions  net total stores end of period    remodeled stores relocated stores note except for revenue growth  all percentages in the above table are based on a comparable week period 
revenues fiscal weeks revenues increased over fiscal weeks 
excluding the extra week  revenues would have increased  driven by increases of in front end sales and in pharmacy 
same store sales growth for fiscal was pharmacy of and front end of 
as fiscal was a week year  same store sales are calculated by comparing the week period ended march  with the week period ended march  fiscal pharmacy sales led sales growth due to an increase in both prescriptions filled on a comparable week basis and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increases include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our reduced cash pricing  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
front end fiscal sales  which includes all non prescription sales  such as seasonal merchandise  convenience items  and food and other non prescription sales  also increased 
the increase was primarily a result of increased sales volume due to improved assortments  lower prices on key items and distributing a nationwide weekly advertising circular 
our total revenue growth in fiscal of was also fueled by strong growth in pharmacy sales of  an increase in front end sales of and the additional week in fiscal pharmacy sales led revenue growth with same store sales increases of accompanied by very strong front end same store sales growth of 
the pharmacy and front end increases were due to the same factors as described above for fiscal for fiscal  total revenue increased based on pharmacy sales growth of with front end sales declining 
pharmacy sales had same store increases of due to the same factors as described above for fiscal and as well as the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies 
the front end decrease was consistent with front end same store sales decreases of due to elevated levels of out of stock merchandise in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and the decisions of former management to suspend the weekly advertising program in fiscal and to raise front end prices to levels that were not competitive 
the growth rates in pharmacy sales for fiscal and were lower than fiscal due primarily to a significant reduction in the number of prescription files we purchased and store relocations we effected 
costs and expenses year ended march  march  february  weeks weeks weeks dollars in thousands costs of goods sold    gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses    selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues stock based compensation benefit expense    goodwill amortization    store closing and impairment charges    interest expense    interest rate swap contracts  loss on debt and lease conversions and modifications   share of loss from equity investments    gain on sale of assets and investments  net    cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted by the continuing trend of a shifting in sales mix from front end to pharmacy  inflation  increased third party reimbursed prescription sales as a percent of total prescription sales  and lower cash prices on pharmacy sales 
the increase in third party prescription sales had a negative impact on gross profit because they are paid by a person or entity other than the recipient of the prescribed pharmaceutical  and are generally subject to lower negotiated reimbursement rates in conjunction with a pharmacy benefit plan 
third party sales as a percentage of total pharmacy sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  we incurred million primarily in inventory liquidation losses related to our closed stores compared to the million incurred in fiscal also negatively impacting gross margin were higher lifo costs  higher shrink costs and the reclassification of certain leases from capital to operating in connection with the june refinancing  which caused an increase in fiscal occupancy costs 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in gross margin on front end merchandise driven by increased markdown support from vendors  improvements in returns losses and lower depreciation expense 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the slight decline in margin is attributable to a shifting in sales mix to pharmacy from front end 
in fiscal  the percentage of front end sales to total sales decreased to from in also contributing to the lower margin in was an increase in sales of cigarettes and liquor as a percentage of front end sales 
additionally  we incurred million in inventory liquidation losses related to our closed stores 
partially offsetting the items above was an improvement in the margin of front end goods exclusive of cigarettes and liquor 
these increases resulted from a more profitable product mix  and from increases in the levels of one hour photo and phone card sales 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for includes million incurred in connection with our defense of shareholder litigation and cooperating with various governmental investigations 
also included in sg a expense for fiscal is a charge of million for the accrual of anticipated loss on non recurring litigation  and million to terminate an exclusivity contract with a certain vendor 
offsetting these items are receipts of million for the settlement of litigation with certain drug manufacturers and million of expense reduction resulting primarily from senior executives releasing their rights to their non qualified defined benefit arrangements 
excluding these items  sg a as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal sg a expenses for fiscal were favorably impacted by a million increase in estimated insurance recovery related to the settlement of the shareholder s class action lawsuit  and by million received related to the partial settlement of litigation with certain drug manufacturers 
offsetting these items was million incurred in connection with the restatement of our historical financial statements and various governmental investigations 
excluding these items  sg a as a percentage of revenue was after considering the items described in the previous paragraphs  sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal compares favorably with sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal due to decreased depreciation and amortization charges resulting from a reduced store count and better leveraging of our fixed costs resulting from higher sales volume  partially offset by higher associate benefit costs and higher advertising costs 
sg a expense for was unfavorably impacted by a charge of million related to litigation issues 
excluding this item results in an adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales of in fiscal sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal compares favorably with sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal due to lower depreciation expense resulting from a net reduction in our store count  decreased repair and maintenance and terminated project costs  and the better leveraging of fixed sg a costs resulting from our higher sales volume 
store closing and impairment charges store closing and impairment charges consist of year ended march  march  february  dollars in thousands impairment charges    store and equipment lease exit charges    impairment of investments  impairment charges 
in fiscal  and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets including allocable goodwill of  and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were assessed for impairment as part of our on going review of the performance of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store and equipment lease exit charges 
charges incurred to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time management commits to closing the store  which is the date that the closure is formally approved by senior management  or in the case of a store to be relocated  the date the new property is leased or purchased 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
also included in store and equipment lease exit costs are charges of million incurred in fiscal related to the early termination of an equipment lease 
impairment of investments 
we have an investment in the common stock of drugstore 
com  which is accounted for under the equity method 
the initial investment was valued based upon the initial public offering price for drugstore 
com 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment of our investment in drugstore 
com of million 
this write down was based upon a decline in the market value of drugstore 
com s stock that we believe to be other than temporary 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of million for other investments 
interest expense interest expense was million infiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from due to the reduction of debt resulting from the sale of pcs  debt for equity exchanges and the june refinancing  which included the relinquishment of certain renewal options on real estate leases that resulted in a reclassification from capital leases to operating leases 
interest expense was million infiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we increased our average outstanding debt with the addition of the billion senior secured credit facility  which included a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we used the term loan to terminate our accounts receivable securitization facility and repurchased million of unpaid receivables thereunder and funded million of transaction costs related to our debt restructuring 
the remainder of the term loan together with the revolving credit facility were used for general corporate purposes  including reviewing  reconciling and restating our and financial statements  the cost of the audit of our restated financial statements and investigation costs 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and respectively 
for fiscal  annual interest expense is expected to be million to million 
interest rate swap contracts we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the exposure to increasing rates with respect to our variable rate debt 
as a result of the june refinancing  the interest rate swap contracts no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts is required to be recorded as a component of net loss 
accordingly  we recognized a charge of million representing the amount that we would have to pay the counter party to terminate the contracts as of that date 
subsequent changes in the market value of the interest rate swaps  inclusive of cash payments  have been recorded in this caption on the statement of operations 
the total expense recorded in this caption for fiscal is million 
this amount exceeds the initial charge resulting from the june  refinancing because of a further reduction of interest rates from the june  refinancing through march  our termination liability is million as of march  these contracts expire in the second quarter of fiscal income taxes we had net losses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal a tax benefit of million  expense of million and benefit of million including the benefit related to cumulative effect of accounting change have been recorded for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal benefit is primarily due to the favorable outcome of federal income tax litigation 
the fiscal expense is primarily due to the increase in the income tax valuation allowance caused by the sale of pcs 
the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards nols generated in each period has been fully offset by a valuation allowance as a result of management s determination that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have undergone an ownership change for statutory purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that this limitation does not further impair the net operating loss carryforwards because they are fully reserved 
based on the tax law changes enacted on march   we expect to record a tax benefit of approximately million from the five year net operating loss carry back provision 
this benefit will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal other significant charges in addition to the operational matters discussed above  our results in fiscal and have been adversely affected by other significant charges 
we recorded losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing our share of drugstore 
com losses 
we recorded million and million in fiscal and  respectively for losses on debt and lease conversions and modifications and an extraordinary loss of million in fiscal relating to early extinguishment of debt resulting from the june  refinancing 
we recorded stock based compensation benefit of million and expense of million in fiscal and  respectively  resulting primarily from the impact of applying variable plan accounting to several of our stock based compensation plans 
we also recorded a gain of million in fiscal resulting from the sale of advancepcs securities 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million on the disposal of the pbm segment 
liquidity and capital resources general we have two primary sources of liquidity i cash provided by operations and ii the revolving credit facility under our new senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  and to provide funds for capital expenditures 
our ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is based on a specified borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
on march   the term loan was fully drawn except for million  which is available and may be drawn to pay for the remaining outstanding senior secured notes when they mature on september  in addition  we had million in additional available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
the senior secured credit facility  as amended  also allows us  at our option  to issue up to million of unsecured debt that is not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries  reduced by the following debt to the extent incurred i million of financing transactions of existing owned real estate  ii million of additional debt secured by the facility s collateral on a second priority basis  and iii million of financing transactions for property or assets acquired after june  the million of permitted debt  whether secured or unsecured  is reduced by the aggregate outstanding  undefeased balances of the convertible subordinated notes  the dealer remarketable securities and the convertible notes and the senior secured notes see other transactions below

our senior notes due july also permit million of real estate financing  million of additional other debt and million of additional permitted debt  which includes allowing us to increase our senior secured credit facility 
as of march  our remaining permitted debt under the senior notes due is million 
the senior secured credit facility  as amended  requires us to meet various financial ratios and limits capital expenditures 
beginning with the months ended march   the covenants require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of  increasing to for the twelve months ending june   and increasing again to for the twelve months ending august   before gradually decreasing to for the twelve months ending may  we must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of for the twelve months ending march   decreasing to for the twelve months ending june  and decreasing again to for the twelve months ending august  before gradually increasing to for the twelve months ending november  in addition  we must maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of for the twelve months ending march   gradually increasing to for the twelve months ending august  capital expenditures not relating to the june  refinancing are limited to million annually beginning with the twelve months ending march  these capital expenditure limits are subject to upward adjustment based upon availability of excess liquidity as defined in our senior secured credit facility 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior secured credit facility  as amended  and our other credit facilities and debt instruments as of march  with continuing improvements in operating performance  we anticipate that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
however  variations in our operating performance and unanticipated developments may adversely affect our ability to remain in compliance with the applicable debt covenants 
the senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of our debt to accelerate the maturity of debt having a principal amount of million or more 
refinancing on june   we completed a major refinancing that extended the maturity dates of the majority of our debt to or beyond  provided additional equity  converted a portion of our debt to equity and reclassified capital leases to operating leases 
the components of the refinancing are described in detail in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
major components of the refinancing are summarized below new secured credit facility 
we entered into a new billion syndicated senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by citicorp usa  inc as senior agent 
the new facility matures on june  unless more than million of our senior notes due april  are outstanding on december   in which event the maturity date is march  the new facility consists of a billion term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility

on june   the warrant holders elected to exercise these warrants  on a cashless basis  and as a result million shares of common stock were issued 
tender offer 
on may   we commenced a tender offer for the senior secured notes due at a price of of the principal amount

these notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinate to our secured debt 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments to prevent dilution  at any time 
repurchase of debt 
we repurchased million of our dealer remarketable securities due  million of our notes due and million of our convertible subordinated notes due during fiscal senior secured notes 
we issued million of our senior secured notes due as part of our settlement of a lawsuit with shareholders 
when issued  we paid interest for the period from october  to january  of million 
from january   the notes accrue interest at a variable rate equal to our average bank borrowing rate plus until the final settlement is approved 
at that time  the notes will be given an interest rate  enabling the notes to be traded at face value upon determination of such rate 
other debt maturities and other obligations 
the following table details the maturities of our indebtedness and lease financing obligations as of march   as well as other contractual cash obligations and commitments 
contractual obligations and commitment less than total year to years to years after years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations long term debt      capital lease obligations      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      commitments lease guarantees  outstanding letters of credit   total commitments   we lease certain distribution facilities under a synthetic lease agreement 
the agreement is accounted for as an operating lease 
the lease agreement terminates on june  at which time we intend to either extend the term of the agreement or make a payment of million to purchase the facilities 
renewal is subject to our meeting certain financial conditions  as defined in the synthetic lease agreement 
our guaranteed residual obligation of million under the agreement is included in the table above in lease guarantees 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  a significant reduction in interest payments and a reduction in inventory levels net of a decrease in accounts payable 
we used million of cash to fund continuing operations in fiscal operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cash flow was also negatively impacted from an increase in current assets  primarily resulting from repurchasing million of accounts receivable when we refinanced the accounts receivable securitization facility  and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
in fiscal  we used million of cash to fund continuing operations 
operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cash flow was also negatively impacted from an increase in current assets and a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in other liabilities 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our investment in advancepcs  less expenditures for fixed assets and script file purchases 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our discontinued operations  less expenditures for fixed assets and script file purchases 
cash used for investing activities was million for fiscal cash used for store construction and relocations amounted to million  with an additional million used for the acquisition of intangible assets 
these amounts were offset by million provided by the sale of assets 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of repayments of long term debt of billion and payments of deferred financing costs of million  offset with new borrowing of billion  bond proceeds of million and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of payments of million of deferred financing costs partially offset by net debt borrowings of million and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of million 
during fiscal  we used the proceeds from the sale of our pbm segment to reduce our borrowings 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal increased borrowings under then existing credit facilities which replaced our commercial paper program and the sale of million of preferred stock were the main financing activities during fiscal cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from store sale leaseback transactions of million 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately million related to new store construction  store relocation and store remodel projects 
an additional million will be dedicated to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacists  improvements to distribution centers  technology enhancements and other corporate requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility available under our senior secured facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness a limits our ability to obtain additional financing  b limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  c places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  d renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and e requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon current levels of operations and planned improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations together with available borrowing under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated annual requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
obtaining any such supplemental liquidity through the increase of indebtedness or asset sales may require the consent of the lenders under one or more of our debt agreements 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or that our lenders would provide the necessary consents  if required 
accounting change in fiscal  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting by restructuring our lifo pool structure through a combination of certain geographic pools 
the reduction in the number of lifo pools was made to more closely align the lifo pool structure to store merchandise categories 
the effect of this change in fiscal was to decrease our earnings by million net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was a charge of million net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two new pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
is effective as follows a use of the pooling of interest method is prohibited for business combinations initiated after june   and b the provisions of sfas no 
also apply to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  that is  the date of the acquisition is july or later 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
is effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  with respect to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas no 
specifies that all goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives shall not be amortized 
goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on an annual basis with an initial impairment assessment to be performed upon adoption of the statement 
we have evaluated the provisions of sfas no 
and will not have to record any impairment of goodwill upon our adoption of sfas no 
 which is effective march  at march   we had unamortized goodwill of million and recorded million of goodwill amortization expense in fiscal in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and to measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
modifies sfas no 
in that it eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
sfas no 
also modifies apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  to require discontinued operations presentation in the income statement for a component of an entity that is to be disposed 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is encouraged 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
effective march  and the impact is not believed to be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables and vendor debits  pension benefits  self insured liabilities  lease exit liabilities  impairment  litigation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables 
the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
impairment 
we evaluate long lived assets  including stores  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we are subject to future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment 
as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we have performed an impairment test of goodwill as of march   which resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgements and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
vendor debit reserve 
we maintain a contra payable for returns and vendor allowances that have been earned under the terms of the corresponding agreements  but have not been charged against a payment to the vendor or received in cash 
we record a reserve against this contra payable based upon historical realization of these items and known issues with the vendors 
differences in actual results from historical experience  or a deterioration in a vendor relationship could cause write offs of vendor debits that are currently not reserved 
self insurance liabilities 
we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  worker s compensation and general liability insurance coverage 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accruals 
we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate and the anticipated rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
litigation reserves 
we are involved in litigation on an ongoing basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
lease exit liabilities 
we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  anticipated future subleases of properties and current risk free interest rates 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  additional reserves may be required 
stock based compensation 
we maintain various stock based incentive compensation programs for executives and key associates 
we account for several of the awards under these plans using variable plan accounting 
under variable plan accounting  we record expense on the awards over the option period period based on the difference between the actual market value of the stock  and the strike price of the award 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the stock will cause fluctuations in the amount of expense recorded on these awards 
income taxes 
we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness will severely limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
we had  as of march   billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders equity of million 
we also had additional borrowing capacity under our new revolving credit facility of million at that time  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
our debt obligations adversely affect our operations in a number of ways and our cash flow from operations is insufficient to service our debt  which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose  restructure or otherwise refinance that debt 
our earnings were insufficient to cover our fixed charges for fiscal by million 
our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will o limit our ability to obtain additional financing  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  o place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  o render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and o require us to dedicate substantially all our cash flow to service our debt 
in fiscal  we experienced operational and financial difficulties  resulting in disputes with suppliers and vendors 
although we believe that our prior disputes with suppliers and vendors have been largely resolved  any future material deterioration in our operational or our financial situation could again impact vendors and suppliers willingness to do business with us 
our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to substantially improve our future operating performance  which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if our cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital or other expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to earn enough to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
in  a substantial amount of our indebtedness will mature  including the debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
some of our debt  including borrowings under our new credit facility  is based upon variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of march  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor and is not covered by interest rate swap contracts 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior secured facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on this outstanding debt will also increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to o incur liens and debt  o pay dividends  o make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  o make loans  investments and capital expenditures  o prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  o engage in mergers  consolidations  assets dispositions  saleleaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  o change our business  o amend certain debt and other material agreements  o issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  o restrict distributions from subsidiaries  and o grant negative pledges to other creditors 
moreover  if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we obtain modifications of our agreements  or are required to obtain waivers of defaults  we may incur significant fees and transaction costs 
in fiscal and  we modified certain covenants contained in our senior credit and loan agreements 
in fiscal  we obtained waivers of compliance contained in our credit facilities and public indentures 
in connection with obtaining these modifications and waivers  we paid significant fees and transaction costs 
risks related to our operations major lawsuits have been brought against us and certain of our subsidiaries  and there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the us securities and exchange commission  the united states attorney and an investigation by the united states department of labor 
in addition to any fines or damages that we might have to pay  any criminal conviction against us may result in the loss of licenses and contracts that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there are several major ongoing lawsuits and investigations in which we are involved 
these include  in addition to the investigations described below  several class action lawsuits 
while some of these lawsuits have been settled  pending court approval or appeal  we are unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters at this time 
if any of these cases result in a substantial monetary judgment against us or are settled on unfavorable terms  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the sec and the united states attorney concerning our financial reporting and other matters 
in addition  an investigation has also been commenced by the us department of labor concerning our associate benefit plans  including our principal k plan  which permitted associates to purchase our common stock 
purchases of our common stock under the plan were suspended in october in january  we appointed an independent trustee to represent the interests of these plans in relation to the company and to investigate possible claims the plans may have against us 
both the independent trustee and the department of labor have asserted that the plans may have claims against us 
these investigations are ongoing and we cannot predict their outcomes 
if we were convicted of any crime  certain licenses and government contracts  such as medicaid plan reimbursement agreements  that are material to our operations may be revoked  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  substantial penalties  damages  or other monetary remedies assessed against us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in this relationship would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we obtain approximately of our pharmaceutical products from a single supplier  mckesson hboc  inc  pursuant to a longterm contract 
pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson hboc is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with mckesson hboc would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business  and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy or if they are negatively affected by general economic conditions 
our operations during fiscal were adversely affected by a number of factors  including our financial difficulties  inventory shortages  allegations of violations of the law  including drug pricing issues  disputes with suppliers and uncertainties regarding our ability to produce audited financial statements 
to improve operations  new management developed  and in fiscal began implementing and continues to implement  a business strategy to improve our stores and enhance our relationships with our customers by improving the pricing of products  providing more consistent advertising through weekly circulars  eliminating inventory shortages and outdated inventory  resolving issues and disputes with our vendors  developing programs intended to provide better customer service and purchasing prescription files and other means 
if we are not successful in implementing our business strategy  or if our business strategy is not effective  we may not be able to continue to improve our operations 
in addition  any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products  and cause a proportionately greater decrease in our profitability 
failure to continue to improve operations or a decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
we cannot assure you that management will be able to successfully manage our business or successfully implement our strategic plan 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we cannot assure you that our management will be able successfully to manage our business or successfully implement our strategic business plan 
this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other attacks or acts of war may adversely affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope 
the attacks caused major instability in the us and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence 
the threat of terrorist attacks  any military response and other related developments may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions  resulting in reduced consumer spending and reduced sales in our stores 
these developments will subject us to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores and mail order pharmacies 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
because many of our stores are new  their ability to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of customers 
while customer growth is often achieved through purchases of prescription files from existing pharmacies  our ability to achieve this critical mass through purchases of prescription files could be confined by liquidity constraints 
although in the recent past  our competitiveness has been adversely affected by problems with inventory shortages  uncompetitive pricing and customer service  we have taken steps to address these issues 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  and the percentage of prescription sales reimbursed by third parties  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  sales of prescription drugs represented of our sales and we were reimbursed by third party payors for approximately of all of the prescription drugs that we sold 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales 
any significant loss of third party provider business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
also  these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  if medicare is reformed to include prescription benefits  we may be reimbursed for some prescription drugs at prices lower than our current retail prices 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to federal  state and local regulation 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations  and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  from time to time  claims result in the payment of significant amounts  some portions of which are not funded by insurance 
we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
there is a nationwide shortage of qualified pharmacists 
in response  we have implemented improved benefits and training programs in order to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
however  we may not be able to attract  hire and retain enough qualified pharmacists 
this could adversely affect our operations 
risks related to our common stock various planned issuances of stock will be  and our continuing debt restructuring efforts may be  dilutive to shareholders 
at march   million shares of our common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of our common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes  preferred stock and warrants 
in addition  we may undertake additional transactions to simplify and restructure our capital structure  which may include  as part of these efforts  additional issuances of equity securities in exchange for our indebtedness 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which the dilution will negatively affect the trading price of our common stock or the liquidity of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  fair value at march  thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate interest rate swap  in june  we entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of million of our variable rate debt at for a two year period 
in july  we entered into an additional interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of an additional million of variable rate debt at for a two year period 
our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the ratings on the senior credit facility as of may  were bb by standard poor s and by b by moody s 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under the senior credit facility is libor plus 
downgrades of our credit ratings will not have an impact upon the rate on the borrowings under these credit facilities 
however  an upgrade by moody s to b or better would result in a reduction in our variable rate of 
to libor plus 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of march  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately million on march  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
