item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations the company incurred a net loss to holders of common stock of  per share in compared to a net loss of  per share in and  per share in the company realized oil and gas revenues of  in as compared to  in and  in the increase from to was primarily due to gas sales from the swan creek field of  however  kansas oil sales decreased  from to due to price decreases as the number of barrels produced remained constant 
the kansas properties produced  barrels in   barrels in  and  barrels in also oil production decreases and price decreases in swan creek reduced oil revenues from  in to  in this was due to the combination of price and volume 
volumes decreased from  barrels in to  barrels in this was due to the company s concentration on drilling new gas wells 
the company s subsidiary  tengasco pipeline  did have pipeline transportation revenues for the first during the years ended december    and  this included portions which were under construction 
no cash dividends have been declared or paid by the company for the periods presented 
time in of  from the swan creek field 
the company s realized oil and gas revenues increased  in as compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increase in oil and gas prices in however  the kansas properties oil production increased in by  barrels and the swan creek oil production increased by  barrels in the company s production costs and taxes have increased each year from to as additional cost has been incurred to maintain the kansas wells and also to begin production from the swan creek field for the first time in the increase of  as compared to is due primarily to the commencement of production from the swan creek field 
production costs and taxes only increased  from to depletion  depreciation  and amortization increased significantly in over and levels 
the primary increase is due to significant increases in depletion expense during  as a result of the following decreases in reserve estimates on oil and gas properties arising from declining commodity prices  certain of the company s gas wells had decreased production levels at year end due to problems encountered with liquids in the wells 
this decreased production level at year end was factored into the estimated future proved reserves calculation performed as of december   resulting in a lower future proved reserves estimate 
additionally  the company took depreciation on the pipeline for the first time in 
the depletion  depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in the increase was due to depreciation on new equipment purchased late in the years of and an increase in depletion expense of  due to a change in estimate resulting from changes in reserves 
general and administrative expenses have increased from  in to  in  to  in the increases from to are attributable to an increase in insurance approximately  to expand coverage including blowout insurance and the addition of company providing medical insurance for employees in the increase of  from to was due primarily to an increase in additional personnel  consultants and increased engineering services for reserve evaluations 
interest expense for increased significantly over and levels 
this increase is due to additional interest cost associated with financing for the completion of phase ii of the company s mile pipeline 
this increase was reduced by interest cost of approximately  which was capitalized in the first months of during construction of the pipeline and  in interest expense remained consistent from to public relations cost increased  in as compared to levels due to cost associated with producing the annual report  the proxy statement  and press releases 
public relations cost in was only slightly higher  than cost 
professional fees decreased in from levels and are consistent with levels due to a charge in of  for stock options issued in to non employees 
dividends on preferred stock has increased from  in to  in to  in as a result in the increase in preferred stock outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources on november   the company signed a credit facility agreement the credit agreement with the energy finance division of bank one  na in houston texas bank one whereby bank one extended to the company a revolving line of credit of up to million 
the interest rate on the line of credit is the bank one base rate plus one quarter percent which at the time of closing was 
the initial borrowing base under the credit agreement was million 
the initial borrowing base was determined by bank one according to its own internal and unspecified formulas 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the initial borrowing base is to be reviewed and updated periodically by bank one based on its review  at various specified times  of reserve analyses of the company s proved oil and gas reserves  such as the report prepared by ryder scott as of december  see  item description of property reserve analysis 
no increase will occur beyond the initial borrowing base of million unless the company s proved oil and gas reserves increase to such a level that bank one in its sole discretion according to its own internal formulas determines that such an increase in the credit facility is warranted 
conversely  the initial credit base may be decreased if bank one upon review of reserve analysis at times as specified in the credit agreement in its sole discretion  according to its own internal formulas  determines that such a decrease in the credit facility is warranted 
in addition  the terms of the credit agreement provides that the calculation of the borrowing base includes an equity cushion  in an unspecified amount  intended to protect bank one from difficulties in evaluating  liquidating  or collecting against oil and gas properties stated to be subject to rapid deterioration in value and inherently incapable of being accurately evaluated 
on november   funds from the bank one credit line were used to satisfy existing indebtedness on the company s kansas properties  repay the internal financing provided by directors and shareholders of the company for the completion of the company s mile intrastate pipeline  prepay a note due to spoonbill  inc for funds borrowed by the company for working capital  prepay a note due to malcolm e 
ratliff  the company s chief executive officer  for purchase by the company of a drilling rig and related equipment  and  prepay the remaining balance of a loan made to the company for working capital by edward wtgray iii  a former director of the company  due on december  
all of these obligations incurred interest at a rate substantially greater than the rate being charged by bank one under the credit agreement 
together with attorneys fees  mortgage taxes in tennessee and kansas and related fees the total drawn down on november  from the credit facility was 
as of the date of this report  the principal balance of the loan under the credit agreement is on or about april   the company received a notice from bank one stating that it had re determined and reduced the borrowing base under the credit agreement to 
the notice did not provide any explanation why the reduction was made or as to how the reduction was calculated 
as a result of the reduction of the borrowing base  bank one has demanded that the company satisfy the difference between the principal balance of the loan under the credit agreement  and the newly reduced current borrowing base  within thirty days of the receipt of the notice advising the company of the reduction of the borrowing base 
the company has notified bank one that it strongly disagrees that the re determination of the borrowing base was proper under the terms of the credit agreement 
it is the contention of the company that a re determination of the borrowing base can only be made in accordance with specific schedules provided for in the credit agreement 
the company is required to submit its first analysis of proved reserves to bank one by december  for purposes of determining the borrowing base 
thereafter  reserve analysis are to be reviewed every six months 
the schedule of reserve reports required by the credit agreement upon which such re determinations are to be based also specifically sets up a procedure involving an automatic monthly payment of  effective as of february  to be applied against the borrowing base 
the re determination of the borrowing base made on april  by bank one is not in accordance with the expressed schedule in the credit agreement which provides that the next re determination date is after december   and which would allow for updated reserve analysis reports reflecting the attendant adjustments to the company s proved reserves as new wells come into production and existing wells are re worked in its swan creek field before any re determination of the borrowing base could be made 
such updated reserve analysis reports also would reflect the substantial current increases in oil and gas prices from the substantially lower year end oil and gas prices used to evaluate the company s reserves in the company s most recent reserve analysis report prepared by ryder scott as of december  the borrowing base provisions of the credit agreement also permit bank one to require the company to provide an analysis by certified engineers on ninety days notice if it has concerns regarding the status of the reserves of the producing properties 
this was not done 
such a procedure would be the proper way for bank one to have proceeded if it had such concerns 
finally  the company views bank one s position under the credit agreement to be fully secured by the properties the company owns in kansas and tennessee 
the values of these properties far exceeds the original initial borrowing base under the credit agreement 
this fact further underscores the impropriety of the attempted recent reduction of the borrowing base and that such action is clearly unjustified by the terms and intent of the credit agreement 
the company is seeking to have bank one withdraw its april  re determination of the borrowing base 
in an effort to resolve this dispute amicably  alternatively  the company has requested bank one to allow it to reduce the difference between the principal balance of the loan and the reduced borrowing base over a period of time 
if the company s request is honored  it is believed that through a combination of the use of the company s cash flow and outside equity or loan financing it will be able to resolve any disputes with bank one 
however  any substantial increase of the pay down of the loan over the  per month presently being paid will significantly impair the company s ability to repair its current problem wells and to drill new wells 
in the event the company is unable to resolve its differences with bank one  the company might be held to be in default of its obligation to bank one  which would enable bank one to call the entire loan 
in such event  the company would vigorously oppose any such action by bank one 
if bank one should be successful  the company believes that it would be able to procure alternative debt financing and equity funding to enable to meet its obligation 
the company is hopeful that it will be able to work out a satisfactory arrangement with bank one 
even if the company is able to reach an agreement with bank one as to the amount of its current borrowing base and the pay off of any difference between that borrowing base and the principal balance of the loan  unless the company is able to increase production from its swan creek field and as a result  increase the calculation of proven oil and gas reserves it will not be able to increase its borrowing base under the bank one credit agreement beyond the initial million borrowing base 
although the company is hopeful it will be able to increase production and its proven reserves  there are no assurances that the company will be able to do so to an amount sufficient to allow it to borrow additional sums from bank one beyond the current borrowing base 
in the event that the company is unable to increase the amount of its current borrowing base under the bank one credit agreement  it will be forced to seek other options to obtain the funding necessary to meet its obligation to reduce the bank one loan and to satisfy all of its current and future cash requirements  including funds necessary to re work existing wells and continue the drilling program in the swan creek field 
such options would include debt financing  sale of equity interests in the company  a joint venture arrangement  the sale of oil and gas interests  etc 
the inability of the company to obtain the necessary cash funding on a timely basis would have an unfavorable effect on the company s financial condition and would require the company to materially reduce the scope of its operating and investing activities 
the company plans to shortly offer for sale by private placement a new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the additional capital raised from such offering will be used to provide funds for re payment to bank one of the loan excess  to pay for re working of wells and continuing the drilling program in the swan creek field to increase production and to provide working capital 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to sell such preferred stock or  if it is able to do so  the proceeds of the sale of the new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock will be sufficient to accomplish these purposes 
as a result of bank one s reduction of the borrowing base and the corresponding demand for payment of the difference between the amount of the balance of the loan and the reduced borrowing base  combined with the fact that the company is still in the early stages of its oil and gas operating history during which time it has a history of losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of  and a working capital deficit of  as of december   the company s independent certified public accountants have indicated in their report on the consolidated financial statements that these circumstances contribute to uncertainty over the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain long term debt or raise capital to satisfy its cash flow requirements 
see  report of independent auditors and notes to consolidated financial statements note going concern uncertainty 
management believes based upon the company s substantial assets and proved reserves  its expectation that production and revenues from its swan creek field will increase by the end of fiscal  and  the current increase in oil and gas prices  that the company will be able to obtain the long term debt or raise capital to enable it to continue in business 
as of december   the company had total stockholders equity of  on total assets of  the company has a net working capital deficiency at december  of  as compared to a net deficiency of  at december  this working capital deficiency arises primarily from the acceleration of  of the credit facility debt discussed above

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
contingencies the company accounts for contingencies in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of the company s financial statements indicate that it is probable an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires management of the company to use its judgment 
while management of the company believes that the company s accrual for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss  the company s results of operations may be over or understated 
the primary area in which the company has to estimate contingent liabilities is with respect to legal actions brought against the company 
see 
item legal proceedings 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  daily rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
the company capitalized   and  of these costs in  and  respectively 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
oil and gas reserves the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as at december  were estimated by ryder scott  lp  petroleum consultants 
the company s discounted present value of its proved oil and gas reserves requires subjective judgments 
estimates of the company s reserves are in part forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is also reasonably possible that the company s estimate of discounted net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly as they did in  this will result in a reduction of the valuation of the company s reserves 
this past year  ryder scott based on initial production results and the sharp decline of oil and gas prices  significantly reduced the company s estimated reserves of gas in the swan creek field from its reserve report for the year ended december  see  item description of property reserve analysis 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  effective january  sfas no 
as amended  by sfas no 
and no 
requires a company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a fair value hedge  changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments are recognized through earnings 
if the derivative is a cash flow hedge the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ending december  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets 
these standards require all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the company would have been required to adopt sfas no 
on july   and to adopt sfas on a prospective basis as of january  the company has not effected a business combination and carries no goodwill on its balance sheet  accordingly  the adoption of these standards is not expected to have an effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company entered into hedge agreements on december  on notional volumes of oil and natural gas production for the first seven months of in order to manage some exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities will be recognized in oil and gas production revenues when earned since the company s positions are not considered hedges for financial reporting purposes 
notional volumes associated with the company s derivative contracts are  barrels and  mmbtu s for oil and natural gas  respectively 
as these activities are not effective until fiscal  no gains or losses were recognized for the year ended december  the company does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   the company s open natural gas and crude oil price swap positions are not considered to have a material fair value 
assuming natural gas production and sales volumes remain consistent at december levels during the entire year of fiscal  management believes that a percent decrease in unhedged natural gas prices would reduce the company s natural gas revenues by approximately  on an annual basis 
assuming crude oil production and sales volumes remain consistent at december levels during the entire year of fiscal  management believes that a percent decrease in unhedged crude oil prices would reduce the company s crude oil revenues by approximately  on an annual basis 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility of million is variable based on the financial institution s prime rate plus 
the remaining debt of million has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs in would fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in the financial institution s prime rate approximately 
basis points would be approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remain at million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
