as a result of the sensitive nature of the psp equipment and the specialized technology involved  the doe can terminate the company s access in the event of national emergency or in the interest of national defense  or require the company to perform work involving programmatic use of the technology for the doe in connection with carrying out its governmental mission 
the company would be entitled to compensation in the event of termination in connection with national emergency or defense or for programmatic use of the technology for the doe 
marketing from may until august  indigo medical  inc indigo held the exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell the theraseed implant for prostate cancer under a sales and marketing agreement with theragenics the agreement 
under the agreement  indigo had the responsibility for the marketing and training related to the theraseed implant 
in august indigo exercised its option and gave notice of termination of the agreement 
as a result of indigo s notice of termination  theragenics regained the right to directly market and distribute its theraseed product for the treatment of prostate cancer to physicians and third party distributors 
subsequent to indigo s notice of termination  the company has executed non exclusive distribution agreements with four companies for the distribution of theraseed see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management does not currently intend to develop an internal sales and marketing organization 
the company does intend to support the theraseed brand and its non exclusive distributors with a significant increase in advertising to consumers and physicians  clinical studies aimed at showing the superiority of theraseed in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed customers and other customer service and patient information activities see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
therasphere theragenics has also participated in the development of therasphere  a microscopic radioactive glass sphere designed for the treatment of liver cancer 
the company holds a worldwide exclusive license from the university of missouri for the use of the technology required to produce therasphere 
the company has granted to nordion international  inc nordion an exclusive worldwide sublicense to manufacture  distribute and sell therasphere for any application 
under the terms of the sublicense  nordion has agreed to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for distribution of therasphere in the united states and other countries 
therasphere has been approved for distribution in canada and is available in other markets outside north america  though sales of therasphere have not been significant 
nordion was granted a humanitarian device exemption hde authorization from the fda to market therasphere 
the hde does not represent full regulatory approval for distribution in the united states  and the timing for commercial development and regulatory approval of therasphere in the united states and elsewhere is uncertain 
management does not anticipate significant revenues from therasphere within the foreseeable future 
a therasphere treatment dose contains approximately five million yttrium glass spheres that are each approximately half the diameter of a human hair 
in the treatment of liver cancer  a radiation dose is delivered to the tumor by introducing therasphere by catheter into the hepatic artery  which carries arterial blood to the liver 
because of greater blood flow to tumors compared to healthy liver tissue  the microspheres concentrate in the capillaries feeding the tumor 
the concentration of microspheres in healthy tissue is much lower 
because of the ability to place and concentrate the radiation source in such close proximity to the tumor  therasphere can deliver a radiation dose to the tumor cells five times as strong as that which can be delivered via external beam radiation 
patents and licenses  trade secrets the company holds united states patents directed to palladium delivery devices for therapeutic uses and processes for making such devices 
the company also has corresponding patents in canada  south africa  japan and the countries of the european patent convention  and a pct patent application on file for japan  australia  new zealand  canada  and europe representing european countries as well as a direct filing in mexico 
the company may file additional patent applications from time to time in connection with its existing business and research and development activities 
the company considers the ownership of patents important  but not necessarily essential  to its operations 
the company also uses a strategy of confidentiality agreements and trade secret treatment to provide primary protection to a number of proprietary design modifications in the cyclotrons  as well as various production processes 
the company also holds a worldwide exclusive license from the university of missouri for the use of technology required for producing therasphere 
theragenics holds the rights to all improvements developed by the university of missouri on this technology 
the company  in turn  sublicenses exclusive worldwide rights to this technology and all improvements to nordion 
pursuant to its license agreement with the university of missouri  the company is obligated to pay the university the greater of a fixed annual amount or a percentage of the gross sales amount derived from the sale of therasphere 
theragenics holds patents for technology concerning methods for delivery of therasphere in several countries  including the united states  canada  australia  argentina  south africa and the countries of the european patent convention  and has patent applications on file in other countries  including japan 
the company exclusively licenses this technology to nordion for worldwide use 
the company also relies to a significant degree on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances that are either not patentable or which the company chooses not to patent 
in particular  the company has designed certain modifications to its cyclotrons as well as various production processes that it deems to be proprietary 
the company seeks to protect non patented proprietary information  in part  by confidentiality agreements with suppliers  employees and consultants 
seasonality although effects from seasonality cannot be identified in relation to a specific quarter or quarters  management believes that holidays  major medical conventions and vacations taken by physicians  patients and patients families may have a seasonal impact on sales for theraseed 
research and development r d expenses were million  million  and  in  and  respectively 
r d expenses have related primarily to restenosis studies and development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  compared to competition the company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation  extensive research efforts and significant competition 
in general  theraseed competes with conventional methods of treating localized cancer  such as rp and ebrt  as well as competing permanent implant devices 
rp currently represents the most common medical treatment for early stage  localized prostate cancer 
rp has a long history of favorable clinical results and physicians have developed a high degree of familiarity and comfort with this procedure 
ebrt is also a well established method of treatment and is widely accepted for patients who do not represent a good surgical risk or whose prostate cancer has advanced beyond the stage for which surgical treatment is indicated 
management believes that if general conversion from these treatment options or other established or conventional procedures to theraseed treatment does occur  such conversion will be the result of a combination of equivalent or better efficacy  reduced incidence of side effects and complications  lower cost  other quality of life issues and pressure by health care providers and patients 
i is commercially available as a permanent implant and competes with theraseed 
a number of companies have obtained regulatory approval to produce and distribute i seeds and a number of other companies have announced their intentions to apply for such approval 
management believes that i and pd are used in approximately and  respectively  of all prostate cancer seeding procedures 
management believes that pd has certain advantages over i a seven year study conducted at yale university school of medicine demonstrated that patients receiving theraseed pd implants experienced significantly lower incidences of side effects than patients implanted with i the results of this peer reviewed study appeared in the october  issue of radiation oncology investigations clinical and basic research 
a review of early stage t and t prostate cancer patients implanted between and with i or theraseed revealed an overall complication rate of with theraseed versus for i most important  the grade iii iv complication bladder  urethra  and rectum rate for theraseed was versus for i the three year actuarial probability of remaining free of long term complications was for theraseed versus for i the study also reported that a review of the literature for patients implanted with i versus patients implanted with theraseed shows a consistently higher complication rate for i versus theraseed 
management believes that certain characteristics of pd can lead to continued improved results over i  including i a higher dose rate  which can yield advantages in treating aggressive cancers  ii a shorter half life  which shortens the duration of some radiation induced side effects by two thirds and reduces radiation exposure to medical personnel in treatment follow up  and iii unlike i  pd is non toxic and non volatile as it decays 
several companies have obtained regulatory approval to produce and distribute pd seeds  which compete directly with theraseed 
a number of other companies have also announced their intentions to apply for regulatory approval to produce and distribute pd seeds 
management believes that theragenics has competitive advantages over these companies including i its proprietary production processes that have been developed and patented  ii its record of reliability and safety in its manufacturing operations  iii the time and resources required for competitors production capabilities to ramp up to commercial production on a scale comparable to theragenics and iv the non exclusive distribution agreements that the company currently has in place  which allow it to leverage multiple distribution channels and access multiple marketing approaches and philosophies 
at any point in time  management of theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for theraseed in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of theraseed and or could have a favorable effect on market share and volumes  while failure to do so could adversely affect market share and volumes although per unit pricing could possibly be maintained 
in addition to the competition from the procedures and companies noted above  many companies  both public and private  are researching new and innovative methods of preventing and treating cancer 
in addition  many companies  including many large  well known pharmaceutical  medical device and chemical companies that have significant resources available to them  are engaged in radiological pharmaceutical and device research 
these companies are located in the united states  europe and throughout the world 
significant developments by any of these companies could have a material adverse effect on the demand for theragenics products 
government regulation the company s present and future intended activities in the development  manufacture and sale of cancer therapy products are subject to extensive laws  regulations  regulatory approvals and guidelines 
within the united states  the company s therapeutic radiological device must comply with the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which is enforced by the fda 
as a result of receiving its ce marking during  the company must also comply with the regulations of the competent authorities of the european union for theraseed sold in the member nations of the european union 
the company is also required to adhere to applicable fda regulations for good manufacturing practices  including extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities 
the company obtained fda k clearance in to market theraseed for  in general  the treatment of localized solid tumors 
a new k clearance would be required for any modifications in the device or its labeling that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the original product 
the company s handling of radioactive materials is governed by the state of georgia in agreement with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
the users of theraseed are also required to possess licenses issued either by the states in which they reside or the nrc depending upon the state involved and the production process used 
the company s expansion plans require the company to secure additional permits and licenses from a number of environmental  health and safety regulatory agencies 
the company believes  but cannot assure  that it will be able to acquire the permits and licenses necessary for its planned expansion of its manufacturing capacity in accordance with its timetable 
to date  the company has not experienced delays in licensing any of its facilities or cyclotrons 
the company is required under its radioactive materials license to maintain radiation control and radiation safety personnel  procedures  equipment and processes  and to monitor its facilities and its employees and contractors 
the company is also required to provide financial assurance that adequate funding will exist for end of life radiological decommissioning of its cyclotrons and other radioactive areas of its property that contain radioactive materials 
the company s decommissioning obligations will increase as its production capacity is expanded 
the company disposes of low level radioactive waste to licensed commercial radioactive waste treatment or disposal facilities for incineration or land disposal 
management believes the company is in compliance with all state and federal regulations in this regard 
the company provides training and monitoring of its personnel to facilitate the proper handling of all materials

these actions have been consolidated into a single action pending in the us district court for the northern district of georgia 
the complaint  as amended  purports to represent a class of investors who purchased or sold securities during the time period from january  to january  the amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants made certain misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the performance of the company during the class period and seeks unspecified damages 
on may   a stockholder of the company filed a derivative complaint in the delaware court of chancery purportedly on behalf of the company  alleging that certain directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in the conduct that is alleged in the consolidated federal class action complaint 
the derivative action has been stayed by the agreement of the parties 
on july   the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated federal class action complaint for failure to state a claim against the company  and granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint 
on august   the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and on march   the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiff s second amended complaint 
the court also denied the company s motion for reconsideration  and discovery is underway 
management believes these charges are without merit and intends to vigorously oppose the litigation  however  given the nature and early stage of the proceedings  the ultimate outcome of the litigation cannot be determined at this time 
accordingly  no provision for any liability that might result from this litigation has been made 
the company maintains insurance for claims of this general nature

theragenics is the worlds leading producer of palladium pd  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed implant 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed product 
theraseed has also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining its ce marking 
sales of theraseed in europe were not significant in any of the three years in the period ended december  from may to august  substantially all theraseed implants for the treatment of prostate cancer were sold through an exclusive distributor 
notice of termination of that exclusive distribution agreement was received in august ending theragenics contractual requirement to use an exclusive distributor 
the contract was subsequently terminated in january the company currently sells its theraseed implants directly to physicians and non exclusive third party distributors 
the company has an active and ongoing program targeted at diversifying its future revenue stream 
as part of this program the company constructed a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using unique plasma separation process psp technology being leased from the us department of energy doe 
psp technology is a method of separating relatively large quantities of a specific isotope from a specific element 
in the past this technology had demonstrated the ability to produce material for the us government to support nuclear power generation 
it was also utilized by theragenics to produce pd for conversion to pd in addition to possibly increasing its capacity and allowing for expanded use of pd  the company also believes that the doe technology may allow it to produce other isotopically engineered materials for use in medical and non medical applications 
research and development r d initiatives are also underway to support the company s diversification program 
certain pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis in coronary artery disease are underway 
restenosis is the renarrowing of blood vessels following procedures that are done to open stenosed blocked blood vessels 
the use of pd for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  a disease that leads to loss of eyesight and in some cases complete blindness  is also being studied  with pre clinical animal trials expected to begin in the company is also searching for  reviewing and evaluating external opportunities for diversification such as joint ventures  partnerships  and or the acquisition of technologies  products or companies 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
during  theragenics sold approximately of unit sales directly to customers 
in comparison  theragenics sold almost all of its unit sales to third party distributors 
because direct to customer sales are made at higher prices than sales to third party distributors  the average selling price of theraseed increased from to even though units sold during decreased from  the higher average selling price caused year over year revenue to increase 
from may to august of the company was a party to a sales and marketing agreement with indigo medical  inc  a johnson johnson company  the indigo agreement and indigo  respectively that granted indigo exclusive worldwide marketing rights to theraseed for the treatment of prostate cancer 
in july the company billed indigo million for shortfalls in its purchase minimum requirements  and indigo gave notice of its intention to terminate the agreement 
the company continued to sell theraseed implants to indigo under this agreement on a non exclusive basis from august   until january   when the agreement was terminated 
currently  in addition to direct to customer sales  theragenics has non exclusive distribution agreements with four companies for the distribution of theraseed 
these five year agreements give each distributor the right to distribute theraseed in the us  canada and puerto rico for the treatment of prostate cancer and other solid localized cancerous tumors 
one of these non exclusive agreements gives the distributor the option to distribute theraseed internationally 
a second of the four distributors also has the right  via a separate five year agreement executed in march  to distribute theraseed internationally on a non exclusive basis 
the company may continue to explore additional non exclusive distribution agreements in order to take advantage of multiple distribution channels and expanded market coverage 
several customers that had been purchasing from indigo now purchase directly from theragenics  while many other former indigo customers are purchasing theraseed from theragenics non exclusive distributors 
management expects that these non exclusive distributors will continue to aggressively market to the former indigo customers  and expects the percentage of direct sales of theraseed units by the company  and accordingly  its average revenue per theraseed unit  to continue to decline 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for theraseed in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of theraseed and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
failure to respond to market opportunities and competitive situations in order to maintain per unit pricing could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in  an increase of million 
gross profit increased slightly to of revenue in  compared to in during  cyclotrons were in operation 
during  all cyclotrons were not in operation until the third quarter 
the increase in cost of sales in over was due to the increase in depreciation and operating costs related to the additional cyclotrons  plus an increase in salary and related expenses 
the increase in salary related costs reflects an increase in headcount and an employee mix more heavily weighted toward higher technical expertise 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising  marketing  customer service and cancer information expenses 
prior to september  these expenses were borne by indigo under the terms of the indigo agreement 
additionally  theragenics incurred additional expense as the company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to reflect the possibility of nonpayment from its customers 
management believed it to be appropriate to increase this allowance because of the company s move to direct sales and the lack of collection experience with the new non exclusive distributors 
finally  compensation and benefits  and start up expenses associated with the company s plasma separation process project the psp project see liquidity and capital resources below  also increased during the periods 
in the third quarter of the company engaged a marketing consultant with experience in health care and direct to consumer marketing  and expects direct to consumer advertising activity to increase significantly 
the company also expects to continue other activities in an attempt to support its brand and increase demand for theraseed implants  including advertising to physicians  clinical studies aimed at showing the advantages of theraseed implants in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed customers  and other customer service and patient information activities 
accordingly  the company expects that these efforts may increase marketing expenses by up to million in r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the company s r d initiatives in and related primarily to restenosis studies carried out by the atlanta cardiovascular research institute acri see below  and development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes 
the company s r d initiatives are intended to expand the application of pd to other oncological and non oncological uses  and to explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
management plans to continue to increase efforts in r d as its initiatives to diversify move forward and expects r d expenditures to increase proportionately 
however  r d spending is dependent on the complex scheduling of r d activities in progress as well as the pursuit of other appropriate opportunities as they arise 
accordingly  r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
as part of its r d initiatives  the company has an agreement with the acri to conduct pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis in coronary artery disease 
early phases of the studies have indicated that the inhibitory effects of pd are similar to that of other emitters  both beta and gamma 
the company is continuing its pre clinical animal studies  and expects additional data to be available in the company has met with representatives of the us food and drug administration fda to present the results of the pre clinical animal studies  discuss further pre clinical studies planned  and discuss the requirements and timing on proceeding with human clinical studies using therasource  the company s proprietary pd source 
the company is planning to provide therasource for a human clinical feasibility trial for restenosis in peripheral vessels in however  the commencement and completion of any human trials will be dependent upon the investigator receiving the appropriate approvals and authorizations necessary for carrying out this trial  including the submission and fda approval of an investigational device exemption 
the market for the prevention of restenosis is characterized by rapid technological innovation  significant research efforts and continual scientific discoveries 
many innovative treatments for the prevention of restenosis are currently being studied  all at different stages of development 
many companies are involved in research in this area  some with significant resources available to them 
theragenics believes that the treatment of restenosis and vascular disease will continue to evolve at a rapid pace  and the company s development efforts in this area will continue to be flexible 
other r d efforts are also underway  including the use of pd in treating the wet form of age related macular degeneration 
the company has developed a prototype device for macular degeneration animal studies and expects to begin these studies during other income exclusive of minimum income  primarily comprised of interest income  was million in compared to million in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
while additional funds were available for investment during  the interest rate environment during has reduced the effective returns on a significant portion of the company s investments 
funds available for investment have been and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and r d activities  and may be used for the acquisition of technologies  products or companies consistent with the goals of theragenics 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company recognized million of other income in related to purchase minimum shortfalls under the indigo agreement 
this increased net earnings during by million  or 
per diluted share 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately and for and  respectively 
the increase is a result of a reduction in tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities during the company expects further reductions in its tax credits in the company s income tax rate in each period is lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
medicare developments the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms are promulgating changes in future payments under medicare part b that hospitals will receive for providing brachytherapy in outpatient departments 
the previously published reimbursement rates for  which were announced november  were delayed due to technical errors 
under the previously published rule  reductions in payments for medical devices of approximately to may have occurred 
after reevaluating its previous calculations  cms has now established significantly more favorable reimbursement for brachytherapy 
specifically  effective april   cms will be implementing changes in hospital payments for brachytherapy and other services provided under medicare s outpatient prospective payment system opps 
theragenics theraseed implant and other brachytherapy seeds currently fall within various transitional pass through codes  which are separate from the procedure payment codes that comprise much of opps 
during the last nine months of  cms will bundle a portion of the pass through reimbursement for brachytherapy seeds and other pass through devices with the associated procedure codes 
in effect  this will shelter the bundled portion of reimbursement for seeds from pro rata reductions that otherwise would apply this year to pass through payments under medicare law 
for many theraseed implant patients  we anticipate that the pass through seed and device costs will remain near or below the maximum amount to be bundled with new payment codes  rendering significant pro rata payment reductions unnecessary for these patients 
to the extent that pass through device costs exceed the bundled amount  the remaining costs will be subject to a pro rata reduction 
as cms officials consider opps payment policies for calendar year and beyond  theragenics will continue to work with policymakers to help ensure that medicare policies account for the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to the theraseed implant and the brachytherapy area in general 
reductions in payments under opps for brachytherapy seeds could reduce the competitive advantages of theraseed over competing treatments 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
revenue during the second half of was impacted by the termination of the company s relationship with indigo  and the change to a sales and marketing strategy utilizing non exclusive distributors 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
gross profit decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decline in gross profit margin was primarily a result of the increase in depreciation expense for the additional cyclotrons that were ordered almost two years before to meet sales forecasts made at that time by indigo 
the non cash depreciation charge related to manufacturing for increased to million from million for the increase reflects cyclotrons being in operation by december   versus only cyclotrons in operation by december  the increase in depreciation was partially offset by improved efficiencies and automation in the company s proprietary production processes  and the utilization of certain manufacturing materials and resources in r d activities 
sg a expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits  customer service and patient information expenses which had been previously borne by indigo prior to september  and start up costs related to the company s construction project in oak ridge  tennessee 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal and professional fees 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in  compared to  or of revenue  in the increase in r d expenses was a result of the company s r d initiatives  including restenosis studies carried out by the acri  and development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes 
other income  excluding minimum income described below  increased to million in from million in other income consists primarily of interest income generated from the company s short term investments and high quality municipal bond investments 
the increase was attributable to additional funds being available for investment during as a result of cash generated from operations 
the company recognized million of other income in the third quarter of related to theragenics billing for purchase minimum shortfalls under the indigo agreement 
this increased net earnings during by million  or 
per diluted share 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for and the company s income tax rate in each period is lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  short term investments and marketable securities of million at december   compared to million at december  marketable securities consist primarily of high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
the increase in cash  short term investments and marketable securities was a result of cash generated by operations  partially offset by capital expenditures 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the company also has an unsecured credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for maximum borrowings of million under two lines of credit  and an additional uncommitted million line of credit 
the unsecured credit agreement expires in august letters of credit totaling approximately  were outstanding under the terms of the unsecured credit agreement at december  cash generated by operations was million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations consists of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and deferred income tax expense 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in the increase in depreciation and amortization was a result of the increase in the number of cyclotrons that were operational during the company s primary use of cash in and related to capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity and support diversification efforts 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to the company s psp project see below  the addition of cyclotrons and supporting facilities and the company s new headquarters facility 
the company expects capital spending on current expansion to decrease in as the psp project is completed 
the doe has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as the psp  for use in production of isotopes  including pd this technology venture represents part of a doe initiative to redirect cold war assets to peacetime use and cushion the economic impact of us defense department cutbacks 
the company expects that the use of the psp technology could significantly increase its pd capacity and allow for expanded use of pd and theraseed beyond treatment of prostate cancer to new medical applications 
the company also believes that the psp project may allow it to explore options for applying this technology to other uses  including the production of isotopically engineered materials for use in medical and non medical applications  though there are no assurances that this will be achieved 
the company has constructed a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using this doe technology 
construction costs of approximately million have been incurred on the psp project through december   and the company expects to additionally invest up to million in to complete this manufacturing and r d facility 
the psp project is expected to become operational in  though no significant revenues are expected to be generated from the psp project in as part of the psp project  the company has leased land in the oak ridge  tennessee area and equipment previously used by the government to produce isotopes 
as a result of the sensitive nature of the equipment  the specialized technology involved and the restrictions on access to unique doe operated facilities  the company has contracted with the doe s primary contractor for its oak ridge facilities to handle certain technical and operational services that are critical to the project  including reassembling and recommissioning equipment  designing and fabricating new parts and modifications to the equipment and doe facilities  and operating and providing ongoing access to the doe facilities 
the success of the project is dependent on the continued cooperation of the doe and its primary contractor  which could be adversely affected by future changes in governmental program priorities and funding 
if the equipment cannot be recommissioned successfully  if there are problems with the operation or modification of the doe operated facilities  or if unforeseen challenges arise  the project may not be successful or the costs or timeliness associated with the project could exceed current estimates 
additionally  as a result of the sensitive nature of the psp equipment and the specialized technology involved  the doe can terminate the company s access in the event of national emergency or in the interest of national defense  or require the company to perform work involving programmatic use of the technology for the doe in connection with carrying out its governmental mission 
the company would be entitled to compensation in the event of termination in connection with national emergency or defense or for programmatic use of the technology for the doe 
in addition to using cash to complete the psp project in  the company expects that r d spending will continue to increase 
pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis are underway  and the company is working toward providing material for a human clinical feasibility trial in other r d activities are also occurring see results of operations above 
r d spending has fluctuated and could continue to do so depending on the scheduling and progress of r d activities as well as the pursuit of currently unforeseen opportunities 
cash could also be used in for increased marketing and theraseed support activities  and in the pursuit of diversification efforts such as the purchase of technologies  products or companies 
cash provided by financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  consisting of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company believes that current cash and investment balances  cash from future operations and credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  management may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate

as management continues to gain experience relative to the operation  repair  refurbishment  and maintenance of these cyclotrons  the company may reassess the useful lives of the machines 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness in relation to the cyclotrons 
if the company determines that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful life lives of the identified asset s
