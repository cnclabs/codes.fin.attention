item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any category 
allowance allowance loan for loan loan for loan balance losses balance losses in thousands allocated component impaired loans     graded loans     homogeneous pools     other loans     unallocated component  the allowance allocated to impaired loans for the years and was based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share  and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment 
c 
loans and risk descriptions real estate loans nbc originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
nbc originates commercial real estate loans up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the philosophy to originate these loans only to selected known borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  nbc  historically  has sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
nbc originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in their lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
in the past  very few losses from these types of loans have been experienced 
loans for multi family or more residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans nbc offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million or of total loans at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the unit which secured the loan 
nbc intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
nbc makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms which generally do not exceed five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed 
at december   nbc s commercial business loans represented approximately of its total loan portfolio 
d

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the supplemental financial data included elsewhere in this report  including the five year summary of selected financial data and management s letter to shareholders at the beginning of this annual report 
certain information included in this discussion contains forward looking statements and information that are based on management s conclusions  drawn from certain assumptions and information currently available 
the private securities litigation act of encourages the disclosure of forward looking information by management by providing a safe harbor for such information 
this discussion includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
although the corporation believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  such forward looking statements are based on numerous assumptions some of which may prove to be incorrect and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the corporation s expectations 
the forward looking statements made in this document are based on management s beliefs  as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in the corporation s documents  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  projection  forecast  goal and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements  factors that could cause the corporation s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements include  among others  increased competition  regulatory factors  economic conditions  changing interest rates  changing market conditions  availability or cost of capital  employee workforce factors  cost and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  and changes in federal  state or local laws and regulations 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of changes in actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such statements 
the two major trends that can have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are the trend in interest rates and the overall trend in the economy 
currently  management expects  based on the available information  that interest rates will trend upward and the overall economy in its market will improve somewhat during the corporation s projections  budgets and goals are based on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  it could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of the corporation s operations most directly impacted would be net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and provision for loan losses 
accounting issues note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the corporation s accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in the annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and to identify the areas in which management is required to make the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
in the normal course of business  the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  national bank of commerce  makes loans to related parties  including directors and executive officers of the corporation and their relatives and affiliates 
these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  they are consistent with sound banking practices and within the applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
see note l in the notes to consolidated financial statement and the corporation s proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a listing of all the corporation s affiliated companies 
the corporation does not have investments in any unconsolidated entities over which it exercises management or control 
the corporation does not have relationships with limited or special purpose entities that it relies on to provide financing  liquidity or market and credit risk support 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued release  which changed the accounting for goodwill  effective for years beginning after december  beginning in  goodwill will no longer be amortized 
the amount of goodwill recorded on the financial statement at december  will remain at that level until or unless it becomes impaired under the definition of impairment in fas at that time  the impaired portion of goodwill would be written off against current earnings 
at december   the corporation had approximately million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which will remain at that level unless it becomes impaired 
the amortization of goodwill for was approximately  financial condition and results of operations since  the total assets of the corporation have increased 
during this same period  loans have increased  while deposits grew by 
in  net loans grew by approximately million 
this growth was funded by deposits  which increased by approximately million 
in  the trend reversed  as competition for deposits increased not only from within the banking industry  but from throughout the financial services industry as evidenced by billions of dollars flowing into the stock markets 
during  as net loans grew by million  deposits declined by approximately million 
approximately of this decline in deposits occurred during the last sixty days of this situation required the corporation to look to other funding sources such as reallocating funds from lower yielding assets and additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
during  this trend again reversed as the equity markets turned down and cash began flowing back into the banking system 
as a result  the corporation was able to fund its net loan growth of approximately million with a growth in deposits of approximately million 
during  net loans declined by million  mostly as a result of a decline in the adjustable rate mortgage arm loans that the corporation carried in its loan portfolio 
the reason for the decline was the interest rate environment 
during that period the federal reserve lowered rates eleven times  totaling 
because of these lower rates  many homeowners refinanced their existing arm loans to fixed rate loans 
due to the interest rate risk  the corporation does not normally carry fixed rate mortgage loans on its books 
as a result of this decline in loans and an overall soft loan demand  the corporation did not need to aggressively price deposits  and therefore  had only a modest million growth in deposits during the year 
see the section entitled liquidity  asset liability management for additional comments on sources and uses of cash during shareholders equity has represented a consistent strength of the corporation throughout the years  as noted in the summary of selected financial data 
shareholders equity has decreased since from through  shareholder s equity increased from million to million or 
the decline in resulted from the purchase of approximately million of treasury stock  which was accounted for as a reduction of shareholder s equity on the balance sheet 
see the section entitled capital for additional information concerning this stock repurchase 
shareholder s equity also includes accumulated other comprehensive income which is composed of unrealized gain loss  net of taxes on available for sale securities of  and  at december  and  respectively  as required to be reported under fasb in  consolidated net income declined by million as a result of incurring approximately million of merger related expenses net of taxes associated with the acquisition of first national corporation of west point fnc

net interest income nii  the primary source of earnings for the corporation  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
nii increased in and declined by in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread including loan fees for increased to from in the primary reason for this increase was an increase in average loan yields of approximately basis points 
this increase in loan yields was partially offset by an overall increase in the average cost of deposits of approximately basis points 
the volume component also contributed to this increase in nii  as earning assets grew million or during the year was a unique year for the banking industry 
during the year  the federal reserve reduced interest rates eleven times for a total of basis points 
even though most thought rates would decline during  few  if any  expected rates to decline that far that fast 
this rate decline did not stop the general state of the economy from continuing to slip into a recession during the first half of the year 
with this slow down in the economy  the corporation experienced a substantial decline in loan demand as businesses went into a defensive position 
in this environment  the competition for quality credits increased 
this situation caused many of the fixed rate loans that were in the portfolio to be refinanced at lower rates during the year 
also  at the beginning of the year  approximately percent of the loan portfolio was composed of variable rate loans 
these two factors caused an overall decline in loan yields during as mentioned later in this discussion  the corporation s policy is to maintain a basically neutral gap position on its balance sheet 
as was stated in last year s annual report  the corporation began the year with a liability sensitive position of million or of assets  well within our policy of plus or minus 
even though a liability sensitive position was appropriate for this declining rate environment  the speed and amount of the declines caused the variable loans to reprice more quickly than the cost of liabilities could be reduced  putting a great deal of downward pressure on the corporation s margin during the year 
even though management began repricing deposits downward during january  it was the third and fourth quarters before the rates stabilized enough for the reduction in deposit cost to catch up with the decline in yields and for the margin to stabilize and begin to increase 
the decline in nii during resulted from a decline in net interest spread from in to 
the primary reason for this decline was a decrease in average loan yields of approximately basis points 
this decrease in loan yields was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points and a decrease in the cost of other borrowed funds of basis points 
the volume component of nii also helped offset this decline in loan yields  as average earning assets grew million or 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  an analysis of nii  including the average amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding during the period  the interest earned or paid on such amounts  the average yields rates paid and the net yield on interest earning assets on both a book and tax equivalent basis in thousands average balance year year ended ended earning assets loans   federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets   securities taxable   nontaxable   totals   interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits   borrowed funds  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other   totals   in thousands interest yields earned for and rates paid year year year year ended ended ended ended earning assets loans   federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets  securities taxable   nontaxable   totals   interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits   borrowed funds  federal funds sold  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other   totals   net interest income   net yield on earning assets note yields on a tax equivalent basis would be nontaxable securities total earning assets net yield on earning assets the corporation s provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the reserve for loan losses on its balance sheet 
the reserve is maintained at a level deemed adequate by the board of directors  after its evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the methodology used to make this determination is performed on a quarterly basis by the senior credit officers and the loan review staff 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of the bank s ability to collect the loan and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  a specific portion of the reserve is allocated to these individual loans 
all other loans are grouped into homogeneous pools and risk exposure is determined by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in the corporation s market  the quality of our portfolio remains strong 
net charge offs for  and were  
and 
of average net loans outstanding for each year  respectively 
had it not been for a single million loan charged off in june of this loan will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraph  the ratio for would have been 
classified loans to capital have increased from at december  to at december  the classified loans have actually decreased by approximately million during  however  equity has decreased by million because of the stock repurchase 
recomputing the classified loans to equity ratio for on a comparable basis with  without considering the increase in treasury stock  would have decreased the ratio to 
the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total loans has declined from of total loans at the end of to at the end of based on these evaluations  the reserve amounts maintained at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure within the corporation s loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses declined from  in to  in  however  it increased in to  the provision in was higher due to the level of credit risk in the loans that came into the portfolio from the acquisitions completed during and the provision included a special provision of  made by ffbs as a condition of its merger with the corporation 
the level of the provision for was reduced due to the improvement in the overall quality of the portfolio and to allow the balance in the reserve for loan losses to be at an appropriate level to cover the credit risk in the portfolio 
in  the provision was increased to  as net charge offs increased from million in to million in the primary reason for the increased charge offs was that in june  the corporation charged off a million commercial loan that defaulted 
this loan had previously not been classified as a problem loan and there were special circumstances surrounding the default 
the corporation has filed a claim with its bonding company to recover the entire million  however  it is too early to predict whether there will be a recovery 
due to the overall condition of the economy and the continuing softening in the market  management intends to increase the provision for loan losses in to a level that we anticipate will protect the corporation from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
non interest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions collected by the corporation  including insurance commissions earned by gcm  the wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary of national bank of commerce 
during  non interest income grew to million 
this increase resulted from the corporation s continued focus on diversifying its income sources so that it can be less dependent on net interest income 
several different sources contributed to this increase during service charges on deposit accounts increased by to million as a result of an on going effort by management to do a better job of billing and collecting fees 
the corporation s trust department income increased by to million 
this increase was smaller than the prior year s increase 
the activities in this area grew steadily during  however  the amount of income collected from management fees is directly related to the market value of the account assets  which in many cases was negatively impacted by the decline in the equity markets during the year 
additionally  other non interest income increased by million or 
this increase came primarily from two sources 
first  the fees from mortgage related activities increased  or  as a result of a favorable interest rate environment  which produced heavy refinancing activity throughout the year 
second  earnings from a million purchase of bank owned life insurance boli caused this category of other non interest income to increase by  this purchase of boli was executed to help cover the increasing cost of employee benefits 
these increases were partially offset by a decline of  or  in insurance commissions  fees and premiums 
this decline in insurance commissions  fees and premiums relates directly to the volume of insurance products sold 
during the first quarter of  a great deal of time and effort was spent handling claims that resulted from a major storm that hit the service area 
this took away from time that would have been spent developing new business 
also  gcm experienced a reduction in incentive rebates from its insurance carriers because of underwriting losses that resulted from these same storms 
during  non interest income increased by  or 
this increase was caused primarily by increases in the corporation s trust department income and insurance commissions  fees and premiums 
trust department income increased by  or  resulting from continued growth in overall trust related activities 
during  insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or  over levels 
this increase was caused by an increase in the volume of insurance written during the year and by the purchase of heritage insurance agency in april of this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and all commissions  fees and premiums generated by heritage from the date of the purchase are included in the corporation s numbers for the corporation recognized  in securities gains during  compared to a loss of  for and a gain of  for this relative large gain in resulted primarily from several securities that had been purchased at a discount being called because of the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits 
the corporation maintains a formal salary administration program that considers extensive comparative salary data and other indices supplied by a leading outside consulting firm 
this data is utilized to assure that salaries are in line and competitive with comparable jobs in the marketplace 
incentive bonuses that were expensed in and were paid to employees based on the attainment of predetermined profit goals 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued 
overall  non interest expense increased by approximately million or   during this increase resulted primarily from a  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits and a  or  increase in other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased as the result of an increase in employee benefit cost and a reduction in the fasb deferral because of the reduction in loan volume 
salaries were basically unchanged during the year 
the corporation made significant changes in the employee benefits that became effective at the beginning of management knew that these changes would increase the cost of benefits in the early years  but would eventually allow management to better control and possibly reduce the cost of benefits in future years 
to offset these increases  the corporation purchased the bank owned life insurance mentioned earlier in this discussion 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from increases in several expense categories  none of which were individually considered to be material 
during  overall non interest expense decreased by approximately million or 
this decrease resulted from a  or  decrease in salaries and employee benefits  a  or  increase in net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense and a million  or  decrease in merger and integration expenses 
salaries and employee benefits decreased as the result of the successful integration of the two acquisitions completed during the third quarter of the increase in net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense resulted primarily from a large purchase of data processing hardware and software in late and early as part of an overall platform automation project approved in also  there were normal increases in utility and repairs and maintenance expenses 
the large reduction in merger and integration expenses was due to the merger related expenses incurred in  which were not repeated in changes in the corporation s income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
the corporation s effective tax rates were in  in and in the decrease in the effective rate in resulted from a million increase in assets that provide either tax free or tax advantaged earnings 
the large increase in the effective rate in was the result of the acquisitions completed in the third quarter of the tax exempt income as a percentage of total pre tax income declined from in to in for the combined corporations 
also  gcm was a sub s corporation prior to the acquisition  and therefore  it had no income tax expense to be included in the consolidated statements 
the corporation s ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments is limited by the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and the corporation s normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements 
liquidity  asset liability management liquidity may be defined as the ability of the corporation to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
the corporation has not experienced any problems with liquidity over any of the years noted and anticipates that all liquidity requirements will be met comfortably in the future 
the corporation s traditional sources of funds from deposit increases  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed it to consistently generate sufficient funds for liquidity needs 
as the result of a million decrease in loans and a million increase in deposits  the corporation s loan deposit ratio has decreased from in to in in addition  the corporation increased its borrowing from the federal home loan bank during by approximately million  while other borrowed funds declined by million 
these additional funds were used primarily in two areas 
first  approximately million was used to repurchase the corporation s common stock 
for additional information on this purchase  please refer to the discussion under the capital section of this document 
second  approximately million was used for arbitrage transactions 
in these arbitrage transactions  the corporation borrowed this money at a specific rate and used it to purchase u 
s 
government agency securities at a higher rate 
this locks in a positive interest spread on these transactions over the life of the instruments 
the remaining funds generated during the year were primarily invested in the securities portfolio causing the balance to increase by approximately million  including the million in the arbitrage securities and the purchase of million dollars of bank owned life insurance 
all the remaining liquidity needs for the year were provided from normal operating activities 
the corporation offers repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of its larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
repurchase agreements  which are viewed as a source of funds to the corporation  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts 
due to the limited amount of repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under the control of national bank of commerce  the exposure of the corporation for this service is not considered material 
the following table shows the contractual obligations for the corporation as of december  obligations due in due less than due in due in after in thousands total year years years years long term debt      operating leases   securities sold under repurchase agreements   other borrowings total cash obligations      the following table shows the other commercial commitments for the corporation as of december  commercial commitments expires in less expires expires expires than in in after in thousands total year years years years lines of credit unfunded commitments      standby letters of credit    the corporation believes that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow it to meet these obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   the corporation had the ability to borrow approximately million from the federal home loan bank and had other short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
the corporation has no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the corporation does not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity other than its announced stock repurchase program 
at december   the corporation had the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of its common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
these purchases will be made over an unknown period of time and the necessary funds will be provided from normal sources 
the corporation has maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during each of the years noted in the summary 
this policy focuses on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
during  the corporation did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps  nor did it purchase or hold any derivative securities 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability management committee that evaluates and analyzes the corporation s pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for its decision making 
modeling techniques are also utilized to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  the corporation s goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  the corporation s balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive liabilities than assets that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that the corporation is slightly liability sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
it is the corporation s policy to maintain a static gap position of no more than a plus or minus of aggregate assets over a moving twenty four month period 
the corporation s position is considered essentially neutral when using simulation modeling that provides different weighting for assets and liabilities 
management believes that interest rates will increase slightly during as a result  it is felt that the corporation s current position places it in an acceptable interest rate risk posture 
management does not believe that it is in the corporation s best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions 
capital retained earnings have served as the corporation s exclusive source of capital growth over the five years noted in the summary of selected financial data 
in  stockholders equity increased by approximately million as a result of net income and the corporation s normal dividend payout 
in  total stockholders equity showed a decline of approximately  the reason for this decline was that accumulated other comprehensive income  which is composed primarily of unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities  moved from a gain of million in to a loss of million in this movement resulted from an increasing rate environment during  which caused a decline in market value of these investment securities 
the interest rate trend reversed in  and as a result  the accumulated other comprehensive income improved from a loss of million to a loss of only  this  along with net income  net of dividends paid  resulted in stockholder s equity increasing from million at the end of to million at the end of in  stockholder s equity decreased by million or 
this decrease resulted from a large purchase of treasury stock during the first quarter and the normal payment of dividends 
these decreases were partially offset by the net income for the year and a continued downward trend in interest rates  which caused the accumulated other comprehensive income to increase from a loss of  at december  to a gain of  at december  during  the amount of treasury stock increased from  to  as the number of shares held in the treasury increased from  to  the majority of the increase resulted from a march  transaction in which the corporation repurchased  shares of its common stock of its outstanding shares from its largest shareholder group for approximately million 
the corporation had and continues to have excess consolidated capital when compared to its peers  and management believed that this repurchase of its stock was a quick and efficient method of utilizing a portion of the excess capital 
the completion of this transaction resulted in reducing the corporation s equity to assets ratio to a more appropriate level 
additional information on this transaction can be found in form k filed by the corporation on april  on july   the corporation announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase  additional shares or up to of its common stock 
during   shares were purchased under this program for approximately  or an average of per share 
also during  the corporation issued  shares upon the exercise of stock options granted under a plan carried over from ffbs 
current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  nbc maintained a leverage ratio  which means it significantly exceeded the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized bank is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes reserve for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes reserve for loan losses of 
at the end of  the corporation had a tier ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of  again placing the corporation well above the level required for a well capitalized institution 
the corporation s capital position obviously exceeds regulatory requirements  even for well capitalized institutions 
even though capital has decreased since to total of assets at december   management still considers this level of capital to be excessive in relation to the amount needed to support the assets of the corporation 
as a result  management is continuing to consider alternatives to safely leverage the remaining excess capital in an effort to increase the earnings of the corporation and improve return of average equity 
some of the items under consideration are the additional purchase of the corporation s stock  acquisitions and additional arbitrage transactions 
there are no material commitments for the use of capital resources that can not be funded through currently available liquidity sources

an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result whereas an institution with a negative gap could experience the opposite results 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were less than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a negative cumulative one year gap of of earning assets

the regulators consider that effective interest rate management is an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor its irr  the company s risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
the company does this by first preparing a base strategy which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or  most likely  interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
risk control is utilized based upon the setting of guidelines as to the tolerance for interest rate exposure 
these guidelines are set by senior management and approved by the board of directors 
the december   model reflects a decrease of in income and a decrease in market value equity for a basis point increase in interest rates 
the same model shows a increase in income and a increase in market value equity for a basis points decrease in interest rates 
the guidelines allow for no more than a change in income  and no more than a change in market value equity 
however  at december   management believes the changes in income and market value equity as reflected in the model are acceptable in the current rate environment
