fourteen of the extended stay properties are residence inns by marriott  which experienced a decrease in revpar of 
the company believes that residence inns by marriott is the extended stay brand of choice for consumers as these hotels benefit from longer duration stays that include the typically slower weekend days 
similarly  most of the extended stay hotels  with the exception of our room residence inn in orlando  are in markets that can be categorized as drive to markets rather than air travel markets

the line of credit also has various financial and other covenants 
at december   the company had million of borrowing availability under the line of credit excluding outstanding letters of credit 
over the longer term  the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on its debt obligations will depend on its future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
if the company does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations  the company may have to undertake alternative financing plans 
the company cannot assume that completion of any such alternative financing plans will be possible 
the company s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to fund cash distributions to shareholders and limited partners principally out of cash generated from operations 
the company may incur  or cause its subsidiaries to incur  indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code  including the requirement that a reit distribute to its shareholders annually at least of its taxable income  to the extent that working capital and cash flow from its investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
in the future the company may seek to increase further the amount of its credit facilities  negotiate additional credit facilities  or issue corporate debt instruments 
although the company has no charter restrictions on the amount of indebtedness it may incur  the board of directors has adopted a current policy limiting the amount of indebtedness to an amount not in excess of approximately of the company s investment in hotel properties  at cost as defined 
the board may change the debt policy at any time without shareholder approval 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of the lessees and management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating profits 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under the line of credit to make distributions to the equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotels  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in hotels has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the investment in hotel 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  expects and words of similar import 
such forward looking statements relate to future events and the future financial performance of the company  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from the results or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company is not obligated to update any such factors or to reflect the impact of actual future events or developments on such forward looking statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  one being fluctuations in interest rates 
the company monitors interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of its overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on the company s results 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as occupancy 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  its annual interest expense would have increased by approximately thousand  based on balances outstanding during the year ending december  the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rate as a result of its line of credit and long term debt 
at december   the company had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million 
the company s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the company participates in two interest rate swap agreements 
one of the interest rate swap agreements is for a notional amount of million maturing in july under this interest rate swap agreement  the company received payments based on the one month libor rate of and pays a fixed rate of at december  in addition  the company participates in a second interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million maturing in july under the second interest rate swap agreement  the company receives payments based on the one month libor rate of and pays a fixed rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
in connection with the issuance of the outstanding senior notes and pay down of the outstanding balance on the line of credit  the company terminated these interest rate swap agreements at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the following table provides information about the company s instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the interest rate swaps were terminated at a cost of approximately million 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having similar debt service requirements  which could have been borrowed by the company at december  the rate assumed in the fair value calculation of fixed rate debt is equal to which consists of the year treasury of as december  plus basis points 
expected principal cash flows in thousands liabilities thereafter total fair value total long term debt fixed rate       average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate interest rate derivatives variable to fixed   average pay rate average receive rate before the spread on libor of basis points 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
in addition  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  prevailing interest rates  and the company s strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements
