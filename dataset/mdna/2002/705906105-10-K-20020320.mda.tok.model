this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements including statements using terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  potential  or continue  or a similar negative phrase or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs  plans  expectations or intentions for the future 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as adverse changes in general market conditions for business and leisure travel as a result of additional terrorist activities  action by us military forces  changes in hotel room rates  capacity adjustments by airlines  trends in the overall demand for travel  and the inherent difficulty in making projections during this period of uncertainty  as well as other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report 
pegasus actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth in pegasus filings with the securities and exchange commission  specifically including the risk factors set forth under item of this annual report on form k 
dependence on the hotel industry and impact of september  events our business  particularly our hotel representation business  is sensitive to changes in the demand for hotel rooms 
during and continuing into  the travel industry  which had already been adversely impacted by the onset of the economic recession and other world events  has been further weakened by the terrorist attacks of september   the following retaliation and the continuing threat alerts 
the overall long term impact of these events on pegasus and the travel industry is uncertain 
both the number of reservations and the average daily rate  or adr  charged for each hotel room have sharply declined following september  due to the decrease in demand 
although the recovery in the number of reservations  as compared to the prior year  has been quicker than anticipated  adrs have not yet fully recovered and continue to lag behind the recovery in transaction volumes 
since our electronic distribution and crs revenues are primarily transaction based  revenues for these businesses  which had sharp decreases immediately following september  have recovered relatively quickly and  at the start of  are close to the levels seen in the prior year 
however  since our hospitality and commission processing services are based in large part on a combination of reservation volume and adrs  their recovery has been somewhat more sluggish 
property systems and services revenues  which are primarily fixed  have not been significantly impacted 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the sales cycle for some of our services  as new customers were hesitant to sign new contracts given the uncertain economic environment 
the adverse impact of both a soft economy and the september events has resulted in a decrease in the demand for hotel rooms and  therefore  has negatively impacted our revenues in we expect this trend to continue at least through the first six months of prior to september  we completed a thorough review of our operations and instituted a restructuring plan designed to reduce our costs and improve operational efficiencies 
we continue to monitor reservations and other daily indicators and adjust our resources accordingly 
we will continue to focus on cost management and the development of new business 
however  continued terrorist activities or a delay in the economic recovery could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition
