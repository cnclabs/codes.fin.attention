total assets exceeded billion for the first time in the corporation s history 
increasing at their fastest annual pace ever  they were up billion over year end to billion at december  the majority of this growth was internally generated through the existing branch network  easily maintaining first virginia s position as the largest bank holding company headquartered in virginia 
during the year  the corporation acquired the million james river bankshares with offices in northern virginia  richmond petersburg and the greater hampton roads area 
the corporation also divested its bank centered in the knoxville  tennessee  area after determining it was unlikely it would be able to reach the corporate objective of becoming the dominant bank in that market 
total capital increased during to billion  and the book value per share of common stock rose to per share 
consistent with its philosophy of safety  profitability and growth  always in that order  first virginia maintains a capital position that is significantly higher than its peer group of banks 
at december   the corporation s equity to asset ratio stood at compared to at the end of the prior year  still higher than the produced by its peer group of banks 
similarly  first virginia s capital ratios significantly exceeded regulatory minimums and the level required to be classified as well capitalized 
this high level of capital  coupled with the growth and consistency of first virginia s net income  permits the corporation to regularly increase its dividend to shareholders 
during  the corporation increased the dividend for the th consecutive year to its current annualized rate of per share  representing a ten year compounded annual rate of increase of 
the corporation also returns capital to its shareholders through a regular program of share repurchases  and during it acquired and retired  shares of stock

with the continuing weakness in the economy and decline in consumer lending  average loans increased less than in to billion following a increase in average real estate loans increased as declines in interest rates made these loans very attractive to consumers 
installment loans to consumers  composed primarily of automobile loans  declined during  primarily the result of a concentrated effort on increasing their yield and quality 
late in the year  several of the major automobile manufacturers offered loans through their finance subsidiaries as an incentive to increase lagging automobile sales 
while this had a minimal effect on the corporation s loans to consumers to finance the purchase of automobiles  it did impact the loans to the automobile dealers to finance their inventory of new cars 
the demand created by these special incentives dramatically increased sales in the latter part of the year and reduced the inventory carried by the dealers 
this contributed to a slowing in the rate of growth of commercial loans of during compared to an growth rate in average deposits increased in  reversing a trend of declines in deposits in recent years 
a two year decline in the stock market and uncertainty over the safety of many investment vehicles induced consumers to increase the proportion of financial assets held in bank deposits

statement of income net interest income the table on pages through details the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and in contrast to the record long expansion in and  the economy weakened steadily throughout and entered a recessionary phase in march 
the impact of the september terrorist acts served to further weaken the economy  particularly certain sectors such as travel  hotel and leisure and the industries that service them 
while first virginia has no significant direct exposure to these industries  the decline in general economic activity has some impact on the corporation 
in response to this weakening in the economy and the lack of any inflationary pressures  the federal reserve reversed its policy of increasing rates as it had in and and lowered rates a record times during for a total of 
this rapid decline in rates resulted in a slight decrease in first virginia s net interest margin as the corporation adjusted its rates continuously throughout the year to match both changes implemented by the federal reserve and market conditions 
in maintaining a very liquid portfolio of both assets and liabilities  first virginia attempts to mitigate the risk inherent in changing rates 
due to the nature of its deposit base  however  first virginia will generally perform better in periods of higher rather than lower interest rates 
first virginia is relatively unaffected by movements in interest rates since it attempts to balance its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  although when rates are moving upward  it will have a period of time when liabilities reprice at a faster pace than assets 
the rapid changes in interest rates in resulted in only a nine basis point decline in the net interest margin to compared to in however  by the fourth quarter of  the net interest margin had increased to  higher than the prior year s fourth quarter margin of 
the basis point decline of the net interest margin in compared to was caused by a combination of rising interest rates and a more active share repurchase program that reduced investable funds 
first virginia relies almost entirely on its branch network to supply it with a relatively low cost source of funds  and it has no purchased funds and does not need to hedge its position with derivative securities of any kind 
this has produced one of the highest net interest margins among the country s largest banks on a consistent basis 
a comparison of first virginia s net interest margin to its peer group of banks is illustrated in the graph on this page 
the yield on earning assets declined basis points during to  while the cost of funds declined at a slightly lower pace of basis points to 
despite the general decline in interest rates  the yield on total investment securities rose six basis points in to compared to in and in this was the result of the corporation s decision to increase the proportion of securities in tax exempt municipal securities and us government agency securities  which generally have higher yields than the us government securities that have comprised much of the corporation s securities portfolio in the past 
with rapid downward movements in interest rates by the federal reserve  the shape of the interest rate curve changed dramatically from its inverted position in to a more traditional positive slope in as a result  the yield on money market instruments  which closely follows the daily interest rate markets  declined basis points to  following a basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio declined at a slower rate during compared to money market rates as a consequence of the longer term of these assets 
the yield on loans declined basis points to in following an basis point decline in commercial and other loans declined at a faster pace than fixed rate installment or real estate loans since these loans tend to be for shorter durations with variable rates that float with changes in prime or other short term indices 
as a result  the yield on commercial loans declined basis points in to  while the yield on installment loans declined only three basis points to and on real estate loans by six basis points to 
net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion for years banking companies with assets between and billion for the year in source keefe  bruyette woods the basis point decline in the cost of funds during occurred primarily in shorter term categories whose movements correspond more closely to changes in general interest rate levels 
as interest rates dropped to their lowest level in more than years  interest rates on interest checking deposits dropped basis points to  following declines of basis points in and basis points in similarly  the cost of money market accounts declined basis points to in after increasing basis points in when interest rates were rising 
the cost of consumer savings deposits also declined during  dropping basis points following a basis point drop in the only category of deposits that showed an increase in the cost of funds was consumer certificates of deposit  which increased basis points to following a basis point increase in the entire increase in is a consequence of higher interest rates offered on new certificates in  which peaked at mid year before beginning the drop off that continued throughout most of these higher cost certificates will mature in the first half of  which will result in a significant drop in the cost of funds in this category in large denomination certificates of deposit declined five basis points in  reflecting the general decline in interest rates 
while interest rates for jumbo cds were dramatically lower during the year  most of the holders of the corporation s large denomination certificates of deposit are regular customers with large balances  they are not bid certificates 
the cost of short term borrowings  composed of repurchase agreements and commercial paper with customers using first virginia s cash management programs  declined basis points to in these funds are priced based on the rates the corporation receives on its own short term money market investments to produce a positive spread 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses declined in following a decline in the decline in both years was primarily the result of a decline in the rate of growth of outstanding loans since asset quality was relatively unchanged 
in  net charge offs were virtually unchanged from  while net charge offs had declined compared to in prior years  net charge offs were higher because the corporation maintained a portfolio of credit card loans  which traditionally carried a higher loss incidence than other categories of loans 
the corporation sold its credit card portfolio in late and early  and net charge offs were reduced significantly as a consequence 
approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is composed of high quality indirect automobile loans  and the net charge off rate on these loans was unchanged at basis points in and overall  the net charge off rate was unchanged at 
the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because most of its loans are made in small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as automobiles or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules  and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
the corporation does not have any international  syndicated  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
noninterest income noninterest income increased in to million after declining in if the impacts of nonrecurring income items are excluded  then noninterest income increased in and in first virginia receives approximately of its gross income from noninterest sources  primarily from service charges on deposit accounts  electronic banking service fees and asset management fees 
income from service charges increased in following increases of and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily a result of a continued increase in fees from commercial accounts and from the growth of service charges for consumer and business internet banking 
commercial service charges increased compared to as a result of an increased customer base  an increase in fees from business deposit accounts for large customers with multiple locations  such as food stores  convenience stores and retailers  and from businesses using the corporation s cash management services 
internet banking fees increased in  reflecting the increasing popularity of the corporation s online banking service for consumers and the introduction of a similar online banking service for small to medium sized business customers not needing the full power of the corporation s cash management product for large businesses 
income from electronic banking services increased in and in  benefiting from the introduction in the second quarter of of the visa checkcard 
it produced revenues of million in and million in  demonstrating its popularity with first virginia s customers 
income from atm fees declined slightly in and after rising sharply in the late s  typical of a maturing product 
as the decline in the stock market impacted values in customers accounts  income from trust and asset management services declined in following two years of growth 
fees in this area are directly impacted by changes in market value of the underlying assets in customers accounts 
insurance income increased in after declining in in contrast to when interest rates were increasing and mortgage lending declining  real estate lending increased strongly  which also increased the sale of title insurance by 
the corporation continues to have success in selling insurance to its business customers as part of its commitment to a total relationship banking  and as a consequence  income from the sale of commercial insurance products increased in following a increase in income from the sale of annuities rose in following a increase in  and the sale of credit life insurance products grew following several years of declines 
in  there were two nonrecurring income items totaling million compared to two nonrecurring items in  which produced million in income  and two items in which produced million 
in  the corporation sold its banking affiliate serving the knoxville  tennessee  market and recorded a gain of million 
the sale was made after the corporation determined it unlikely that it could achieve its strategic goal of being the dominant bank in that area either through internal growth or acquisition 
the corporation recognized a gain of million million included in securities gains mentioned on the next page upon the sale of its interest in star systems  inc to concord efs  inc the corporation was one of the founders of star systems in the early s  which grew into one of the largest regional electronic switch processors in the country 
the nonrecurring income was a result of the sale of six small and slower growth banking offices in virginia  maryland and tennessee and the sale of the remainder of the corporation s mortgage banking activities as it began offering mortgage loans only through its website 
by the end of  the corporation was generating as much net income from its web based mortgage loan products as it had through its full line mortgage brokerage company 
nonrecurring income in was composed of proceeds received from the demutualization of an insurance company in which the corporation had purchased insurance policies and from a gain on the sale of the balance of its direct credit card activities  which were relinquished when the corporation determined credit card activities no longer met its strategic objectives or desired returns 
the reinvestment of funds from this sale and the partnering with other companies to continue offering credit card products to the corporation s customers also has produced more net income than the corporation s previous stand alone credit card activities 
the corporation recognized securities gains of million in  
million in  and 
million in primarily from the sale of equity securities 
the corporation s policy is to hold virtually all of its fixed income securities to maturity  and it generally does not have income from this source except for some bonds called by the issuer prior to the maturity date 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased in after decreasing in and rising less than in on july   the corporation acquired james river bankshares and accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
as a consequence  expenses in include the expenses of james river for six months 
if the expenses for james river were excluded from expenses  total noninterest expenses would have increased less than 
in  the decline in noninterest expenses was primarily the result of the disposition of the credit card division in  the closure or sale of branches and the discontinuation of the mortgage banking unit in the efficiency ratio improved to in compared to in both and  placing it more than three percentage points better than the peer group average of 
the corporation considers this an excellent result considering the much larger size of its branch network 
the network tends to increase costs  but it is also responsible for generating a large number of low cost core deposits that give the corporation a significantly higher net interest margin than its peer group of banks 
efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group salaries and employee benefits increased during compared to and increases in and however  excluding the additional costs of james river for six months  which are not reflected in expenses  salaries and employee benefits increased less than in despite the addition of james river employees  total employment was up by only employees to  full time equivalent at year end 
the cost of employee health insurance has increased dramatically in the last two years as medical care inflation appears to have resumed nationwide after several years of modest increases 
employee health insurance increased in to million after rising a similar in as the return on the corporation s pension assets declined slightly following several years of higher than average returns  pension expense increased 
million in following the million decline in pension expense in is expected to increase million as a consequence of the lower pension assets and a decline in the interest rate used to discount future pension obligations 
equipment expense increased in compared to in and in during  the corporation was able to keep the cost virtually unchanged as it upgraded its mainframe computer to accommodate future growth and converted james river s systems to first virginia s 
equipment expenses had grown at a rapid pace in the late s as the corporation prepared for yk  and it is benefiting from those upgrades today 
occupancy expenses increased less than in following increases in and amortization of intangibles declined slightly in and as the expense on deposit intangibles added in and were less than the expense on intangible items that became fully amortized in those years 
as a consequence of the full adoption in of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be evaluated periodically for impairment 
as of december   goodwill that will no longer be subject to amortization amounts to million 
this will result in a reduction of recurring amortization of goodwill of million per year 
other noninterest expenses increased in with virtually all of that increase attributable to the inclusion of james river expenses for six months in but not in there were no significant changes in individual expense categories from compared to in  other noninterest expenses had declined as a result of lower credit card related expenses following the sale of that area in and lower legal and professional fees as a result of a reduced level of routine lawsuits and consulting fees related to yk conversions 
provision for income taxes income tax expense increased million in to million  primarily the result of a increase in pretax income and a million increase in state income taxes 
in virginia  banks do not pay state income taxes but are taxed on net capital instead 
however  the parent company and its nonbanking subsidiaries pay taxes on net income  and during the corporation generated taxable income from the sale of equity securities and the sale of a former bank subsidiary  resulting in an increase in state income taxes 
income tax expense in was million  a decline compared to  primarily the result of an decline in pretax income 
the effective tax rate increased in to a more normal level of compared to in and in the decline in the effective tax rate in was caused by the recapitalization of a subsidiary company in  which allowed the corporation to benefit from some state tax net operating losses accumulated in prior years and which will also reduce future years state taxes 
in addition  greater investments in low income housing partnerships  generating federal tax credits  higher investments in tax exempt securities and an adjustment to deferred income taxes also contributed to a reduction in the effective tax rate in balance sheet first virginia s loan portfolio is its primary earning asset  generating approximately of the corporation s total revenue 
nearly all earning assets are funded from deposits originated through the corporation s network of banking offices or from capital 
other sources of funding include customer repurchase agreements and commercial paper originated from business customers who utilize the corporation s cash management products  which are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not fund any of its earning assets from purchased deposits or other nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize any of its earning assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  a decline from the funding rate in but equal to the funding rate achieved in the increase was due to a rate of growth for average loans and a slight decline in average funding liabilities 
the table below shows the average balances of the various categories of earning assets as a percentage of total earning assets for the years indicated 
december loans securities money market investments other earning assets 




total loans average loans grew less than in to billion following a growth rate of in and in the slowdown in consumer loan demand  which began in the second half of  continued in as the impact of the recession began to be felt 
contributing to the decline in growth was a slowdown in the growth of commercial loans  which had been strong in the preceding two years  particularly in the final quarter of at december   total loans  including changes resulting from the james river acquisition and the first vantage bank tennessee divestiture  had increased to billion 
excluding those actions  total loans would have shown a decline of approximately following a slight drop at the end of compared to in late and early  the corporation made the strategic decision to exit the credit card business and sold the entire portfolio in this area 
the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is automobile related loans  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles and loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles and  to a lesser extent  their facilities  as well as serving their cash management  insurance and other financial needs 
the corporation is one of the largest automobile lenders in the nation 
as the corporation has leveraged its historic expertise  the percentage of auto related loans increased from of the loan portfolio at the end of  to at the end of first virginia is committed to being a full financial service provider to the automobile market  regardless of swings in the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a maximum term of months 
the corporation does not participate in the sub prime or leasing markets 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages  and servicing and funding costs are among the lowest in the industry  giving the corporation a competitive advantage over less efficient producers 
first virginia uses an experienced loan reviewer in underwriting each loan in its local loan production offices and does not rely on credit scoring models 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval  generally in less than minutes  to the dealer originating the loan 
once made  the loans are serviced centrally to ensure consistency and quality of collection at the lowest cost 
demand for automobiles slowed in both and  prompting the automobile manufacturers to offer low rate financing through their automotive finance subsidiaries  including a very aggressive zero rate program in the last four months of while this had some impact on the corporation s ability to generate new loans  it was minimal because of the breadth of dealers and models covered by first virginia 
more importantly  the corporation  anticipating increased weakness in the economy  made an intentional decision to lower volumes in mid in order to improve the yield and quality of its portfolio 
as a result  year end automobile loan balances from to and from to declined approximately following double digit increases in the two preceding years 
the corporation has consolidated all of its automotive related lending under one company  which permits it to maximize its service capabilities and take full advantage of new technology 
after opening several new sales offices in the late s  the corporation did not open any in and  but it remains committed to a strategy of gradually expanding its market  primarily in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles and subject to periodic inspection 
average floor plan loans declined in following an increase in concerned that the recession would reduce sales  dealers deliberately reduced their inventories in this was exacerbated in the final quarter of the year when extremely attractive interest rate inducements to consumers increased automobile sales dramatically  further reducing dealers inventory of stock on hand 
dealers increased their inventories in as a result of the strong sales in that had left them unable to satisfy consumer demand 
home equity loans are the second largest component of the corporation s consumer lending portfolio  comprising approximately of outstanding loans at the end of after several years of declining balances  these loans increased slightly in as a result of attractive low rates that induced many customers to refinance outstanding loans or take on new credit 
december consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit  including credit card      other      commercial      construction and land development      real estate commercial mortgage      residential mortgage excluding loans held for sale      total loans  net of unearned income      residential real estate loans  primarily fixed rate loans with terms of to years  increased at the end of over after several years of small declines 
the corporation has made an effort to increase its share of loans in the home equity and consumer real estate categories and has several attractively priced programs offering fixed rate loans for years or less 
mortgage loans with terms greater than years are available to the corporation s customers through its website but are immediately sold to an unaffiliated party 
first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans with low loan to value ratios  enabling it to show a nominal net charge off rate 
these loans are originated through the corporation s banking office network 
in the first quarter of  the corporation closed the offices of first general mortgage company  its home equity lending subsidiary 
it operated in areas where the corporation did not have a banking presence  and the possibility of cross selling additional services and building a total customer relationship was impractical 
average commercial loans  excluding construction loans  increased in both and  following a increase in however  by the end of the year  this category had declined compared to the end of  primarily the result of the weakness in dealer floor plan loans mentioned above 
the corporation has been emphasizing commercial loans over the last several years  stressing the relationship nature of its program  and it has been successful in cross selling its cash management  insurance and asset management services 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its affiliate banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between and million 
the corporation originates and retains all of its own loans to businesses headquartered within its market footprint and does not participate in loans with other organizations nor in nationally syndicated credits 
construction loans declined in following two years of or better growth as several projects were completed and transferred to commercial real estate loans with permanent financing 
this category of loan comprises only of outstanding loans and is primarily for residential development projects or commercial office space that is built for the borrower s own use 
the corporation does not make construction loans for speculative or unleased properties 
commercial real estate loans increased in following a increase in and in the majority of this increase was a result of the acquisition of james river bankshares and its loan portfolio 
the corporation s commercial real estate loans are mostly made for owner use properties  generally carrying floating or adjustable interest rates 
securities the corporation has historically classified virtually its entire securities portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
however  in the latter part of  the corporation classified a greater proportion of newly purchased securities as available for sale in order to provide additional liquidity for potential loan growth in by the end of  securities classified as available for sale represented of the securities portfolio compared to at the end of it is the corporation s intention to return to its historical classification of securities as held to maturity for securities purchased in as liquidity is increased

based on contractual maturity 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
this supplies liquidity to fund loan growth and provides for a natural hedge against changes in interest rates 
the corporation does not invest in structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
average outstanding securities increased in following a decrease in and an increase in the increase in the securities in was a result of a stronger than normal growth in deposits and a reduction in loan demand that served to increase the funds available for investment in the securities portfolio 
the decline in the securities portfolio in was the result of reducing the build up in the portfolio at the end of  created to provide liquidity for potential yk related deposit withdrawals that did not occur 
despite the sharp drop in interest rates in and the rapid growth in the securities portfolio  the yield on the portfolio actually increased six basis points to 
this was a result of the maturity of lower yielding securities purchased years earlier  a reduction in the percentage of securities invested in lower yielding us treasury securities  and an increase in the proportion of us government agency and mortgage backed securities 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its securities portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with maximum lives of approximately five years 
at the end of  the month average expected duration of these securities was greater than the month average expected duration at the end of  the result of the rapid growth in the portfolio and the reinvestment of called us government agency securities 
because of the callable nature of these securities  the actual duration of the portfolio will likely be less than months 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio compared to at the end of during  the corporation designated approximately million of its securities portfolio as eligible for investment in short duration mortgage backed securities with average lives of less than five years  and these securities comprised of the portfolio at the end of the remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in taxable and tax exempt municipal securities 
over the past several years  a greater proportion of new securities have been placed in us government agency securities and less in us treasury securities 
this is due to the lower yields available on us treasury securities and their lack of availability in certain maturity ranges  a direct consequence of the reduction of the federal deficit and federal debt 
this trend is expected to continue over the next several years as the supply of us government notes and bonds is reduced 
money market investments money market investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average money market investments increased to million as a consequence of a reduced demand for loans and strong growth in deposits 
in  average money market investments increased  driven in part by a reduction in loan demand  but primarily by an increase in average available investable funds 
the funds became available when the corporation significantly reduced the level of cash held in its banking offices to take advantage of declines in required regulatory reserves  the result of programs implemented in the preceding three years 
deposits average deposits increased in to billion after falling in total deposits increased from the end of to the end of growth was steady throughout the year and picked up in the second half due to a number of factors 
on july  the corporation acquired james river bankshares with approximately million in deposits  and in august it sold its former affiliate in knoxville  tennessee  with approximately million in deposits 
the federal reserve lowered rates aggressively throughout the year and added to the money supply  particularly after the terrorist events of september the continued effects of the recession and decline in the stock markets  combined with these other events  induced a general movement to safety  and the corporation s reputation for safety and soundness attracted investors financial assets 
the small decline in was a result of the sale of six banking offices with million in deposits and the consolidation of offices into other nearby first virginia offices 
these closed or sold offices were located in slower growth markets  near other first virginia offices or were isolated in markets where first virginia could not gain a major market presence 
the corporation offers a variety of accounts that appeal to different target groups 
the firstvantage plus account  which offers an attractive array of features to the high balance customer  was enhanced in and has grown substantially in the past three years 
other accounts  appealing more to the typical mid balance customer  provide relationship linkages that avoid service charges 
the corporation s extensive branch office network creates a strong retail focus  resulting in a higher percentage of customers maintaining balances in transaction accounts compared to other banks 
approximately of the corporation s average deposits were composed of demand and interest checking accounts 
average demand deposits and interest checking accounts increased in following a increase in the corporation s extensive branch network  which is responsible for the greater mix of lower cost transaction accounts  permits the corporation to maintain one of the lowest cost of funds among the largest banks in the country 
average money market accounts increased in to million  after declining in and rising in and in these funds were rising rapidly at the end of  and it has been part of the corporation s long term strategy to increase this relatively lower cost source of funds by offering interest rates slightly higher than competing banks 
traditional consumer savings accounts declined on average during to billion following an decline in the decline in interest rates and the desire for the safety and liquidity provided by these accounts slowed their long term downward trend during  and these balances were rising in the fourth quarter 
consumer savings accounts comprise of total deposits 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    money market savings    consumer cds    large denomination cds total deposits    the rapid decreases in interest rates engineered by the federal reserve in reversed the upward movement in rates they had implemented in and in an effort to slow down the economy 
as a result of the increased money supply and the liquidity in banks in general caused by slower loan demand  the competition for more volatile and interest sensitive funds such as certificates of deposit was greatly reduced in compared to when competition was especially strong 
this permitted the corporation to reduce the interest rates on consumer certificates of deposit dramatically during the year  however  the cost of these funds actually increased basis points to during because of the high rates offered in the latter part of these higher cost certificates issued in will mostly mature in the first half of and the cost of funds from this source will decline sharply 
average outstanding consumer certificates of deposit increased during to billion after dropping in and in when competition for these funds was higher 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased to million after rising in the cost of funds in this category declined five basis points to in following an increase of basis points in and a decline of basis points in most of these deposits come from the corporation s core consumer customers and a smaller amount from state and political jurisdictions that maintain other relationships with the corporation 
the consumer certificates tend to mirror the rates of the regular certificates of deposit category 
however  the state and political certificates are generally for much shorter average duration and their rates move more quickly in response to changes in interest rates 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas 
maturity ranges for certificates of deposit with balances of  or more on december   were maturity ranges amount one month or less  after one through three months  after three through six months  after six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  other interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings consist primarily of securities sold by the affiliate banks with an agreement to repurchase them on the following business day and commercial paper issued by the parent company  primarily as a convenience to commercial customers in connection with the corporation s cash management services 
the corporation does not borrow from other banks or debt markets 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased by in to million and have increased between and in each of the preceding four years 
these increases are a result of the corporation s success in increasing the number of commercial customers utilizing its sophisticated cash management services  including treasury workstation for larger businesses and business express  an internet product introduced in for small and medium sized businesses 
long term debt consists of capitalized lease obligations on branch office facilities that are not subject to prepayment 
in addition  long term debt at december   includes million in advances from the federal home loan bank incurred by james river bankshares prior to its affiliation with first virginia 
normally  the corporation does not borrow from the federal home loan bank although it is eligible to do so 
shareholders equity first virginia has historically been one of the most highly capitalized banking companies in the nation  a reflection of its principles of safety  profitability and growth  in that order  and it maintains a capital position significantly higher than its peer group of banks 
the ratio of total capital to total assets increased to compared to at the end of and in the increase in the equity to asset ratio in was a consequence of the retention of a greater amount of income offset by a faster rate of growth in total assets 
the corporation distributes its net income to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and through the repurchase of its own shares in the open market 
in  the corporation increased its dividend twice during the year for the th consecutive year and declared dividends of per share  a increase over the declared in  which represented of net income 
book value per share increased during to compared to a increase in when less income was retained 
return on total average equity the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group during  the corporation purchased  shares of its stock at a total cost of million compared to  shares purchased in since  the corporation has purchased an average of million shares of stock each year and intends to purchase additional shares as market conditions dictate 
the corporation s board of directors approved a six million share repurchase program in and there were million shares eligible for repurchase at the end of first virginia s subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
because of the high level of capital and the conservative nature of its assets  the corporation exceeded the additional regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins 
the tier risk based capital ratio increased basis points to after declining basis points in to  the result of a decline in equity caused by the corporation s share repurchase program 
the total capital ratio increased by basis points in to due to the higher retention of earnings as a result of the decline in share repurchases during each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
asset quality the corporation has a number of policies  reviewed regularly by senior management  to ensure that the risk in lending and investment activities is minimal  while the profit is consistent with the exposure to risk 
each affiliate bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies  and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs  as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign  nationally syndicated or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the affiliated banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia affiliated group 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia group must first be shared with the corporation s lead bank  where a second comprehensive loan review is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower  and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers  both directly through the corporation s branch network and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly half of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans  but because loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the corporation s automobile loans consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially fewer risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquencies  charge offs and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs  while the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group nonperforming assets declined to million in and were at a record low of only 
of outstanding loans at december   compared to million or 
of loans at the end of the ratio of nonperforming assets has been generally trending downward since and has consistently been much lower than the average for similar sized banks in the corporation s national and regional peer groups 
there were no concentrations of foreclosed real estate or nonaccruing loans in any specific geographic location or type of property  and the majority of nonperforming assets were comprised of smaller balance loans to consumers 
the table below shows total nonperforming assets at the end of each of the past five years 
experience has shown that actual losses on nonperforming assets are only a small percentage of such assets 
the corporation expects to recover virtually all of its nonperforming assets  many with full interest

of outstanding loans at december   compared to million or 
of total loans at the end of and million or 
of total loans at the end of the corporation s delinquency ratio is significantly below industry averages  reflecting the high overall quality of its loan portfolio 
loans are classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
installment loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are delinquent days 
all other loans are generally placed in nonaccrual status when they are days delinquent 
loans may be classified as nonaccrual sooner if specific conditions indicate impairment is probable 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to an accruing status when principal and interest are no longer past due and future collection of principal and interest are not in doubt 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the table of nonperforming and past due loans on page amounted to approximately million 
the majority of these loans represent commercial or property related loans 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of credit losses for specifically identified loans as well as losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million and remained unchanged from the of total loans at the end of net charge offs also were unchanged in at

allowance for loan losses to year end loans during  the corporation refined its methodology for allocating the reserve for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of three elements a general allowance based on historical loan loss experience and current trends  a specific allowance established on specific loans  and an unallocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in the corporation s individual markets 
the general allowance is the largest component of the total allowance and is determined by the mix of loan products within the overall loan portfolio  an internal loan grading process and associated allowance factors 
these factors are reviewed and updated periodically to reflect current charge off and credit quality trends and specific risks associated with each loan category 
the consumer loan portfolio is separated by loan type  and each type is treated as a homogeneous pool 
specific consumer pools include indirect installment loans  direct installment loans  revolving credit and residential mortgages 
a general allowance is allocated to each of these pools based upon historical trends in charge off rates  current delinquency ratios and loan characteristics 
consumer loans tend to be for relatively short durations of three to seven years and have fairly consistent charge off experience 
a general allowance is also allocated to a portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
each commercial and commercial real estate loan is assigned a risk rating by the loan officer based on established credit policy guidelines 
these risk ratings are periodically reviewed  and all ratings are subject to independent review 
loans receiving a risk rating of average or above are aggregated and assigned an allocation percentage which when multiplied by the dollar amount of loans results in a general allowance for these loans 
the allocation percentage is based upon historical loss rates adjusted for current conditions 
loans receiving a below average rating  excluding nonperforming loans in excess of  are assigned a specific allowance based upon the level of classification 
each nonperforming loan in excess of  is reviewed and a specific allowance established 
the amount of specific allowance assigned is based upon an assessment of probable sources of repayment including cash flow  collateral value  and the capacity of guarantors  if any 
the unallocated allowance comprised of the total allowance as of december   and is based on management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured by any component of the allowance 
this evaluation includes but is not limited to general economic trends  business conditions affecting key lending areas  changes in credit quality  collateral values  loan volumes  concentrations of credit risk  results of internal credit reviews and regulatory examinations 
the amount of reserves allocated to the major loan categories as of december   is indicated in the following table percent allowance december of loans allocation consumer indirect installment  direct installment  revolving credit  commercial  construction and land development real estate commercial mortgage  residential mortgage  unallocated  total allowance for loan losses  liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in substantially all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average expected duration of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  up from months at the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio is typically between two and three years as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the affiliate banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
between after maturity ranges and one year one and five interest rate sensitivity or less five years years total commercial     construction and land development     total     fixed rate loans    floating rate loans    total    home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
the majority of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the table on the preceding page 
first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s affiliate banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income

x x x is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declines to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money market accounts at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the preceding table 
however  the degree and frequency of movement are more limited in practice  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible 
the table beginning on the previous page shows the corporation s interest sensitivity position at december  first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more dynamic version of the information shown in the preceding table that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities 
these adjustments take into account that interest rates on individual asset and liability categories may change at a different pace from their contractual rate 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rates 
while first virginia s liability sensitivity in the short term indicates that an increase in interest rates may negatively affect short term net interest income  management would likely take actions to minimize its exposure to negative results and within a relatively short period of time make adjustments so that net interest income would not be materially impacted 
for example  the corporation s net interest margin has averaged over the past ten years and has exceeded every year since  despite wide changes in interest rates 
during  short term interest rates declined a total of basis points yet the corporation s net interest margin declined only nine basis points  and by the fourth quarter  it exceeded the net interest margin in the prior year s fourth quarter before interest rate levels had begun to decline 
at the same time  the corporation has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in loan and deposit demands 
using shock analysis of a hypothetical  immediate increase in all interest rates of basis points and comparing that to the anticipated interest rate environment over the next months also indicates that net interest income would decrease by  while an immediate and hypothetical decrease in rates of basis points would increase net interest income by 
such an immediate change in all rates would be highly unlikely in management s opinion 
the corporation s dynamic simulation modeling takes into account the effects such changes may have on overall economic activity  the reaction of individual categories of assets and liabilities  and the impact that different management actions may have on net interest income 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the volatility its interest sensitive gap position or shock analysis may indicate 
over time  or under stable interest rate conditions  net interest income will tend to be greater at higher interest rate levels 
this is due to the large proportion of low cost core deposits such as demand  interest checking  savings and money market accounts comprising the corporation s funding sources  which can be invested in relatively higher yielding loans and investments

quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders 
the results of operations for each of the quarters during the two years ended december   are summarized in the table on pages and the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
for the fourth quarter of  first virginia s earnings per share increased to 
compared to 
earned in the fourth quarter  excluding million in nonrecurring after tax gains from the sale of five branch offices in the fourth quarter 
the return on average assets was compared to in the prior year s fourth quarter  and the return on average shareholders equity was compared to  excluding the nonrecurring income 
net income for the quarter  including the nonrecurring income in  increased to million or 
per share compared to million or 
per share in cash basis recurring income increased to million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
cash basis recurring income produced a return on average tangible assets of in the fourth quarter of and a return on average tangible shareholders equity of 
average deposit growth was strong in the fourth quarter  increasing at an annualized rate of to billion compared to billion in the third quarter  and was up over the prior year s fourth quarter of billion 
average short term borrowings  consisting almost entirely of commercial customers utilizing the corporation s cash management services  increased during the fourth quarter to million compared to million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
the combination of the recession and zero interest loans by the automobile manufacturers impacted the corporation s new loan originations 
average loans declined at a annualized rate in the fourth quarter to billion compared to billion in the third quarter  but were up compared to the fourth quarter of the annualized decline in average commercial loans in the fourth quarter was caused by seasonal lower demand from automobile dealers for floor plan loans coupled with reduced dealer inventories as a result of strong auto sales 
average consumer loans rose at an annualized rate of compared to the third quarter and real estate loans increased at an annualized rate of as consumers took advantage of historically low interest rates 
the net interest margin increased eight basis points to during the fourth quarter compared to in the third quarter and was up three basis points compared to in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter the federal reserve lowered interest rates three times  totaling  following eight previous reductions in rates in the year for a total of during excluding a million nonrecurring gain on the sale of five branch offices in the fourth quarter  noninterest income increased at a rate to million in the fourth quarter of service charges on deposit accounts increased at a pace in the fourth quarter  led by a increase in commercial service charges and by a increase in retail service charges 
the growth in commercial service charges was a result of an increased customer base  higher volumes of business  and expanded utilization of the corporation s transaction processing and cash management services 
the increase in retail fees was primarily a consequence of an increase in the number of customers utilizing the corporation s internet banking services 
electronic banking service fees increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter as a result of increased penetration and usage of the corporation s debit card programs 
the increase in income from the sale of insurance products in the fourth quarter was the result of increases in the sale of commercial insurance lines and in title insurance caused by a higher volume of real estate loan originations 
other income  excluding the gain from the sale of branch offices in the fourth quarter  increased on the strength of higher sales of co branded credit card products and deposit oriented programs 
noninterest expense increased compared to the fourth quarter of but was up only for the full year 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits in the fourth quarter of is attributed to higher insurance expenses and the addition of james river bankshares employees who were not included in the fourth quarter 
most other categories of expense were relatively unchanged compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
the efficiency ratio  which continued to improve  was in the fourth quarter compared to in quarter ended dec
