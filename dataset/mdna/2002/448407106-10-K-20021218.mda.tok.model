item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently sell a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components based on several standard designs to manufacturers of disk drives and manufacturers of disk drive components including alps  fujitsu  ibm  innovex  krp  read rite  sae and seagate 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations have been adversely affected from time to time due to disk drive industry slowdowns  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market share and our customers market share  our customers production yields and our own product transitions 
since  improvements in data density  the amount of data which can be stored on magnetic disks  have outpaced disk drive storage capacity requirements 
this enabled disk drive manufacturers to reduce their costs by using fewer components  including suspension assemblies  in each drive 
shifts in our position in the marketplace had also  to a lesser extent  decreased demand for our products 
slower growth of disk drive storage demand and a weaker global economy have also decreased demand for our products since consequently  our shipments declined from million in to million in while improvements in data density and slower growth of disk drive storage demand continued to reduce our demand in  improvements in our market position increased our demand in the latter part of our shipments of suspension assemblies for the fourth quarter of were million  higher than the levels we saw in quarter one of we expect our shipments in quarter one of to be higher than quarter four of due to an increase in disk drive production and a temporary increase in tsa suspension consumption resulting from lower production yields at some of our customers related to their transition to higher density recording heads 
we continue to have limited visibility for future demand 
our selling prices are subject to pricing pressure from our customers and market pressure from our competitors 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when a product is introduced  decreasing prices when it is mature  and slightly increasing pricing as it is phased out 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yield and production efficiency to reduce its cost 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our just in time inventory hubs 
customers typically prefer a dual source supply and  therefore  they allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross margins and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our gross margins have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors such as changes in demand or customer requirements product mix selling prices the level of utilization of our production capacity increases in production and engineering costs associated with production of new products manufacturing yields and production efficiency changes in the cost of raw materials gross margins were positively impacted in primarily by cost reduction efforts completed during and productivity improvements in the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and our customers operating results are dependent on being the first to market and first to volume with new products at a low cost 
our ability to respond to our customers needs for new products and product features on a timely basis is an important factor in our success 
our dedicated development center enables us to shorten development cycles and achieve high volume output per manufacturing unit more quickly 
new suspension assembly types have lower manufacturing yields and are produced in smaller quantities than more mature products 
manufacturing yields generally improve as the product matures and production volumes increase 
manufacturing yields also vary depending on the complexity and uniqueness of product specifications 
because our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs  gross margins are also extremely sensitive to changes in volume 
small variations in capacity utilization or manufacturing yields generally have a significant impact on gross margins 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our operating margins depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure  our suspension assembly production capacity and our workforce 
during the past three years  we consolidated some of our manufacturing operations to make better use of existing equipment and support staff across all of our plants and to reduce costs 
as part of our efforts to improve our operating margins through reduced costs and improved efficiency  we reduced our overall employment level  through workforce reductions and managed attrition  from  at the end of to  at the end of market trends we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  personal computers  increasingly complex software and the emergence of new applications for disk storage  such as digital video recording  gaming consoles  digital cameras and other consumer applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand in the future 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models 
improvements in data density of disk drives  extending from the desktop market to server drives  have reduced unit shipments of suspension assemblies since the third quarter of however  data density improvements have grown at a slower rate in the past year  and we believe they will continue to grow at a slower rate in the upcoming year 
we expect that world wide suspension assembly shipments will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future until at least one of the following events occurs average suspension assembly counts within disk drives stabilize or increase  or overall disk drive demand growth increases 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the storage device of choice for applications requiring low access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per megabyte of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increasing data density and lower storage costs are leading to further adoption of value added features for tsa suspensions  such as extended arms  headlifts  limiters  static dissipative coatings and switch shunts 
tsa suspensions also allow for dual stage actuation  which incorporates a second stage actuator on the suspension to improve head positioning over increasingly tighter data tracks 
additionally  tsa suspensions can be configured to allow for attachment of preamplifiers near the head to improve data transfer signals 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and new disk drive designs tends to initially decrease customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
we believe reduced yields at some of our customers due to their transition to higher density recording heads is resulting in increased shipments of our suspension assemblies in quarter one of as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new heads and new drive designs may require rapid development and implementation of new suspension assembly types which temporarily may reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us 
operations to operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses litigation settlement asset impairment and restructuring charges income loss from operations other income  net loss on debt extinguishment interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales for were  a decrease of  or compared to suspension assembly sales decreased  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in suspension assembly sales volume and declining average selling prices for suspension assemblies 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in suspension assembly component sales 
gross profit for was  compared to  for  and gross profit as a percent of net sales increased from to 
this increase was primarily due to the cost reduction efforts completed during and productivity improvements in labor and benefits expenses were reduced by  as a result of workforce reductions and productivity improvements  and depreciation decreased  as a result of the asset impairment charges recorded in and lower capital expenditures in and inventory scrap costs were also reduced by  in these improvements were partially offset by the lower suspension assembly sales volume and lower average selling prices noted above 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for the decrease was primarily due to customer funding of a portion of our advanced suspension assembly development costs and reduced product development costs in our biomeasurement division 
suspension assembly product and process development accounted for  of such expenses  and the remaining  was used for ongoing product development and clinical research related to the medical device developed by our biomeasurement division 
as a percent of net sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or compared to the increase was due primarily to a  increase in incentive compensation costs  and to a lesser extent  higher bad debt expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in legal and professional fees and a  reduction in labor and benefits expenses and  to a lesser extent  lower depreciation and lease expenses  reduced recruitment and relocation expenses  and lower travel and training costs 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in during the first quarter of  we recorded an increase to operating income of  as a result of a reimbursement of legal expenses from a third party and insurance proceeds related to litigation defense costs 
see note  litigation settlement  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other income  net  for was  a decrease of  compared to other income  net  primarily consisted of interest income  royalty income and rental income 
interest income decreased from  in to  in as a result of lower investment yields 
during the fourth quarter of  we extinguished  of senior unsecured notes and  of convertible subordinated notes before their maturity 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a  pre tax loss on debt extinguishment 
see note  financing arrangements  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for was  a decrease of  compared to  primarily due to carrying a lower amount of outstanding debt and fewer capitalized leases 
the income tax provision for was based on an estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year of  which is below the statutory federal rate primarily due to the benefit derived from the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions related to export of us products 
net income for was  compared to a net loss of  for our improved profitability was primarily due to cost reduction efforts completed during and productivity improvements in net income for included the above mentioned increase to operating income and loss on debt extinguishment 
the net loss included charges of  for asset write downs and severance costs 
excluding these items  net income loss as a percent of net sales  increased from in to in operations to operations net sales for were  a decrease of  or compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in suspension assembly sales volume of million  partially offset by higher average selling prices of per part 
gross profit for was  compared to  for  and gross profit as a percent of net sales increased from to 
this increase was primarily due to lower manufacturing labor and benefits expenses as a result of the workforce reductions that occurred during and and lower depreciation expense  offset primarily by the lower suspension assembly sales volume noted above 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for suspension assembly product and process development accounted for  of such expenses  and the remaining  was used for the development of our biomeasurement device 
during fiscal  we recorded charges of  to write down certain assets and record severance costs for approximately terminated employees 
components of the charges included  of asset write downs of impaired manufacturing equipment and an unfinished facility in eau claire  wisconsin  and  of severance costs 
see note  asset impairment and restructuring charges  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our financial results for subsequent years will be impacted favorably by lower depreciation  lease and labor expenses as a consequence of these charges 
the charges taken in and in are expected to produce an estimated annual labor savings of approximately  the charges taken in and in also are expected to produce savings of depreciation and lease costs of approximately    and  for the fiscal years through  respectively  and thereafter an aggregate of  in additional savings 
we will continue to have excess capacity until some combination of the following events occurs average component counts within disk drives stabilize or increase  or overall disk drive demand growth increases or our share of certain drive programs increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or compared to the increased expenses were due primarily to increased legal and professional fees of  this increase was offset partially by the absence of  of charges  recorded in the comparable period in  as a result of the difference between payments made to purchase certain leased equipment over the fair market value of such equipment  together with decreased bad debt expenses of  and decreased health and dental expenses of  as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from to other income  net  for was  an increase of  compared to the increase was primarily due to a  decrease in losses on disposals of assets and a  development subsidy 
interest expense for was  an increase of  compared to  primarily due to an increase of approximately  of interest expense on capitalized leases 
the income tax benefit for was based on an estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year of  which is below the statutory federal rate primarily due to the uncertainty related to our ability to offset future income with net operating losses 
the net loss for was  compared to a net loss of  for the and net losses included the above mentioned asset write down and severance costs 
excluding these costs  the net loss as a percent of net sales increased from for to for liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at september  to  at september  our securities available for sale increased from  to  during the same period 
overall  this reflects a  decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale  primarily due to a prepayment of certain expenses made in the second quarter of related to a technology and development agreement and an extinguishment of certain debt instruments in the fourth quarter of we generated cash from operating activities of  in   in and  in as of september   our  credit facility had a borrowing base of  secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
letters of credit and loans outstanding under this facility totaled  as of such date  including  issued in connection with obligations under equipment leases 
the amount we can borrow under this credit facility is limited by the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of september    of borrowing capacity remained available to us 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  in compared to  in and  in the capital expenditures for were primarily for new program tooling and process technology and capability improvements 
we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately  during primarily for new program tooling  process technology and capability improvements and new business systems 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from internally generated funds  cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
during the fourth quarter of  we extinguished  of senior unsecured notes before their maturity at a pre tax loss of  these notes accrued interest at rates ranging from to and were due in july through october of we also repurchased  of convertible subordinated notes at a pre tax gain of  these notes had a maturity date of march  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we repurchased an additional  of convertible subordinated notes at a pre tax gain of  the total extinguishment of  of debt will reduce our interest expense in by approximately  our debt to equity ratio improved from percent at the end of to percent at the end of certain of our existing financing agreements contain financial covenants and covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and may restrict our ability to enter into certain types of financing 
as of september   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
if  however  we are not in compliance with financial covenants in our financing agreements at the end of any future quarter and cannot obtain amendments on terms acceptable to us  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash generated from operations and credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements and capital expenditures through we will pursue additional debt or equity financing to supplement our current capital resources if needed beyond our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the delivery has occurred to the customers premises 
we also store inventory in warehouses jit hubs that are located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from jit hubs upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into reimbursement arrangements with customers that provide for reimbursement of guaranteed capacity 
we recognize the associated revenue over the life of the program for which the capacity is guaranteed 
accounts receivable we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable is highly concentrated 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectability based on past transaction history with the customer and the customer s financial condition 
while we perform ongoing credit reviews of our customers and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any significant customer may result in additional charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or to write off certain accounts 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns on sales of products in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
we base the allowance on historical returns as well as existing product return notifications 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer  or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of september   due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters we are involved in certain legal matters which may result in additional future cash requirements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to certain recent accounting pronouncements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  non audit services approved in the fourth quarter by the audit committee of our board of directors and to be performed by deloitte touche llp  our independent auditors  are as follows i tax compliance services  ii tax planning services  and iii tax controversy services 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
forward looking statements the statements under the headings business industry background  products and competition about demand for and shipments of disk drives  suspension assemblies  including tsa suspensions  and suspension assembly components and disk drive and tsa suspension technology and development  the statements under the headings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and market trends about demand for and shipments of disk drives and suspension assemblies  including tsa suspensions  the statements under the heading business risk factors about our future operating results  and the statements under the headings business risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources about capital expenditures and capital resources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including slower or faster customer acceptance and adoption of new product features  fluctuating order rates  faster or slower improvements in disk drive data densities which affect suspension assembly and component demand  changes in market consumption of disk drives or suspension assemblies  difficulties in producing our tsa suspensions  difficulties in managing capacity  changes in manufacturing efficiencies and the other risks and uncertainties discussed above 
these factors may cause our actual future results to differ materially from historical earnings and from the financial performance we presently anticipate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc carries interest rate risk  in connection with certain borrowings under the working capital line it provides  that is generally related to either libor or the prime rate 
if either of these rates were to change while we had such borrowings outstanding under the working capital line provided by the credit facility  interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
at september   there was  in outstanding borrowings under the working capital line provided by the credit facility 
our variable rate demand note note also carries interest rate risk that is generally related to the day united states treasury bill interest rate 
at september   the outstanding principal amount of the note was  which was subject to an interest rate of 
we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our other debt obligations which are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our sales transactions are denominated in united states dollars and thus are not subject to risk due to currency exchange fluctuations
