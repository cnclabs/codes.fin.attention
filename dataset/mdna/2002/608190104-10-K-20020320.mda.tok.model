compound average growth rates in units measured in square yards for each of these categories for the period from through have exceeded gross domestic product of the united states over the same period 
during this period  the compound average growth rate was for carpet and rugs  for ceramic tile  for vinyl and rubber and for hardwood 
laminate  which is a relatively new product  experienced a compound average growth rate of from through although beginning from a smaller base  the growth rates for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer preference for these products for certain applications 
in response to this increasing demand  the company has increased its distribution of hard surface products  including ceramic tile  vinyl  hardwood and laminate 
the acquisition of dal tile provides a unique opportunity to help the company achieve its strategic goal of becoming one of the world s leading floorcovering manufacturers and distributors 
the company considers its most critical accounting policies to include its accounts receivable and revenue recognition  inventories and income tax policies because they are most important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments

impact of inflation inflation affects the company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel related costs 
in the past  the company has generally passed along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the united states and mexico 
seasonality the company is a calendar year end company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
the second  third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income 
these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 
certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of mohawk common stock 
if any of the events described in these risks were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to integrate mohawk and dal tile successfully by managing the challenges of that integration may result in the company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the merger 
the company will face challenges in consolidating functions  integrating its organizations  procedures  operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel 
these challenges will result principally because the two companies currently 
maintain executive offices in different locations  
manufacture and sell different types of products through different distribution channels  
conduct their businesses from various locations  
maintain different operating systems and software on different computer hardware  and 
have different employment and compensation arrangements for their employees 
in addition  dal tile has a significant manufacturing operation in mexico  and the company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility outside of the united states 
as a result  the integration will be complex and will require additional attention from members of management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  level of expenses and operating results 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling 
new construction activity and remodeling to a lesser degree  are cyclical in nature and a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction activity is significantly affected by numerous factors  all of which are beyond the company s control  including 
national and local economic conditions  
interest rates  
housing demand  
employment levels  
changes in disposable income  
financing availability  
commercial rental vacancy rates  
federal and state income tax policies  and 
consumer confidence 
the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past  which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry  including suppliers of floorcoverings 
the industry could experience similar downturns in the future  which could have a negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces intense competition in its industry  which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the industry is highly competitive 
the company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products 
some of its existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than it does 
maintaining the company s competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products and in the loss of market share 
in addition  the company faces  and will continue to face  pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors  as well as from large customers 
as a result of any of these factors  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s sales and profitability 
a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates  to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities  it may not be able to 
successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  
obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  
complete acquisitions  or 
profitably manage acquired businesses 
acquired operations may not achieve levels of sales  operating income or productivity comparable to those of its existing operations  or otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions may also involve a number of special risks  some or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  including  among others 
the company s inability to integrate operations  systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and excess costs effectively  
diversion of management s attention and resources  and 
difficulty retaining and training acquired key personnel 
the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company s business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers 
the principal raw materials used in its manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin  which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business  talc  clay  impure nepheline syenite  pure nepheline syenite and various glazes  including frit ground glass  zircon and stains  which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business  and other materials 
the company purchases all of its impure nepheline syenite requirements from minnesota mining and manufacturing company and all of its pure nepheline syenite requirements from unimin corporation 
unimin is the only major supplier of pure nepheline syenite in north america 
an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy  which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
significant increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas used in the manufacture of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on its operating margins and its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company purchases nylon fiber  polypropylene resin  talc  clay  impure nepheline syenite  pure nepheline syenite  frit  zircon  stains and other materials from third party suppliers 
the cost of some of these materials  like nylon and polypropylene resin  is related to oil prices 
the company also purchases significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in some of its production processes 
the prices of these raw materials and of natural gas vary with market conditions 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers  the company s ability to do so is  to a large extent  dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during such periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company has been  and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  which could be significant 
the company s operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the use  storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment  to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts 
new or additional requirements could be imposed  and the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations 
the nature of the company s operations and previous operations by others at real property currently or formerly owned or operated by the company and the disposal of waste at third party sites exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 
the company has been  and will continue to be  subject to these claims 
the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  changes in environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  enforcement of existing or new requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to expenditures and liabilities  including fines or penalties  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company relies on its monterrey  mexico plant for a significant portion of its ceramic tile manufacturing capacity and any disruption in the plant s operations could negatively affect the company s business 
the company s monterrey  mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the company s total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile 
this facility contains five distinct manufacturing plants  three of which produce ceramic tile  one of which produces frit used in the production of manufactured tile and one of which produces refractories 
any disruption in the operations of this facility could result in a material adverse effect on the company s ceramic tile business and the company s operations as a whole 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s operations in mexico include its monterrey facility 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on the company s mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on its operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states  and the company s mexican operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks  including 
changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  affecting the company s import and export activities in mexico  
changes in mexican labor laws and regulations affecting the company s ability to hire and retain employees in mexico  
currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
local laws concerning repatriation of profits  
political conditions in mexico  
unexpected changes in the regulatory environment in mexico  and 
changes in general economic conditions in mexico 
future exchange rate fluctuations or inflation could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s mexican facility  which is considered an extension of its us operations  primarily provides ceramic tile to the company s us distribution network  and to a more limited extent  sells ceramic tile in mexico 
the facility has more peso denominated expenses than revenues 
this means that the company realizes a benefit when the peso devalues against the us dollar  although this benefit may be offset by mexican inflation 
any future increases in the mexican inflation rate  which are not offset by devaluation of the peso  may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the mexican peso has been and may in the future be  subject to significant fluctuations 
to the extent that the peso appreciates against the us dollar  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the north american free trade agreement 
the united states is party to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
under gatt  the united states currently imposes import duties on ceramic tile imported from countries outside north america at no more than  to be reduced ratably to no less than by accordingly  as these duties decrease  gatt may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these countries  which now export  or may seek to export  ceramic tile to the united states 
the company is uncertain what effect gatt may have on its operations 
the north american free trade agreement nafta was entered into by canada  mexico and the united states and over a transition period will remove most customs duties imposed on goods traded among the three countries 
in addition  nafta will remove or limit many investment restrictions  liberalize trade in services  provide a specialized means for settlement of  and remedies for  trade disputes arising under its laws and will result in new laws and regulations to further these goals 
although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states  it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico  which could negatively affect the company s business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations  the company engages in the use of interest rate swap agreements
