general wholesale sales 
among the more significant factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures  and product pricing decisions 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales are affected by foreign exchange rates 
significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
the company s business is seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s domestic markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center around significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
these markets are a less significant portion of the company s business and  therefore  their impact is far less than that of the selling seasons in north america 
during fiscal  the company completed the sale of both the piaget and corum distribution businesses and substantially all the assets associated with these businesses 
prior to the sale  the company had been the exclusive distributor of these brands in north america 
the company completed the sale of its piaget business to vlg in february and sold its corum business to corum switzerland in january the disposition of these brands negatively impacted sales in fiscal retail sales 
the company s retail operations consist of movado boutiques and outlet stores located throughout the us the company does not have any overseas retail operations 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence domestic wholesale operations 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist season associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
luxury and premium retail price point models generally earn lower gross margins than more popular moderate price models 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower selling prices 
gross margins from the sale of watches in the movado boutiques exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns full channel margins from manufacture to point of sale to the consumer 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
manufacturing costs of the company s brands consist primarily of component costs  internal and subcontractor assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in the us  switzerland and the far east 
the company seeks to control and reduce component and subcontractor labor costs through a combination of negotiations with existing suppliers and alternative sourcing 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and the far east and minor assembly in the us through aggressive productivity improvement efforts  the company has controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program has  in the recent past  been reasonably successful in stabilizing product costs and gross margins despite exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  sales force costs and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary proportionally with overall sales levels 
retail operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rents 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  occupancy costs  seasonal part time help and shipping supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs and various other general corporate expenses 
operating expenses over the last three fiscal years reflect the effect of the implementation of the company s growth strategy 
the dominant strategies include the launch of the tommy hilfiger watch line and the movado boutique expansion 
the more significant expenses associated with this strategy include advertising and marketing expenses designed to increase market share for all of the company s watch brands  both domestically and internationally  additions to the company s sales force  salaries and rents associated with additional outlet stores and the movado boutiques  the addition of staff to support distribution  inventory management and customer service requirements to coincide with growth of the company s business  and general and administrative expenses  such as employee benefits and the development of the company s information systems infrastructure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and those significant policies are more fully described in note to mgi s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and the application of the most critical of those policies require management to make judgements based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to sales discounts and markdowns  product returns  bad debt  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from other sources  on historical experience and contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies requiring significant judgements and estimates used in the preparations of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related allowances the company recognizes its revenue upon transfer of title  or in the case of retail sales  at the time of register receipt 
the company estimates returns and sales and cash discount allowances in the same period the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
if the allowances the company calculates do not accurately reflect amounts associated with current revenue  actual revenues could be higher or lower than the level recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectable in the future 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on the company s on going credit evaluations of our customers and customer payment history and account aging 
while the actual bad debt losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates 
as of january   there were no known situations with any of the company s major customers which would indicate the customer s inability to make the required payments 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of finished goods and component inventories  held by overseas subsidiaries  are determined using average cost 
the company s management regularly reviews its sales to customers and customers sell through at retail to determine excess or obsolete inventory reserves 
inventory with less than acceptable turn rates is classified as discontinued and  together with the related component parts which can be assembled into saleable finished goods  is sold through the company s outlet stores 
when management deems finished product and components are unsalable in the company s outlet stores  a reserve is established for the cost of the product 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements depending on future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions which may differ from our expectations 
warranty all watches sold by the company are covered by limited warranties against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one to three years from the date of purchase for movements and up to five years for movado watch cases and bracelets 
the company records an estimate for future warranty costs based on historical repair costs 
warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
if such costs were to substantially exceed estimates  this could have an adverse affect on the company s operating results 
income taxes the company s estimated income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company has considered future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result  the company has determined a valuation allowance is required for foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the company will continue to monitor and assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets in the future for changes to the tax code  change in statutory tax rates and the projected level of taxable income 
other policy the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
this standard is considered to be a critical accounting policy  for further information concerning accounting policies  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal along with a discussion of the changes in financial conditions during fiscal during fiscal  caribbean net sales were reclassified from international to domestic 
prior year net sales have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
the following are net sales by product class and business segment in thousands fiscal years ended january  concord  movado  coach  esq and tommy hilfiger domestic    international    retail    other    net sales    the following table presents the company s results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated in millions fiscal years ended january  january  january  net of net of net of sales sales sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net gain on disposition of business income before taxes and cumulative effect provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales total net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was the result of the us recession and the economic conditions resulting from the tragic events surrounding september  domestic brand sales decreased by or million 
the domestic sales decline was the result of the economic uncertainty that surrounded the second half of fiscal  which resulted in our retailers delaying their purchases so that they were much closer to their selling season and their reluctance to build their inventory levels 
these sales declines were partially offset by the launch of the tommy hilfiger brand 
international brand sales increased by with increases of in the concord brand and in the movado brand 
sales in the company s retail segment increased by million or due mainly to the company opening three new outlets and three new boutiques including our flagship movado boutique in new york city 
in addition  comparable store sales increased by and in the movado boutiques and outlet stores  respectively 
at january   the company owned and operated movado boutiques  including the new york city flagship store and outlets as compared to seven movado boutiques and outlets at january  other sales  which include domestic and international service and shipping income  increased by or million due to an increase in service and shipping revenue 
gross margin gross margin decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease on gross margin reflects lower margins in our wholesale segment  which decreased due to a change in the product sales mix offset by higher margins in our retail operations due to higher margin products offered at retail 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses related to several areas  including advertising and marketing expense decrease of million or  selling expense decrease of million or  general and administrative expense decrease of million or and somewhat offset by an increase in distribution expense of million or 
the decrease in advertising expense was the result of a headcount reduction and a decrease in cooperative advertising programs offset by an increase in media expenditures and costs related to the launch of tommy hilfiger 
selling expense remained flat compared to fiscal even with an increase in spending for our growth initiatives 
during fiscal  the company opened two movado boutiques and our flagship movado boutique in new york city  three new outlet stores and costs associated with the tommy hilfiger launch 
these investments were offset by decreases in sales commissions and bonuses which declined due to decreased sales 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is the result of the company s cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in bonus expense due to the company not meeting corporate earnings targets 
these savings were partially offset by the severance accrual of million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal distribution expense reflects the costs associated with the relocation and expansion to a new state of the art distribution center  which was occupied in february these expenses include occupancy costs  security systems and depreciation 
interest expense net interest expense in fiscal decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net decrease was due to a lower average interest rate on the short term bank borrowings from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal  partially offset by an increase of the weighted average short term bank borrowings 
in addition  a million payment on the long term borrowings was made in january interest for this borrowing was reduced by approximately million 
income taxes the company s income tax provision amounted to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  or of pretax income for fiscal and of pretax income for fiscal during fiscal  the company s estimated effective annual tax rate changed from to  reflecting a decrease in the company s us source earnings as a percentage of the overall earnings mix 
the tax expense for the third quarter of fiscal was adjusted for the difference between the annual tax rate versus the tax rate used to record tax expense for the six months ended july  the company believes that the near term future effective tax rate will stabilize in the to range based on the company s current expectation that domestic earnings will gradually increase as a percentage of the overall earnings mix 
however  there can be no assurance of this result as it is dependent on a number of factors  including mix of foreign to domestic earnings  local statutory tax rates and the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in a certain jurisdiction 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales total net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic brand sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic sales were led by double digit growth in the movado brand and high single digit growth in the esq brand 
international sales of the company s brands increased led by the continuing international rollout of the coach watch brand in the far east  which resulted in a doubling of coach watch international sales in fiscal and double digit growth in the concord brand 
retail sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal retail sales increases were led by sales increases from four outlet stores open a full year in fiscal versus a part year in fiscal  three new movado boutiques opened in las vegas  nv  riverside square  nj  and boca raton  fl and comparable store sales increased in the movado boutiques 
outlet comparable store sales were relatively flat with a decrease 
at january   the company operated outlet stores and seven movado boutiques as compared to outlets and five movado boutiques at january  other sales decreased by million or due to a reduction in after sales service revenues as a result of the sale of the piaget and corum businesses 
gross margins gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal gross margin increases reflect the improvements the company initiated in fiscal these improvements included the improved availability of core range products  higher margins on new model introductions  reduction of product acquisition costs mainly due to the strength of the us dollar against the swiss franc and significant reduction of liquidation sales

the increase in advertising costs was the result of an increase of million in the movado boutiques and cooperative advertising programs offset by a decrease of expenditures for special events  point of sale support material such as displays and product brochures and media advertising programs 
increases in advertising expenses at the movado boutiques reflect the costs associated with new business initiatives 
selling expenses increased in both the company s wholesale and retail businesses 
increases in selling expenses in the wholesale business primarily reflect higher levels of sales commissions due to sales increases in the movado brands and increases in head count to support the launch of the tommy hilfiger line 
increases in selling expenses associated with the company s retail operations relate primarily to the addition of one new outlet and two new movado boutiques in fiscal as well as the annualized cost of stores opened during fiscal distribution expenses are largely variable in nature and these expenses grew proportionately with increases in unit volume shipments offset by a nonrecurring charge of million made in fiscal  for expenses related to the relocation of the company s us distribution operations 
increases in general and administrative expenses were substantially due to the recording of a management bonus as a result of exceeding corporate performance targets  a moving and relocation expense associated with the shutdown of the distribution and service center in lyndhurst  nj and costs associated with new business initiatives including staffing costs for the launch of the tommy hilfiger brand  movado boutiques and company outlet stores 
in addition  there were cost increases in a small number of general and administrative expenses which are consistent with industry cost increases 
interest expense net interest expense in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily a result of a decrease in investment income from the investment of the million proceeds from the company s sale of the piaget business in february gross interest expense decreased by million or due to a decrease in the average short term bank borrowings from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a reduction of short term bank borrowings offset by an increase in average interest rates

income taxes the company s income tax provision amounted to million and million for fiscal and  respectively  or of pretax income for fiscal and for fiscal in addition  a portion of the company s consolidated operations are located in non us jurisdictions and  therefore  the company s effective rate differs from us statutory rates

in fiscal  and the company generated from operations million  million and million  respectively  and in fiscal million was generated from the sale of the piaget business 
this positive cash flow has been a source of funds for the company s growth initiatives  including working capital  capital expenditures  the company s stock repurchase program and debt repayment 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal was less than fiscal mainly due to the timing of the receipt of inventory and the subsequent inventory payments made earlier in fiscal than fiscal  as well as the timing of tax payments and reduction of net income 
operating cash flow in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to increased inventory positions 
the company used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for investing activities  primarily for capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the company had a cash inflow of million mainly as a result of the sale of its piaget business to vlg for million in cash

market risks the company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk see note to the consolidated financial statements

the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company purchases various financial instruments  predominately forward and option contracts 
gains and losses on financial instruments resulting from this hedging activity are partially offset by the effects of the currency movements on respective underlying hedged transactions 
if the company did not engage in a hedging program  any change in the swiss franc to local currency would have an equal effect on the entities cost of sales 
as of january   the company s forward contracts hedging portfolio consisted of various dates ranging through may  the company has a million swiss francs option contract with a maturity date of october  and a million option contract with a maturity date of may  in addition  the company has certain debt obligations with variable interest rates  which are based on libor plus a fixed additional interest rate 
the company does not hedge these interest rate risks 
the company also has certain debt obligations with fixed interest rates 
the difference between the market based interest rates at january  and the fixed rates were unfavorable
