item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank and its subsidiaries and the trusts 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
management strategy management s primary goal is to enhance stockholder value  while fostering and maintaining customer confidence through a continued focus on improved earnings while managing risks  including liquidity and interest rate risk 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing core deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company will continue to emphasize production  through origination and purchase  of traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in new jersey 
the company produced million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans  which totaled billion or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  the company generally sells its conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential loan production 
sales have been periodically suspended in certain circumstances 
for example  loans were held in portfolio as part of a leverage strategy associated with the trust preferred securities offering in march and as a partial replacement of investment securities called before maturity during fiscal in addition  in fiscal the company sold approximately million of longer duration  one to four family residential mortgage loans in an effort to improve liquidity  interest rate risk and net interest margin 
total loans sold during fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the level of loan sale activity continues to be actively evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company will continue its emphasis on increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan porfolios as a percentage of total loans 
these loans generally reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   and  commercial and multi family and consumer loans represented  and  respectively  of the total gross loan portfolio 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and collection efforts and aggressive marketing of real estate owned properties 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at june  increasing core deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
the company will continue to emphasize growth in generally lower costing core deposits consisting of checking  money market and savings accounts 
the company utilizes various techniques to generate these types of deposits including special promotional rates and offerings 
core deposits increased million  or  in fiscal managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than weekly to price loan and deposit products and monthly to develop  implement and review strategies and policies to manage interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized core deposits and utilized intermediate longer term borrowings and has  at select times  emphasized longer term certificates of deposit 
furthermore  the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan products  including the focus on the production of loans with adjustable rate features and or with shorter terms to maturity 
the company has also engaged in one to four family mortgage loan sales whereby longer duration conventional loans have been sold 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company has and will continue to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
total service charges and other non interest income  excluding the net gain on sales of loans and real estate operations  reflected a  or  increase for fiscal compared to fiscal  due  in part  to growth in core deposits and earnings from the bank s investment services at penn federal program 
this program gives customers convenient access to financial consulting advisory services and related uninsured non deposit investment and insurance products at local branch offices through a non affiliated entity 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which includes ongoing reviews of staffing levels  facilities and operations 
the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a positive gap if the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a negative gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a positive gap  the yield on its rate sensitive assets would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities  thereby improving future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a positive gap would indicate that the yield on rate sensitive assets would decline at a faster pace than the cost of rate sensitive liabilities and diminish net interest income 
for an institution with a negative gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the residential lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s interest sensitive financial instruments 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year if their stated interest rates are at or above current market rates 
if the stated interest rate is below current market rates  these callable securities are assumed to be called at an estimated average life of approximately years 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes that variable rate savings account balances decay gradually over time 
based on historical information  of these balances roll off within one year  roll off in the second year  roll off in the third year  and roll off each year thereafter 
during fiscal and  the bank promoted savings for life accounts  which totaled million at june  these deposits are assumed to have an average life of approximately years 
in addition  a through june savings account was also promoted during fiscal at june   the balance in these accounts totaled million 
these deposits are assumed to have no decay through june and then roll off over the following four years 
the remainder is assumed to have an average life of years 
at june   million  or  of savings accounts are assumed to roll off after five years 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months

the company s gap position changed from june  the decline in market interest rates has resulted in the redemption of certain investment securities with callable features and has increased prepayment activity on residential mortgage loans  thereby shifting a larger portion of estimated asset cash flows to within one year 
the proceeds from such activities were used to reduce short term borrowings and fund growth in the loan portfolio 
also contributing to the change in the gap position was the maturity of fhlb of new york advances and subsequent replacement with advances that have terms in excess of three years 
furthermore  growth in core deposits and medium term certificates of deposit coupled with a decline in short term certificates of deposit  including municipal certificates of deposit  also reduced the short term estimated cash flows of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of interest rate gap analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored by management through additional interest rate risk irr measures  including an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a low initial npv ratio or high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure  was 
as of june   the company s internally generated initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was 
the duration of assets has declined principally due to increased prepayment estimates 
conversely  the duration of liabilities has extended principally due to the decline in short term fundings  both wholesale and retail  the extension of fhlb of new york advances and the growth in core deposits 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions and  as such  generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk ie  higher post shock npv ratio and lower sensitivity measure than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s unconsolidated irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the bank with the ots  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would increase from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years   and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically sold a portion of its one to four family whole mortgage loan portfolio in an effort to shorten its average life and duration  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
the level of such activity continues to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate and longer term borrowings  subject to market conditions 
the company has focused on developing and strengthening customer relationships in an effort to improve earnings and funding stability 
the company has also emphasized growth in core deposit accounts as these funds are generally lower cost alternatives  are relatively stable  have a longer duration and assist in strengthening customer relationships 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was employed to manage the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
in the first half of fiscal year  short term market rates declined rapidly while longer term market rates followed more gradually and the yield curve significantly steepened 
this shift in rates led to a significant improvement in net interest rate spread  as short term wholesale and retail funding costs were sharply reduced 
the decline in long term rates led to an increase in residential loan refinance and us government agency security redemption activities 
cash flow from these asset repayments was partially used to reduce short term wholesale funding balances 
as market rates continued to fall in the second half of the fiscal year  it became increasingly difficult to build longer term deposit relationships customers were not willing to place their funds in lower yielding  longer term certificates of deposit 
in response  the bank emphasized several core deposit account promotions  including personal and business checking  and premium savings accounts 
deposit growth through these promotions allowed the bank to avoid premium pricing on certificates of deposit and to take advantage of historically low cost  longer term wholesale borrowings 
as a result  the company s net interest rate spread continued to grow throughout the fiscal year and its sensitivity to rising interest rates was reduced 
residential mortgage loan sale activities were reestablished in late fiscal to manage interest rate risk  as fixed rate  long term loan production accelerated 
as a result of the above activity  one to four family first mortgage loan balances grew million between june  and june   adjustable rate balances fell million  despite attractive pricing of these products  while fixed rate balances increased million 
consumer loan balances increased million 
prime based home equity lines of credit fell million while other consumer products  principally fixed rate second mortgages generally with shorter durations than one to four family residential mortgages  increased million 
commercial and multi family real estate loan balances grew million during the current fiscal year with million of the growth in adjustable rate products 
at june   medium and long term certificates of deposits with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million compared to million at june  the reduction of certificates of deposit was more than offset by a million increase in core deposit balances 
checking and money market account balances grew million  while savings balances increased million 
furthermore  wholesale borrowings with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million at june   reflecting growth of million during the current fiscal year 
short term retail deposit balances with remaining maturities less than one year  including municipal deposit balances  fell million and short term wholesale funding balances fell million between june  and june  additionally  the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
the balances of savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  which represented approximately of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives
