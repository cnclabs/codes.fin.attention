net revenues and gross profit net revenues for the year ended december   totaled billion  an increase of million  or  from the million reported in the prior year 
this increase was comprised of increases of million in net revenues from north american subsidiaries  million in net revenues from latin american subsidiaries  and million in net revenues from european subsidiaries  offset by a decrease of million from other operations 
north american subsidiaries net revenues totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales volume  in part due to new product releases  including paclitaxel  and higher sales prices for certain products  partially offset by higher sales returns and allowances

european subsidiaries generated net revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and prices of respiratory products  partially offset by reduced product development fees and the effect of unfavorable exchange rates

our paclitaxel product accounted for approximately of our net revenues during the entry of two competitors for brand equivalent paclitaxel resulted in price and volume pressures during the latter part of we are continuing to experience increased competition for paclitaxel as well as our brand equivalent albuterol products and the resulting pricing and volume pressures have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our revenues and gross profits 
our future net revenues and gross profits will depend upon o our ability to maintain our pricing and volume levels and obtain a consistent supply of raw materials for paclitaxel  o our ability to maintain a pipeline of products in development  o our ability to develop and rapidly introduce new products  o the timing of regulatory approval of such products  o the number and timing of regulatory approval of competing products  o our ability to manufacture such products efficiently  and o our ability to replace or renew license fees  royalties and development service fees as the related agreements expire or are terminated

although research and development expenditures are expected to be between million and million during  actual expenditures will depend on  among other things  the outcome of clinical testing or products under development  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  strategic marketing decisions and liquidity 
in addition  we plan to spend between million and million in to improve and expand our pharmaceutical and other related facilities 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash and internally generated funds  which we believe will be sufficient to meet our operating needs and anticipated capital expenditures over the short term 
for the long term  we intend to utilize principally internally generated funds  which are anticipated to be derived primarily from the sale of existing pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical products currently under development 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete products under development  that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such products  or that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed

income taxes our effective tax rate was for  for  and for  which was lower in each of these years than the us statutory income tax rate  principally due to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax incentives in certain jurisdictions where our manufacturing facilities are located 
during  we recognized a million tax provision 
the domestic current provision was favorably impacted by million from utilization of previously reserved net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the non taxable gain on the partial sale of ivax diagnostics  inc payment of the current tax provision for the year ended december   will be reduced by million for our domestic operations and million for our foreign operations  representing the incremental impact of compensation expense deductions associated with non qualified stock option exercises during the current year

these amounts were credited to capital in excess of par value in the accompanying balance sheet 
we recognized million in and million in of us taxable income on the intercompany assignment of a contract 
for financial reporting purposes these transactions were eliminated in consolidation 
we recognized a million tax provision during of which million related to foreign operations 
we recognized a million tax provision for of which million related to foreign operations and included a valuation allowance of million recorded in the second quarter against the uk deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance previously recorded against the domestic net deferred tax asset was reversed in the amount of million in  million in  and million in  due to our expectation of increased domestic taxable income in the coming year 
our future effective tax rate will depend on the mix between foreign and domestic taxable income or losses  the statutory tax rates of the related tax jurisdictions  and the timing of the release  if any  of the domestic valuation allowance 
the mix between our foreign and domestic taxable income may be significantly affected by the jurisdiction in which new products are developed and manufactured 
at december   domestic net deferred tax assets totaled million and foreign net deferred tax assets  in countries with positive net deferred tax assets  totaled million 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future domestic and foreign taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
our estimates of future taxable income are subject to revision due to  among other things  regulatory and competitive factors affecting the pharmaceutical industries in the markets in which we operate 
we have historically received a united states tax credit under section of the internal revenue code for certain income generated by our puerto rico and virgin islands operations 
these credits were approximately million for  million for and million for and completely offset the entire united states tax liability of such operations 
the section tax credit will be phased out over four years beginning in risk of product liability claims testing  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products subjects us to the risk of product liability claims 
we are a defendant in a number of product liability cases  none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
there can be no assurance that claims arising under any pending or future product liability cases  whether or not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ivax corporation and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances revenues and the related cost of sales are recognized at the time product is shipped 
our pharmaceutical revenues are affected by the level of provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits  discounts  promotional allowances  volume rebates and chargebacks  as well as other sales allowances established by us 
the custom in the pharmaceutical industry is generally to grant customers the right to return purchased goods 
in the brand equivalent pharmaceutical industry  this custom has resulted in a practice of suppliers issuing inventory credits also known as shelf stock adjustments to customers based on the customers existing inventory following decreases in the market price of the related brand equivalent pharmaceutical product 
the determination to grant a credit to a customer following a price decrease is generally at our discretion  and generally not pursuant to contractual agreements with customers 
these credits allow customers with established inventories to compete with those buying product at the current market price  and allow us to maintain shelf space  market share and customer loyalty 
provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits and chargebacks  as well as other sales allowances  are established by us concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including actual return and inventory credit experience for products during the past several years by product type  the number and timing of regulatory approvals for the product by our competitors both historical and projected  the market for the product  expected sell through levels by our wholesaler customers to customers with contractual pricing arrangements with us  estimated customer inventory levels by product and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns and inventory credits incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including price competition and the level of customer inventories at the time of any price decreases 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and customer inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that actual product returns  inventory credits and other allowances may differ from established reserves 
royalty and license fee income are recognized when obligations associated with earning the royalty or licensing fee have been satisfied and are included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
through  our accounting policy was to immediately recognize as revenue up front and milestone cash payments that are nonrefundable or where the probability of refund is remote 
as a result of sab no 
 we revised our accounting policy to defer up front payments  whether or not they are refundable  and recognize them in income over the license period 
where we expend resources to achieve milestones  we recognize the milestone payments in income currently 
the total amortization of up front payments and current recognition of milestones is limited to nonrefundable provisions of the contract 
gain on sale of product rights royalty and milestone payments from the sale of rights to elmiron r and certain other urology products in the united states and canada to alza amounted to million in  million in  and million in  and are included in other income as additional gain on the sale of product rights 
we may receive additional royalties and milestone payments from alza based on sales of the products during the next few years 
a portion of the up front and milestone payments received and included in other income in prior years  million as of december   is refundable through december   and then ratably decreases through  if the patent rights are found to be invalid and a brand equivalent of elmiron r is introduced by another company 
we believe the probability of occurrence of these events is remote 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may require revision or that the remaining net book value may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset may be impaired  we use various methods to estimate the asset s future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset 
any impairment amount is charged to operations 
sale of subsidiary stock during  ivax elected income statement recognition as its accounting policy for sales of subsidiary stock and recorded a gain of million  related to merger of ivax diagnostics  inc  with bbstores 
com  which is included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
legal costs legal charges are recorded for the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
we intend to vigorously defend each of the lawsuits described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  but their respective outcomes cannot be predicted 
any of such lawsuits  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our ultimate liability with respect to any of the foregoing proceedings is not presently determinable 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which involve substantial amounts 
in order to obtain brand equivalent approvals prior to the expiration of patents on branded products  and to benefit from the exclusivity allowed to abbreviated new drug application applicants that successfully challenge these patents  we frequently become involved in patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical companies 
although these lawsuits involve products that are not yet marketed and therefore pose little or no risk of liability for damages  the legal fees and costs incurred in defending such litigation can be substantial 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome or the total cost of these proceedings  in our opinion  based on a review with legal counsel  any losses resulting from such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have subsidiaries in more than countries worldwide 
in  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of worldwide sales 
virtually all of these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country 
as such  our reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates 
if the united states dollar weakens relative to the foreign currency  the earnings generated in the foreign currency will  in effect  increase when converted into united states dollars and vice versa 
although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we do from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
as a result of exchange rate differences  net revenues decreased by million in compared to and decreased by million in compared to the effects of inflation on consolidated net revenues and operating income were not significant 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which primarily consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated primarily to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
as of december   we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  of which million related to us dollar debt of million of our argentine based subsidiary  armstrong 
subsequent to december   the argentine peso and venezuelan bolivar devalued in relation to the united states dollar 
the operating results in these currencies will decrease when converted into united states dollars 
during january  we repaid million of united states dollar denominated bank loans of the argentine operations assumed in the acquisition of lab chile resulting in a pretax loss of approximately million 
interest rate risk our only material debt obligations relate to the and convertible notes  which bear fixed rates of interest  and million of bank debt assumed in the acquisition of lab chile which was repaid in january we believe that our exposure to market risk relating to interest rate risk is not material
