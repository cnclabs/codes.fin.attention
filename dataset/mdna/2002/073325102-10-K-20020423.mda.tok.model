item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bea is the world s leading application infrastructure software provider 
bea s weblogic enterprise platform delivers a highly reliable  scalable software infrastructure for customers to bring new services to market quickly  to lower operational costs by automating processes  and to automate relationships with suppliers and distributors 
our products are marketed and sold worldwide primarily through our direct sales force  and also through systems integrators sis  independent software vendors isvs and hardware vendors that are our allies and distributors 
our products have been adopted in a wide variety of industries  including telecommunications  commercial and investment banking  securities trading  software  airlines  services  retail  manufacturing  package delivery  insurance and government 
the bea weblogic platform provides application infrastructure for building an integrated e business  allowing customers to integrate private client server networks  the internet  intranets  extranets  and mainframe and legacy systems as system components 
our products serve as a platform  integration tool or portal framework for applications such as billing  provisioning  customer service  electronic funds transfers  atm networks  securities trading  web based banking  internet sales  supply chain management  scheduling and logistics  and hotel  airline and rental car reservations 
licenses for our products are typically priced on a per central processing unit basis  but we also offer licenses priced on a per user basis 
seasonality 
as is common in the software industry  we believe that our fourth quarter orders have in the past been favorably impacted by a variety of factors  including year end capital purchases by larger corporate customers and the commission structure for our sales force 
this increase typically results in first quarter orders being lower than orders received in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our first quarter is likely to continue 
investment in distribution channels 
in august  we announced a major planned investment in expansion of our indirect distribution network through stronger relationships with sis  isvs  application service providers  original equipment manufacturers  and distributors 
the goals of this program are to increase the revenue contribution from indirect sources from approximately percent prior to the program to approximately percent in fiscal  and to increase the number of projects we can address by increasing the pool of consultants available to assist customers with application development and deployment 
in fiscal  approximately percent of our revenue was influenced by indirect sources  which is within our expected progress toward our goal 
at inception of the program  we estimated that approximately  independent consultants had been trained on bea software 
as of january   we estimate that a total of approximately  consultants had been trained on our software 
although results of our investment in indirect distribution channels to date have met our goals  there can be no assurance that sis  isvs and other third parties will continue to use or recommend our products 
investment in developer programs 
our products are a platform for java application development  both packaged applications built and sold by isvs and custom applications built by our customers and si partners 
success in a platform market requires that a large number of developers are trained on and actively using our platform 
as a result  we have made a substantial investment in building programs to attract and retain java developers 
in addition  bea weblogic workshop  which is currently in beta  is designed to allow developers who are not trained in java  such as developers who primarily use visual basic  power builder or cobol  to quickly and easily become productive in java and on weblogic server 
as a result  we are investing in programs to go beyond the community of java developers and attract developers currently using non java platforms 
there can be no assurance that our investment in these programs will be successful 
acquisitions 
throughout our history  we have acquired product lines  development teams  distributors and companies to expand our business 
our strategy is to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
primarily  our acquisition strategy focuses on using cash or stock to purchase small development teams that we believe can build features or products that complement or expand our products 
although our strategy is to avoid acquisitions of large companies  measured in purchase price  revenue or number of employees  there can be no assurance that we will not acquire a large company 
for large or small acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will not be dilutive to earnings  will be successfully integrated into our company  or that product development will be completed and integrated successfully 
in addition  the price paid for any acquisition is subject to negotiation between the parties  and the valuation of potential acquisition targets is not an exact science 
as a result  there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be done at a correct valuation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgements that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  including those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  investments in equity securities  facilities consolidation charges  and intangible assets 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed below and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
we do not record revenue on sales to customers whose ability to pay is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these customers as cash is collected 
the determination of a customer s ability to pay requires significant judgment 
revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and  accordingly  we do not generally recognize revenue on the majority of these arrangements until the customer payment becomes due 
the determination of whether extended payment terms are fixed or determinable requires significant judgement by management  including assessing such factors as the past payment history with the individual customer and evaluating the risk of concessions over an extended payment period 
the determinations that we make can materially impact the timing of recognition of revenues 
we recognize revenue on sales to resellers on a sell through basis  that is  when persuasive evidence is obtained by us that the reseller has sold the products to an end user customer 
revenue from sales to independent software vendors isvs who embed our products into their software products are recognized either upon delivery to the isv or on a sell through basis  depending on the facts and circumstances of the transaction  such as our understanding of the isv s use of our software  the isv s financial status and our past experience with the particular customer 
accordingly the decision whether to recognize revenue to isv s either upon delivery or on a sell through basis requires significant management judgement 
this judgement can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgement 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at january  income taxes 
realization of bea s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which is uncertain in part due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income at january  and has been established to reflect these uncertainties 
as of january   the unrecognized deferred tax assets are primarily attributable to accumulated stock option tax deduction benefits 
accordingly  in the event that bea was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
investments in equity securities 
we hold minority investments in privately held technology companies 
these companies face significant operational and financial risks typical of many companies in the high technology marketplace 
we record investment impairment charges whenever the value of an individual investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
determination of the timing and size of any impairment charge requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the future operating results of the investee companies  including estimates of future revenues expected to be generated by the investee companies  and the ability of the investees to access capital as may be necessary to fund their ongoing operations until the point at which these investees can generate working capital from their own operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or deteriorating operating results of the investee companies may require additional impairment charges in the future  resulting in losses and further reductions in carrying values 
we account for all of our current equity investments using the cost method because our ownership is less than percent and we have determined that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  investing and financing decisions of the investee companies 
under the cost method  we do not record our pro rata share of the investee company s losses but rather we record the initial investment at cost and periodically review the investment for impairment 
significant judgement is required to determine whether or not we have the ability to exercise significant influence  which could have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
if it were determined we had the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee we would have to record our pro rata share of losses or income of the investee as incurred 
facilities consolidation charges 
during the quarter ended october   we recorded a charge for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities consolidation charge  we were required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties  sublease rates and the willingness of landlords to negotiate termination fees 
these estimates will be reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis and to the extent that future vacancy rates and sublease rates vary adversely from those estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in the accrued facilities consolidation charge at january  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
such reversals would be reflected as a credit to facilities consolidation charges 
intangible assets 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as purchased technology and non compete agreements are amortized to operating expense over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of february  are not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques  which are based on estimated future operating results 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
in fiscal  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and  as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill  which includes the reclassification of approximately million of assembled workforce to goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
there can be no assurance that at the time that the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be required and recorded 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods

the growth from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal reflects significant increases in sales of our weblogic products and growth in our customer support revenues 
in addition  the growth from fiscal to fiscal was driven in part by an increase in consulting and education revenues  which increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal consulting and education revenues decreased to million in fiscal  which partially offset the growth in license and customer support revenues  resulting in an overall revenue growth rate of percent over fiscal our revenue growth rate has been effected by multiple factors during fiscal  and  including growth in the application server market  level of acceptance of our products in the market  competition  general economic conditions and changes in overall information technology it spending on a world wide basis 
while many factors have impacted our growth  the economic downturn during fiscal and reductions in it spending contributed significantly to the reduction in our year over year growth rate  which decreased from percent for fiscal to percent in fiscal many factors that impact our growth are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will continue to grow in the future

the increase from fiscal to fiscal in total service revenues was mainly attributable to the growth in customer support revenues  which was driven by maintenance renewals on our existing installed base of software licenses as well as new maintenance contracts sold together with our increased sales of software licenses 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  as we continued to execute our strategy of focusing on having strategic partners provide consulting services related to the deployment and use of our software products  which began to impact our consulting and education revenues in late fiscal and through fiscal as a result of the increased focus on strategic partners as well as the economic slowdown and general reductions in it spending on a worldwide basis  we experienced a significant decrease in our lower margin consulting and education revenues in fiscal service revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  as our service business experienced strong growth in consulting and education revenues

the decrease from fiscal to fiscal in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to decreases in our lower margin consulting and education revenues 
a decrease in amortization charges included in cost of revenues also contributed to the decrease in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
these decreases were offset by additional expenses from the impairment of acquired intangible assets and severance costs in fiscal the increase in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in service revenues  which carry a substantially higher cost of revenues than software licenses 
amortization charges included in cost of revenues also contributed to the increase from fiscal to fiscal cost of licenses

acquisition related charges 
in connection with the acquisition of the workflow automation corporation in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired and expensed the cost of a number of research projects that were in process on the acquisition date  which amounted to million 
in fiscal  acquisition related charges of million were recorded in connection with the write off of acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of the theory center 
other charges facilities consolidation and severance charges 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we approved a plan to consolidate certain facilities in regions including the united states  canada  and germany 
a facilities consolidation charge of million was calculated using management s best estimates and was based upon the remaining future lease commitments and brokerage fees for vacant facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the facilities consolidation charge also includes the write off of million of leasehold improvements 
the estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease  were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from independent real estate industry sources 
as of january   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income  remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal in calculating this charge  certain assumptions were made relating to such factors as the estimated time periods of vacancy and sublease rates and opportunities 
if actual circumstances prove to be materially different than management has estimated  our total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the scope and re evaluated the timing of the planned construction of facilities at our san jose  california headquarters  resulting in an additional facilities related charge of million 
adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent and  accordingly  we recorded total severance charges of million  of which million was paid in fiscal and million remains accrued at january  the balance of accrued severance charges is expected to be fully paid by january  the employee reductions were across all business functions  operating units and major geographic regions 
severance charges included severance benefits  notice pay and out placement counseling services

in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill  million of which was a write down of certain acquired intangible assets that is included in cost of revenues and million of which was a write down of goodwill that is included in operating expenses 
the acquired intangible assets and goodwill that were impaired primarily originated from the acquisitions of the theory center acquired in november and bauhaus technologies  inc bauhaus acquired in october during the third quarter of fiscal  we observed indicators that the acquired intangible assets and goodwill from the theory center and bauhaus were possibly impaired and  accordingly  performed an assessment for impairment under fas with respect to the theory center  we made product and strategic changes during the third quarter that significantly decreased the importance and value of the technology acquired from the theory center  including the decision to discontinue the use of certain technology acquired from the theory center 
with respect to bauhaus  we observed a significant downturn in our consulting business during the third quarter of fiscal  and in particular the consulting business of bauhaus  which indicated possible impairment 
with the assistance of independent valuation experts  we performed asset impairment tests at the lowest operational level that had separately identifiable cash flows related to the theory center and bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows over a month period for the theory center and a month period for bauhaus to the carrying amount of the long lived assets resulting from the acquisitions 
the conclusion of these tests was that the decline in value of the theory center and bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill was significant and other than temporary 
the impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of such assets exceeded their fair value 
measurement of fair value was based on analyses of the discounted future cash flows at the theory center and bauhaus level 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including assumptions and projections of future operating results that we consider to be both reasonable and supportable 
the discount rates used in the analyses were percent for the theory center and percent for bauhaus  which were based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which the theory center and bauhaus operated 
the analyses indicated that the intangible assets and goodwill for the theory center were impaired by an amount totaling million and for bauhaus by an amount totaling million 
in addition  an impairment charge of million was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal  which related to the write off of goodwill associated with a small foreign sales operation that was disposed of 
the total impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal is summarized as follows in millions the theory center bauhaus other we did not record any write downs of long lived assets in fiscal or interest income expense and other  net the following table provides a summary of the items included in interest income expense and other  net in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal percentage change fiscal vs

in addition  we recorded a net gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the sale of one of our minority investments to an unrelated third party 
these gains were offset by write downs of equity investments in privately held companies of million and million in fiscal and  respectively

accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses from prior years  we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent that they are dependent upon future taxable income for realization

additionally  there are no cash lease payments reflected in the above schedule until the first quarter of fiscal furthermore  the minimum lease payments shown above are based on the variable london interbank offering rate libor 
actual payments will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in libor 
in the future  we may lengthen the land lease  have additional improvements built on the land  purchase the land under our purchase option  or arrange to sell the land  or parcels of the land 
if the company determines to not pursue  completely or in part  the construction of additional corporate offices  this could result in a material charge to earnings 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the land lease

the cash is restricted as to withdrawal and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations 
we have classified this amount as a long term restricted asset on our consolidated balance sheet at january  we also must maintain certain covenants  including liquidity  leverage and profitability ratios 
as of january  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in the event of a default  the lessor may demand payment equal to the lessor s outstanding lease balance  require us to purchase the land  facilitate the sale of the property or surrender the property 
if we chose to purchase the land  this could materially decrease our cash available for working capital  could make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain  and would require us to capitalize the land on our balance sheet 
no bea officers or employees have any financial interest with regards to the land lease arrangement 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through january  however  we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund any such acquisitions or licenses 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us

effect of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb released statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
these statements become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning february   goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
most other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the new rules also required business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and goodwill acquired after june  will not be amortized 
goodwill existing at june  continued to be amortized through the end of the fiscal year ended january  in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under fas  we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of the date of adoption february  to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  then we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with fas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption of fas on february   we have an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately million  excluding the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill  and an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million  which includes the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill of approximately million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of fas and transitional impairment losses that may be required to be recognized upon the adoption of fas and are indeterminable at this time 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fas beginning on february  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
we have evaluated the impact of eitf no 
and believe its adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued an announcement on the topic of income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred the announcement 
the announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the income statement 
the announcement should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
we will adopt the announcement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal historically  we have netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the announcement will have no impact on our gross margin or net income loss but will increase our services revenue and cost of services revenue 
on february   the fasb met and discussed changes to their consolidations project that could substantially change the accounting for leases 
the fasb plans to allow the public to comment on an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 consolidated financial statements  which will include proposed changes which may affect the accounting for leases 
the fasb plans to issue a draft by april  and to finalize the statement by july  the fasb intends to issue the final statement with an effective date being the first day of the first fiscal year beginning after december  february  for bea 
it is possible that interpretive changes may require that assets associated with our lease for additional corporate offices in san jose  california would be treated as if we had purchased the assets 
the treatment would result in an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately million 
our restricted cash  currently held as collateral  could be returned to the company as cash or used to offset the purchase price of the land 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in our actual or anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results may prevent us from meeting securities analysts or investors expectations and may result in a decline in our stock price although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent years  this growth rate has declined substantially in recent quarters 
for example  in the quarter ended october   our revenues declined as compared to previous the quarter  and in the quarter ended january  our revenues declined as compared the same quarterly period in the prior year 
in addition  in our second quarter earnings release in august and again in our third quarter earnings announcement in november  we revised downward our financial guidance for revenue and earnings for the remainder of fiscal if our revenues  operating results  earnings or future projections are below the levels expected by investors or securities analysts  our stock price is likely to decline 
our stock price is also subject to the volatility generally associated with internet  software and technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance  such as the declines in the prices of many such stocks from march through the present 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future quarterly revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including ongoing adverse economic conditions  particularly within the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties arising out of recent and possible future terrorist activities and related military and security actions  which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce the size of orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls  difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders  particularly as a greater percentage of our revenues has shifted from service revenues to license revenues  changes in our competitors product offerings and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from us or our competitors  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly in the face of current adverse economic conditions and increased competition  introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products  our ability to control costs and expenses  particularly in the face of current adverse economic conditions which may adversely impact our operating results  changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or the channels through which they are distributed  the degree of success  if any  of our strategy to further establish and expand our relationships with distributors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis and whether any new products are accepted in the market  any slowdown in use of the internet for business or commerce  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  the terms and timing of financing activities  potential fluctuations in demand or prices of our products and services  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  technological changes in computer systems and environments  our ability to successfully expand our sales and marketing programs  our ability to meet our customers service requirements  costs associated with acquisitions  including expenses charged for any impaired acquired intangible assets and goodwill  loss of key personnel  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of all of these factors  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of trends or future performance 
a material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
we have also recently been increasing our focus on these larger orders 
increases in the dollar size of some individual license transactions would also increase the risk of fluctuation in future quarterly results 
the majority of our revenue originates from a large number of small orders with the potential to turn into large deployments 
if we cannot generate large customer orders  turn development orders into large deployments or if customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  it may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  more significantly on a percentage basis  our net income or loss in that quarter 
moreover  we typically receive and fulfill most of our orders within the quarter  with the substantial majority of our orders typically received in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  after it is too late to adjust expenses for that quarter 
moreover  ongoing adverse economic conditions worldwide  particularly those related to the technology industry and the economic and political uncertainties arising out of recent and possible future terrorist activities and related military and security actions  have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls 
this risk is particularly relevant with respect to large customer orders  which are more likely to be cancelled  delayed or reduced and also have a greater financial impact on our operating results 
a number of technology companies  particularly software companies that  including us  sell enterprise wide software solutions  have announced in recent quarters that these conditions have adversely affected their financial results 
additionally  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
any revenue shortfall below our expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not effectively compete with new and existing competitors  our revenues and operating margins will decline the market for application server and integration software  and related software components and services  is highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
these competitors include operating system vendors such as ibm  sun microsystems and hewlett packard and database vendors such as oracle 
in addition  microsoft has released products that include some application server functionality and has announced that it intends to include application server and integration functionality in future versions of its operating systems 
in addition  certain application vendors  integration vendors and other companies are developing or offering application server  integration and portal software products and related services that directly compete with products that we offer 
further  software development tool vendors typically emphasize the broad versatility of their tool sets and  in some cases  offer complementary software that supports these tools and performs basic application server and integration functions 
finally  internal development groups within prospective customers organizations may develop software and hardware systems that may substitute for those we offer 
a number of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we 
some of our principal competitors currently are also hardware vendors who bundle their own application server and integration software products  or similar products  with their computer systems and database vendors that advocate client server networks driven by the database server 
ibm  sun microsystems and hewlett packard are the primary hardware vendors who offer a line of application server and integration solutions for their customers 
ibm s sale of application server and integration functionality along with its proprietary hardware systems requires us to compete with ibm in its installed base  where ibm has certain inherent advantages due to its significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and the integration of its enterprise application server and integration functionality with its proprietary hardware and database systems 
these inherent advantages allow ibm to bundle  at a discounted price  application functionality with computer hardware  software and related service sales 
due to these factors  if we do not sufficiently differentiate our products based on functionality  interoperability with non ibm systems  performance  total cost of ownership  return on investment and reliability  and establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs  our revenues and operating results will suffer 
microsoft has announced that it intends to include certain application server and integration functionality in its 
net initiative 
microsoft s 
net initiative is a proprietary programming environment that competes with the java based environment of our products 
a widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net initiative  particularly among the large and mid sized enterprises from which most of our revenues are generated  could curtail the use of java and therefore adversely impact the sales of our products 
the 
net initiative and the bundling of competing functionality in versions of windows requires us to compete with microsoft  which has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  its greater name recognition  very large developer community  its substantial installed base and the integration of its broad product line and features into a web services environment 
we need to differentiate our products from microsoft s based on scalability  functionality  interoperability with non microsoft platforms  performance  total cost of ownership  return on investment and reliability  and need to establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs 
we may not be able to successfully or sufficiently differentiate our products from those offered by microsoft  and microsoft s entry into the application server  integration and web services markets or their proposed 
net alternative to java could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of their current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell additional software licenses and maintenance  consulting and support services on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent and possible future terrorist activities and related military and security operations could adversely affect our revenues and operations as a result of the recent terrorist activities and related military and security operations  economic activity throughout the united states and much of the world was substantially disrupted 
this significantly adversely impacted our operations and our ability to generate revenues 
any future terrorist activities or any continued military or security operations involving the us could have a similar or worse effect on our operating results  particularly if such attacks or operations occur in the last month or weeks of our fiscal quarter or are significant enough to further weaken the us or global economy 
in particular  such activities and operations could result in reductions in information technology spending  and deferrals  reductions or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services 
the seasonality of our sales typically adversely affects our revenues in our first fiscal quarter as is common in the software industry  we believe that our fourth quarter orders have in the past been favorably impacted by a variety of factors  including year end capital purchases by larger corporate customers and the commission structure for our sales force 
this increase typically results in first quarter customer orders being lower than orders received in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our first quarter is likely to continue 
our revenues are derived primarily from a single group of similar and related products and related services  and a decline in demand or prices for these products or services could substantially adversely affect our operating results we currently derive the majority of our license and service revenues from bea weblogic server  bea tuxedo and from related products and services 
we expect these products and services to continue to account for the majority of our revenues in the immediate future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for bea weblogic  bea tuxedo or related services  such as a continued or worsened general economic slowdown  future terrorist activities or military actions  competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
as we have increased our focus on using strategic partners to provide services related to the deployment and use of our software solutions  we have experienced a slowdown in the growth rate of our services revenue  particularly revenue derived from our consulting services 
this trend may continue  particularly if the recent industry wide oversupply in software infrastructure consultants further increases the willingness and ability of our strategic partners to provide such services or if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens 
if this trend reverses  it may adversely affect our overall operating margins since our services revenue margins are lower than our product revenue margins 
in addition  as we introduce new versions of our two main products  such as weblogic server and bea tuxedo  any delay or failure of these new versions to gain market acceptance among new and existing customers would have an adverse affect on our revenues and other operating results 
in addition  we have recently introduced our weblogic workshop tools product and related developer initiatives to help broaden the base of developers who can utilize our technologies and products 
if weblogic workshop and these related initiatives are not successful  or less successful than we anticipate  it will have an adverse impact on our sales of bea weblogic products  the principal driver of our revenue  and related products and services  as well as adversely affect our profit margins 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue and profits although we use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in larger license transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and  in certain situations  may require us to defer recognition of revenue on the license 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we adopted the provisions of sab in our fourth fiscal quarter of additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue and profits 
moreover  policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  accounting for acquisitions  our lease for additional corporate offices in san jose  california  investments in equity securities  income taxes  facilities consolidation  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators  such as revenue recognition and our lease for additional corporate offices in san jose  california 
these standard setters and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result material and potentially adverse  changes to our accounting policies 
any failure to maintain ongoing sales through distribution channels could result in lower revenues to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as computer hardware companies  packaged application software developers  independent software vendors isvs  systems integrators sis and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors and distributors 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in expanding our direct sales force and in further establishing and expanding relationships with distributors  isvs  original equipment manufacturers oems and sis 
in particular  in august  we announced a significant initiative to further establish and expand relationships with our distributors through these sales channels  especially isvs and sis 
a significant part of this initiative is to recruit and train a large number of consultants employed by sis and induce these sis to more broadly use our products in their consulting practices  as well as to embed our technology in products that our isv customers offer 
we intend to continue this initiative and to seek distribution arrangements with additional isvs to embed our weblogic server and other products in their products 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels  secure agreements with additional sis and isvs on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and otherwise adequately continue to develop and maintain our relationships with indirect sales channels 
moreover  even if we succeed in these endeavors  it still may not increase our revenues 
in particular  we need to carefully monitor the development and scope of our indirect sales channels and create appropriate pricing  sales force compensation and other distribution parameters to help ensure these indirect channels do not conflict with or curtail our direct sales 
if we invest resources in these types of expansion and our overall revenues do not correspondingly increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we already rely on formal and informal relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to implementation and support of our products as well as lead generation and assistance in the sales process 
we will need to expand our relationships with third parties in order to support license revenue growth 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our principal competitors 
it is possible that these and other third parties will not provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers  that we will not be able to maintain an effective  long term relationship with these third parties  and that these third parties will not successfully meet the needs of our customers 
it is difficult to predict our future results for a variety of reasons including our limited operating history and need to continue to integrate our acquisitions we were incorporated in january and therefore have a relatively limited operating history 
we have generated revenues to date primarily from sales of bea weblogic  a software product which we acquired in september  and from bea tuxedo  a software product to which we acquired worldwide distribution rights in february  and fees for software products and services related to weblogic and tuxedo 
we have also acquired a number of additional technologies  products and businesses 
our limited operating history and the need to continue to integrate a number of separate and independent business operations subject our business to numerous risks 
at january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in addition  in connection with acquisitions completed prior to january   we recorded approximately million as intangible assets and goodwill of which approximately million has been amortized or written off as of january  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
if we acquire additional businesses  products and technologies in the future  we may report additional  potentially significant expenses  particularly in light of recent changes in regulations governing how we account for such transactions 
see below if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase 
if future events cause the impairment of any intangible assets acquired in our past or future acquisitions  we may have to record additional charges relating to such assets sooner than we expect 
moreover  we implemented a planned consolidation of various facilities and a planned reduction in work force of approximately percent in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ended january  and took charges of million and million  respectively  related to these actions 
although we first reported a net income under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended july   we reported a net loss under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended october  and january   due in part to the asset impairment charges discussed above 
because of our limited operating history and ongoing expenses associated with our prior acquisitions  the possibility of future impairment charges and charges related to any future facilities consolidations or work force reductions  we may again experience net losses in future periods 
if we are required to remit significant payroll taxes it will have an adverse impact on our future financial results when our employees exercise certain stock options  we are subject to employer payroll taxes on the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
these payroll taxes are determined by the tax rates in effect in the employee s taxing jurisdiction and are treated as an expense in the period in which the exercise occurs 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material 
however  because we are unable to predict our stock price  the number of exercises  or the country of exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict the amount  if any  of employer payroll expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including developments in the internet  changes in the software or technology industry  general market conditions  further terrorist activities and related military actions  and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or our competitors operating performance 
in addition  stock prices for bea and many other companies in the internet  technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations including recent rapid rises and declines in their stock prices that often have not been directly related to the operating performance of such companies  such as the declines in the stock prices of many such companies from march through the present 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if we do not develop and enhance new and existing products to keep pace with technological  market and industry changes  our revenues may decline the market for our products is highly fragmented  competitive with alternative computing architectures  and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving and competing industry standards  and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to timely and effectively enhance existing products such as our weblogic server products and web services features  respond to changing customer requirements  and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products such as our weblogic portal  weblogic integration and weblogic workshop products that keep pace with technological and market developments and emerging industry standards 
it is possible that our products will not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace and that we will not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our existing products or products incorporating new technology on a timely basis 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or lack of customer acceptance of our products  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our success is increasingly dependent on our strategic partners ability to successfully develop and integrate their software with the bea products with which it interoperates or is bundled  integrated or marketed 
if their software performs poorly  contains errors or defects or is otherwise unreliable  or does not provide the features and benefits expected or required  it could lower the demand for our solutions  result in negative publicity or loss of reputation regarding us and our products and services and adversely affect our revenues and other operating results 
if the market for application servers  application integration and application component software and web services does not grow as quickly as we expect  our revenues will be harmed we sell our products and services in the application server  application integration and application component markets 
these markets are emerging and are characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our success is dependent in large part on acceptance of our products by large customers with substantial legacy mainframe systems  customers establishing or building out their presence on the web for commerce  and developers of web based commerce applications 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the use of the web to run software applications and continued growth in the number of companies extending their mainframe based  mission critical applications to an enterprise wide distributed computing environment and to the internet through the use of application server and integration technology 
there can be no assurance that the markets for application server and integration technology and related services will continue to grow 
even if they do grow they may grow more slowly than we anticipate  particularly in view of the recent economic downturn affecting the technology sector in the united states 
if these markets fail to grow or grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
third parties could assert that our software products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to increased costs and litigation it is possible that third parties  including competitors or our technology partners  could claim our current or future products  whether developed internally or acquired  infringe their rights  including their trade secret  copyright and patent rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could cause costly litigation that could absorb significant management time  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these types of claims could cause us to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts  cease offering any subject technology or products altogether  require us to enter into royalty or license agreements and damage our ability to sell products due to any uncertainty generated as to intellectual property ownership 
if required  we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition  particularly if we are unable to ship key products 
if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase from our inception in january  we have made a substantial number of strategic acquisitions 
integration of acquired companies  divisions and products involves the assimilation of potentially conflicting operations and products  which divert the attention of our management team and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future quarters 
it is possible that we may not achieve any of the intended financial or strategic benefits of these transactions 
while we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future  there may not be suitable companies  divisions or products available for acquisition 
our acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the risk that we will not successfully assimilate the acquired operations and products  or retain key employees of the acquired operations 
there are also risks relating to the diversion of our management s attention  and difficulties and uncertainties in our ability to maintain the key business relationships that the acquired entities have established 
in addition  if we undertake future acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur additional debt obligations  incur large one time expenses  and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future amortization expense 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb eliminated pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions 
the effect of this change could be to increase the portion of the purchase price for any future acquisitions that must be charged to bea s cost of revenues and operating expenses in the periods following any such acquisitions 
as a consequence  our results of operations in periods following any such acquisition could be materially adversely affected 
although these changes will not directly affect the purchase price for any of these acquisitions  they will have the effect of increasing the reported expenses associated with any of these acquisitions 
to that extent  these changes may make it more difficult for us to acquire other companies  product lines or technologies 
also on june   the fasb pronounced under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas that purchased goodwill should not be amortized  but rather  it should be periodically reviewed for impairment 
such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control 
the fasb has further determined that at the time goodwill is considered impaired an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the timing of such an impairment if any of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict 
our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to determine whether goodwill and any assets acquired in past acquisitions have been impaired in accordance with fas and  if so  charge such impairment as an expense 
in the quarter ended october   we took an asset impairment charge of million related to past acquisitions 
we have remaining net goodwill and net acquired intangible assets of approximately million at january   so if we are required to take such additional impairment charges  the amounts could be material to our results of operations 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products makes our revenues susceptible to substantial fluctuations our customers typically use our products to implement large  sophisticated applications that are critical to their business  and their purchases are often part of their implementation of a distributed or web based computing environment 
customers evaluating our software products face complex decisions regarding alternative approaches to the integration of enterprise applications  competitive product offerings  rapidly changing software technologies and standards and limited internal resources due to other information systems requirements 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and is subject to delays or cancellation over which we have little or no control 
we have recently experienced an increase in the number of million and multi million dollar license transactions 
in some cases  this has resulted in more extended customer evaluation and procurement processes  which in turn have lengthened the overall sales cycle for our products 
the recent economic downturn has also contributed to increasing the length of our sales cycle  and there is a risk this will continue or worsen 
this delay or failure to complete large orders and sales in a particular quarter could significantly reduce revenue that quarter  as well as subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may use our technology and trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in particular  we have  in the past  provided certain hardware oems with access to our source code  and any unauthorized publication or proliferation of this source code could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our products  and although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights that we hold 
our international operations expose us to greater management  collections  currency  intellectual property  tax  regulatory and other risks international revenues accounted for percent  percent and percent of our consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we sell our products and services through a network of branches and subsidiaries located in countries worldwide 
in addition  we also market through distributors 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  greater difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulties in maintaining us accounting standards  longer collection cycles  seasonality  potential changes in tax laws  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
in particular  bea is periodically subject to tax audits by government agencies in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  the outcomes of these audits have not had a material impact on the company 
it is possible  however  that future audits could result in significant assessments for transfer taxes  payroll taxes or other taxes which could adversely effect our operating results 
general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets may also impact our international revenues 
there can be no assurances that these factors and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues and consequently on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to manage growth  our business will suffer we have experienced substantial growth that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
our recent workforce reduction announced in november has also impacted this strain 
overall  we have increased the number of our employees from employees in three offices in the united states at january  to over employees in offices in countries at january  our ability to manage our staff and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and information technology infrastructure 
in this regard  we are currently updating our management information systems to integrate financial and other reporting among our multiple domestic and foreign offices 
in addition  we may continue to increase our staff worldwide and to continue to improve the financial reporting and controls for our global operations 
we are also continuing to develop and roll out information technology initiatives 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information  control systems and information technology infrastructure in an efficient or timely manner and that  during the course of this implementation  we could discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls  as well as past errors resulting therefrom 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we have a real estate leasing structure  which could result in substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations  a substantial increase in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and substantial cash payments in connection with a lease transaction for real estate in san jose  california that we entered into the first quarter of fiscal for the construction of additional corporate offices  we have restricted approximately million out of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of january   as collateral for specified obligations to the lessor under the lease 
the investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party subject to a number of limitations 
we currently anticipate that  commencing in fiscal  we will be required under this real estate transaction to make annual lease payments of approximately million  which will fluctuate from time to time depending on short term interest rates 
during our quarter ended january  we re evaluated the scope and timing of our construction for additional corporate offices  which resulted in our recognizing a charge of million 
in addition  we began recognizing rent expense of approximately million per quarter 
if we determine to not pursue  completely or in part  the construction  we may be required to recognize a material charge to earnings 
under the land lease agreement a third party lessor agreed to finance up to million of land and associated costs 
the land lease has an initial term of five years and we have an option to renew the lease agreement  to purchase the land at any time during the lease for the outstanding lease balance or to arrange for the sale of the land to a third party 
if we elect to arrange for the sale of the land  we are obligated to pay any shortfall between the sales price and the outstanding lease balance  under a residual value guarantee 
this payment could materially decrease our cash available for working capital and make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain 
if it became probable that the value of the leased land would be less than the outstanding lease balance at lease termination  the estimated deficiency would be expensed over the remaining term of the lease which expires in however  management will continue to assess the fair value of the land to assess whether it is probable that a liability will be incurred under the residual value guarantee 
this type of assessment is highly subjective and involves a detailed understanding of such factors as the current real estate market conditions as well as future expectations for the market 
due to historical and expected volatility of the real estate market  there may be a time at which management is unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of the property at the end of the lease term or management determines that the fair value is less than the outstanding lease balance 
accordingly  we may be required to record a liability under our residual value guarantee related to the land lease at a future date  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we chose to purchase the land  for any reason  this could materially decrease our cash available for working capital  could make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain  and would require us to capitalize the land on our balance sheet 
in addition  a regulatory body governing the way in which we account for this lease  the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently in the process of formulating an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  and accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  which relates to the accounting for these types of leases 
a draft interpretive release is currently scheduled to be released in april  with finalization scheduled by july and effectiveness by december  it is possible that interpretive changes may require that assets associated with our lease for additional corporate offices in san jose  california would be treated as if we had purchased the assets 
the treatment would result in an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately million 
our restricted cash  currently held as collateral  could be returned to the company as cash or used to offset the purchase price of the land 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have a high debt balance and large interest obligations  which constrict our liquidity and could result in future substantial expenses and adverse cash outflows at january   we had approximately million of convertible notes outstanding 
as a result of this indebtedness  we have substantial principal and interest payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could significantly harm our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the convertible notes  payment of the principal amount of the convertible notes  payment of principal and interest on our other indebtedness  the lease payments discussed above  future capital expenditures  payments on our lease and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified personnel  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase revenue we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel including our founders  alfred s 
chuang and william t 
coleman iii  and other key members of management 
competition for these types of employees is intense  and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our key employees and that we will not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified candidates in the future 
as we seek to expand our global organization  the hiring of qualified sales  technical and support personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products contain software defects  it could harm our revenues and expose us to litigation the software products we offer are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects  especially when we first introduce them 
we may need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix any defects or errors 
any defects or errors could also cause damage to our reputation and result in loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  or lack of market acceptance of our products 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of customers use of such products in mission critical applications 
if a claimant brings a product liability claim against us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products interoperate with many parts of complicated computer systems  such as mainframes  servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these parts could cause all or large parts of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which part failed  and it is likely that customers will bring a lawsuit against several suppliers 
even if our software is not at fault  we could suffer material expense and material diversion of management time in defending any such lawsuits 
our investments in privately held technology companies involve a number of risks and uncertainties we have invested in several privately held technology companies 
each of these investments involves risks and uncertainties  including diversion of management attention from our core business  failure to leverage our relationship with these companies to access new technologies and new markets  inability to value investments appropriately or to predict changes to the future value of investments  inability to manage investments effectively  and loss of cash invested 
during the fiscal  we recorded a charge to earnings of million related to impaired assets acquired as part of our privately held technology company investment program 
we have an investments balance of million at january   and there is a substantial risk that we will be required to treat a substantial portion  if not all  of such investments as impaired  particularly in view of the difficulties many such companies have had in raising additional capital in the current unfavorable economic climate and less favorable financing terms currently available 
if such assets were impaired  we would be required to take a charge to earnings which could be as large as the million carrying balance of such investments 
we have adopted a preferred stock rights plan which has anti takeover effects we have implemented a preferred stock rights plan 
the plan has the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the existence of the plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange bea s revenues originating outside the united states were percent  percent and percent of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues from each geographic sub region outside of the united states were less than percent of total revenues in fiscal and the only geographic sub region outside of the united states with revenues greater than percent of total revenues in fiscal was the united kingdom with million or percent 
international sales were made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
effective february   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency 
the company s objectives in holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts between the parent company in the united states and its foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall financial results 
the company has a program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european  canadian  asian and latin american currencies 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the company does not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with realized gains and losses included in interest income and other  net 
net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were approximately  for fiscal the company s outstanding forward contracts as of january  are presented in the table below 
this table presents the net notional amount in us dollars using the spot exchange rate in january and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 
notional weighted average exchange rates are quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in units per us dollar 
all of these forward contracts mature within days or less as of january  net notional amount notional weighted average exchange rate in thousands functional currency us dollar euros british pounds japanese yen swedish krona canadian dollars korean won australian dollars mexican pesos israeli shekels brazilian reals singapore dollar swiss francs norwegian kron total functional currency euro british pounds swiss francs norwegian kron swedish krona israeli shekels total grand total interest rates the company invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are primarily invested in interest bearing bank accounts and money market funds at the local operating banks 
the company accounts for its investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas 
all of the cash equivalents  short term investments and short term and long term restricted cash are treated as available for sale under fas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  the company reduces its interest rate risk by investing its cash in instruments with short maturities 
as of january   the average holding period until maturity of the company s cash equivalents  short and long term restricted cash and short term investments was approximately days 
the table below presents the principal amount and related weighted average interest rates for the company s investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments

the annual lease expense will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in libor 
a percent increase in libor will generate an increase in annual lease expense of approximately million 
the company is also exposed to changes in short term interest rates through our invested balances of cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  the yields on which will fluctuate with changes in short term interest rates 
a percent decrease in short term interest rates would result in an annual reduction of interest income of approximately million 
investments in equity securities the company has made investments in several privately held companies with an aggregate net carrying value of million as of january   several of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these nonmarketable investments are accounted for under the cost method  as ownership is less than percent and or the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  financing and investing activities of the investee companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is possible that the company could lose its entire initial investment in these companies 
as a part of management s process of regularly reviewing these investments for impairment  the company recorded write downs of million of certain investments  which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired in fiscal
