the company presents in its notes to the consolidated financial statements a summary of its most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of such statements 
the company s significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of its products 
therefore  the company s accounting principles in the areas of revenue recognition  trade accounts receivable valuation  inventory valuation  vendor transactions and marketing activities are the most significant 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
cdw bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in the company s results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
significant estimates in these financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and pricing disputes  net realizable value of inventories  vendor transactions and loss contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
cdw maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is determined based upon historical experience in addition to an ongoing credit quality review of the company s accounts receivable portfolio 
if the financial condition of cdw s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and operating income could be adversely affected 
sales returns and pricing disputes 
the company maintains an allowance for anticipated sales returns and pricing disputes based on recent trends 
should the actual rate of sales returns or pricing disputes increase  additional allowances may be required and gross margin and operating income could be adversely affected 
net realizable value of inventories 
the company adjusts the carrying value of its inventory for changes in net realizable value based upon current market values and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required and gross margin and operating income could be adversely affected 
vendor transactions 
the company and its vendors are involved in certain pricing and shipping disputes in the normal course of business 
the company establishes allowances for such disputes based upon an evaluation of identified disputes and an evaluation of recent and historical trends 
should the resolution of such disputes differ from management estimates  gross margin and operating income could be adversely affected 
loss contingencies 
from time to time  the company may have contingent liabilities which could result in a loss and a reduction to operating income 
as these events arise  management exercises judgment in evaluating the financial impact of these potential losses 
if actual losses differ from management s estimates  operating income could be adversely affected
