item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on august   checkers drive in restaurants  inc checkers and rally s hamburgers  inc  rally s completed their merger merger 
the merger of checkers with rally s was accounted for as a reverse acquisition as former shareholders of rally s owned a majority of the outstanding stock of checkers subsequent to the merger 
therefore  for accounting purposes  rally s is deemed to have acquired checkers 
all pre merger financial information represents the financial results for rally s only 
the post merger financial results include both rally s and checkers 
the merger has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations and is the principal reason for the differences when comparing results of operations for the periods ending december  and january  with the results of operations for the period ended january  as a result of the merger in fiscal  the company acquired checkers restaurants

our revenues and expenses are affected by the number and timing of additional restaurant openings and the sales volumes of both existing and new restaurants 
effective november   checkers and rally s entered into a management services agreement agreement whereby checkers provided accounting  technology  and other functional and management services to predominantly all of the operations of rally s

includes the results of operations for rally s only  through august  results of operations comparison of historical results fiscal years and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january  company owned restaurant sales decreased by million for the year  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the result from the sale of restaurants to franchisees during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal sales at comparable restaurants  which include only the units that were in operation for the full years being compared  increased in as compared with franchise royalties increased by million primarily as a result of the company owned restaurants sold to franchisees during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal royalties on these restaurants were recognized for a full year during the increase can also be attributed to increased average restaurant sales during fiscal as compared to franchise fees and other income decreased from million  in fiscal  to million for fiscal the decrease is due primarily to the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees during fiscal year costs and expenses 
restaurant food and paper costs totaled million or of restaurant sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in these costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to increased beef and cheese prices during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
restaurant labor costs  which include restaurant employees salaries  wages  benefits  bonuses and related taxes totaled million or of restaurant sales for fiscal compared with million or for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease as a percentage of sales is the result of volume efficiencies gained from increased average restaurant sales 
restaurant occupancy expense  which includes rent  property taxes  licenses and insurance totaled million or of restaurant sales in compared with million or in the increase in restaurant occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant sales is due to higher rental rates in the california market  as a result of taking back locations from cke in july of  and increasing insurance costs 
restaurant depreciation and amortization of million in remained consistent with million in the slight increase of of restaurant sales is due to the sale of restaurants in that were considered held for sale assets  and are therefore  not being depreciated 
the sale of these restaurants decreased company owned restaurant sales without an offsetting decrease in depreciation expense 
other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant level operating expenses and specifically includes utilities  maintenance and other costs 
these expenses totaled million or of restaurant sales in fiscal compared with million or in fiscal the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily related to increased repairs and maintenance during the first half of the current year as compared to the previous year  as we continued the refurbishment of our restaurants that began in late fiscal in addition  utilities costs also increased during fiscal general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues for fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues for fiscal the decrease in costs is due primarily to a decrease in corporate payroll by approximately million 
advertising expense decreased approximately million to million  or of restaurant sales for compared with for the decrease in dollars spent was due to a decrease in the average number of company owned restaurants operated during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the increase in average restaurant sales for the fiscal year bad debt expense remained relatively consistent at of total revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal non cash compensation resulted from certain options granted and modified in fiscal non cash compensation recognized in fiscal was million for those options granted with a vesting period through non cash compensation recognized in fiscal was million for both those option which immediately vested and those with vesting periods through other depreciation and amortization decreased to million or of total revenues for fiscal as compared to million or for fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreased depreciation expense for the property and equipment for the locations taken back from cke in july while they were operated by cke  checkers continued to own and depreciate the property 
depreciation expense was recorded as other depreciation because it was associated with other income 
once we began operating the restaurants in  restaurant sales were recognized and depreciation was recorded as restaurant depreciation 
during  the company realized million in total impairment charges relating to the closing of two company owned restaurants  the closing of twelve franchised restaurants with associated intangibles  and eleven under performing company owned restaurants 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of million 
during  the company recognized losses of 
million from restaurant closures related to the estimated future cost of surplus properties 
the company maintains a consist practice of reviewing the reserve for future expenses and recognizes additional loss to ensure the reserve is sufficient to meet estimated future requirements 
interest income 
interest income increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal primarily as the result of a large cash balance maintained during the current year for anticipated new restaurant openings 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million  or of total revenues for fiscal from million  or of total revenues for fiscal this decrease was due to the net reduction of debt by million and the restructuring of our capital during the current year and fiscal income tax 
the company s tax expense represents federal alternative minimum tax based upon estimated federal alternative minimum taxable income after utilizing the allowable portion of our net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s tax benefit was approximately  resulting primarily from a  favorable tax ruling in fiscal comparison of historical results fiscal years and revenues 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january  company owned restaurant sales decreased by million for the year  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the result from the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
this was partially offset by a full year of merged company revenues 
sales at comparable restaurants  which include only the units that were in operation for the full years being compared  decreased in as compared with franchise royalties increased by million  primarily as a result of the company owned restaurant sales to franchisees during fiscal franchise fees and other income increased to million from million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is due primarily to the sale of company owned restaurants to franchisees during fiscal year as compared to the sale of in costs and expenses 
restaurant food and paper costs remained consistent at of restaurant sales in compared with in the company continued to benefit from its participation in the purchasing co op with cke restaurants  inc and santa barbara restaurant group  inc 
this purchasing co op expired during restaurant labor costs  which include restaurant employees salaries  wages  benefits  bonuses and related taxes totaled million or of restaurant sales for compared with million or for the increase as a percentage of sales is due to increases in management salaries and other incentives to various employees designed to enhance retention rates on a going forward basis  as well as other increased labor rates 
restaurant occupancy expense  which includes rent  property taxes  licenses and insurance totaled million or of restaurant sales in compared with million or in restaurant occupancy expense increased primarily due to a full year of checkers operations being recognized in fiscal  as checkers occupancy costs are higher than rally s 
restaurant depreciation and amortization of million in decreased by million from million in primarily due to the sale of company owned restaurants 
other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant level operating expenses and specifically includes utilities  maintenance and other costs 
these expenses totaled million or of restaurant sales in compared with million or in the increase as a percent of sales was due primarily to a full year of checkers operations recognized in  as checkers restaurants have higher restaurant operating expenses 
advertising expense decreased approximately million to million  or of restaurant sales for compared with for the increase as a percentage relates primarily to the decrease in revenues due to the sale of company owned restaurants 
bad debt expense decreased to of total revenues from in the prior year 
this was the result of collectibility issues with certain franchisees in other depreciation and amortization remained consistent at million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses decreased million in to million  or of revenues as compared to million  or of revenues in the decrease is due primarily to the reduction of our administrative staff 
the loss on investment in affiliate in of million represents rally s share of the losses incurred by checkers million and the amortization of related goodwill million prior to the merger 
during and the company recorded impairment charges and loss provisions in accordance with sfas of and million  respectively 
during  the company recognized losses of 
million from restaurant closures related to the estimated future cost of surplus properties 
the company maintains a consist practice of reviewing the reserve for future expenses and recognizes additional loss to ensure the reserve is sufficient to meet estimated future requirements 
interest income 
interest income was lower for as compared to primarily as the result of a lower cash balance due to debt repayments 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately million for as compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the repayment of approximately million in debt during income tax 
the company s tax benefit was approximately  resulting primarily from a  favorable tax ruling in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the restaurant industry in general  operates with a working capital deficit because most of our investments are in long term restaurant operating assets 
we do not normally require large amounts of working capital to maintain operations since sales are for cash  purchases are on open accounts and meat and produce inventories are limited to a three to five day supply to assure freshness 
we do not have significant levels of accounts receivable or inventory  and receive credit from our trade suppliers 
funds available from cash sales not needed immediately to pay our trade suppliers are used for non current capital expenditures 
we have a working capital deficit of million at december  as compared to a million deficit at january  the decrease in the deficit is primarily due to the repayment of million of the textron note payable loan b  operating profits for the year of million  and additional capital contributions of million from the exercise of options and warrants into  shares of common stock 
the company is subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under certain of its debt agreements  including ebitda and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenants for the fiscal year ending december  however  we have received a waiver for the financial covenant for the year ended december   and through december  if the thirty three restaurants included in the ffca mortgage transactions are not in compliance with certain financial performance covenants  the company is allowed to substitute another property as security for the debt 
cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million to million during the year ended december  cash from operating activities was million  compared to million during the same period last year 
the increase of million is largely attributed to current profits and an increase in accrued liabilities 
cash flow used for investing activities was million related primarily to capital expenditures at existing restaurants and the acquisition of restaurants from a former franchisee 
the capital expenditures related primarily to point of purchase menu boards and building refurbishments 
cash used by financing activities was million 
we paid down million of the textron note payable loan b prior to refinancing the remaining million  in addition to monthly principal payments of approximately million 
we received  from the issuance of long term debt and million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and warrants during fiscal we have capital lease receivables for certain restaurants previously sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations for which we continue to be the primary obligor  and have equivalent liabilities recorded 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of december  was approximately million 
the company  as original lessee  has also subleased certain land associated with the sale of company owned restaurants under operating leases 
the revenue from these subleases is offset against rent expense  as we continue to be responsible for the rent payments to the original lessors 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that our existing cash at december   the expected cash provided from operations  and the available million line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition franchise fees and area development franchise fees are generated from the sale of rights to develop  own and operate restaurants 
such fees are based on the number of potential restaurants in a specific area which the franchisee agrees to develop pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement between the company and the franchisee and are recognized as income on a pro rata basis when substantially all of the company s obligations per location are satisfied  generally at the opening of the restaurant 
franchise fees are nonrefundable 
franchise fees and area development franchise fees received prior to substantial completion of the company s obligations are deferred 
the company receives royalty fees from franchisees based on a percentage of each restaurant s gross revenues 
royalty fees are recognized as earned 
gains associated with the sale of certain company owned restaurants to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases are recognized over the life of the related capital leases 
during fiscal years and  several company owned restaurants were sold to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases 
as a result of the sales  we have recorded lease receivables for those restaurants sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of december  was approximately million 
we have recorded deferred gains of million from these sales since we continue to be responsible for the payment of the obligations to the original lessors and mortgagors 
the deferred gains are included in the balance sheet under the captions accrued liabilities current and deferred revenues for million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived  identifiable intangible assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and 
our market capitalization relative to net book value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
requires the write down of certain intangibles and tangible property associated with under performing sites 
in applying sfas no 
 we reviewed all restaurants that recorded losses in the applicable fiscal years and performed a discounted cash flow analysis where indicated for each restaurant based upon such results projected over a five to fifteen year period 
this period of time was selected based upon the lease term and the age of the building  which we believe is appropriate 
impairments or recoveries are recorded to adjust the asset values to the amount recoverable under the discounted cash flow analysis  in accordance with sfas no 
the effect of applying sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of property  equipment and intangible assets of approximately million in  million in  million in in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million for the intangible value of our tradename 
we recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in  and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of in addition  we will assess the value of the tradename in accordance with sfas no 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts and accrued liabilities the preparation of financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  franchise concentrations  franchise credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
reserves for restaurant relocations and abandoned sites consists of our estimates for the ongoing costs of each location which has been closed or was never developed 
those costs include rent  property taxes  maintenance  utilities  and in some cases  the cost to relocate the modular restaurant to a storage facility 
the cash outlays for these costs have been estimated for various terms ranging from to years 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted in certain circumstances 
the company adopted sfas on january   and does not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption 
goodwill amortization was approximately million in fiscal and identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that an impairment exists 
effective january   we will cease to amortize the value recorded for our tradename  as we have assessed its life to be indefinite 
amortization expense recorded for the tradename was approximately million in fiscal and in august of  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes methods of accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized 
the company is currently reviewing this statement and the impact of its adoption on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company will implement sfas beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending december  future commitments the company is obligated under future commitments as part of its normal business operations  which are not included as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the future commitments are for operating lease payments and product purchases  summarized as follows year s thereafter s lease payments   product purchases   item a 
quantitive and qualitive disclosures about market risks interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations our exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes and availability could have on our debt 
borrowings under our primary debt facilities bear interest ranging from to 
an increase in short term and long term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within the company s control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
typically  the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases  which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins
