identical store sales  which excludes remodels with expansions of square footage greater than and relocations  increased approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
comparable and identical store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market

additionally  continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement  merchandising and controlling shrink has positively affected gross profit 
in all years  gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in certain departments such as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits

we continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the company s needs and market conditions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 

table of contents we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
insurance and self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
inventory valuation we value our inventories  both retail and wholesale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
lifo cost was determined using the retail method for approximately of inventories in both fiscal years and and was determined using the item cost method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value was approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
costs for the balance of inventories  consisting of the manufactured inventories of allegro coffee company  are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated
