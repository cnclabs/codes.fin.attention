the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
years ended net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and related expenses provision for excess capacity provision for uncollectables from a related party provision for product line move and other earnings loss before interest and taxation ebit other income expense interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales during fiscal net sales for the company decreased to million from million in fiscal the sales volume decrease was primarily due to lower commercial sales to domestic and foreign automotive customers due to competition supplying yaw rate sensors to the company s largest customer  lower automotive production levels for vehicles containing esp systems  lower product pricing  and to a lesser extent  reduced sales to industrial customers primarily due to the continuing soft economy 
sales to the automotive industry  including sales of the company s gyrochip sensors  decreased to million from million in fiscal sales to other industrial customers decreased million to million from million during fiscal resulting primarily from reduced sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
government related sales decreased million in fiscal to million from million during fiscal primarily from shipment timing on contracts 
during fiscal  net sales for the company increased to million from million in fiscal  reflecting continuing increases in sales due to growth in the automotive industry s demand for the company s gyrochip sensors used in automotive stability systems 
sales to the automotive industry  including sales of the company s gyrochip sensors  increased to million from million in fiscal sales to other industrial customers decreased million to million from million during fiscal resulting primarily from reduced sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
government related sales decreased million in fiscal to million from million during fiscal the company s sales to international customers were approximately   and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in international sales in fiscal is attributable to competitors supplying yaw rate sensors to the company s largest customer 
the increase in international sales in fiscal is attributable to increases in sales of the company s gyrochip sensors 
the vast majority of sales to non us customers are denominated in us dollars 
cost of sales and gross profit in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points due primarily to a lower proportion of automotive sales with higher than average cost of sales percentage offset to some degree by the impact of improved yields on the new automotive sensor cluster product 
there may be additional margin rate variability in future years due to the introduction of new products  changes in product pricing  changes in manufacturing processes and volumes  and product life cycles 
management continues to undertake technological initiatives designed to increase manufacturing and production efficiencies and attempts to maintain close relationships with vendors and customers in an effort to reduce costs and increase margins 
in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points due to increased shipments of products having higher average production costs 
the company also continued to expand its manufacturing capacity for the production of gyrochip sensors resulting in higher costs for employee hiring and training in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million from million in fiscal to million primarily due to management actions to reduce spending in light of sales decreases in the current fiscal year  which reduction was partially offset by an increase in the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily as a result of reduced sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal to million primarily as a result of costs incurred to support the increase in sales during fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of increased sales 
research  development and related expenses research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to management s dedication to the development of new and enhanced products  such as the next generation quartz and silicon automotive gyro sensors  ncaps  and improvements to other existing product families 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal the decrease is due to a spending reduction primarily associated with sitek  a majority owned subsidiary  partially offset by increased spending on the design and development of a non contacting position sensor eg ncaps and torque sensing technology for industrial and automotive applications 
the company believes that the continued timely development of new products and enhancements to its existing products is essential to maintaining its competitive position 
accordingly  the company anticipates that expenses associated with such efforts will increase in absolute amount  but may fluctuate as a percentage of sales depending on the company s success in acquiring customers or  in some cases  us government contracts funding research and development efforts 
related party expense and financing since inception  all operating capital for opticnet see business research and development has been provided by the company as debt or equity financing  as a result of opticnet s inability to gain outside financing from independent parties to date  in light of the severe downturn in the optical networking industry 
opticnet s net loss for the three month period from october  through december  of  is included in the consolidated results of the company 
originally  the company accounted for its investment in opticnet under the equity method of accounting until march   when the company deemed its investment impaired 
the company has recognized opticnet s entire net loss for the six months ended september  as of march   the company reserved its initial million investment in opticnet to zero 
in october  the company agreed to provide opticnet with a line of credit originally established for up to million  amended in march to allow for borrowings by opticnet of up to million 
during the fiscal quarter ended june   the company suspended the availability of advances to opticnet under the line of credit  under which amounts outstanding at such time totaled approximately million in principal amount 
in the six months ending september   the company provided an additional million of financing to opticnet  which was advanced with the intent to convert such cash advances into additional equity in opticnet  upon terms to be decided 
the million advanced was expensed during the third and fourth quarters  reflecting opticnet s net loss for the six month period from march  through september  effective september   opticnet issued a total of  shares of opticnet s nonvoting and nonconvertible series b preferred stock to the company  in consideration of million advanced during the third and fourth quarters to opticnet by the company 
see note for a further description of the relationship with opticnet 
provisions provisions for excess capacity  uncollectables from a related party and for product line moves consisted of approximately million related to the expected future losses on operating lease payments on facility and production assets that partially supported opticnet s operations  as well as million to reserve against nonpayment on the line of credit note receivable from opticnet and impairment of the original investment in opticnet 
additionally  the company wrote down approximately million for a product line move and other costs to close a facility and relocate manufacturing activities to a more cost effective location 
interest expense and other income interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense as a percentage of sales increased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to reduced sales and changes in the company s debt levels 
the company s fixed interest rate debt decreased in fiscal due to a principal payment on long term debt in november in addition  during fiscal the company borrowed on  and fully repaid  its line of credit as described under liquidity and capital resources below 
the company s average interest rate declined in fiscal due to use of lower cost bank borrowings 
the company s average interest rate in fiscal approximated the average interest rate in fiscal other net expense of million in fiscal was comprised of the company s interest in the net loss of opticnet  which included severance costs and other expenses to support their current level of operations 
other income in and was comprised of royalties and interest income earned on highly liquid investments 
other income was million and million for fiscal and respectively 
the higher income in fiscal resulted primarily from the sale in the second quarter of fiscal of an asset held for investment for million  net 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory us federal tax rate and the weighted average tax rate of the states in which the company conducts business 
the net increase of percentage points in fiscal from fiscal results from the company generating a pre tax loss in the current year and the adverse impact that result has on all the permanent difference items  in addition to a decrease in both the us federal statutory rate and the tax benefit related to foreign sales 
the decrease of percentage points in fiscal from fiscal results from increased federal and state tax credits and an increase in tax benefits related to foreign sales for the company during fiscal other factors may have favorable and unfavorable effects upon the company s effective tax rate in and subsequent years 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  and future levels of capital expenditures 
deferred income taxes at september   the company had net current deferred income tax assets of million and net non current deferred income tax assets of million 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependant upon the company s ability to either carry back the reversal of the underlying temporary differences and obtain a refund of taxes previously paid or generate sufficient taxable income in future years to benefit from the reversal of the underlying temporary differences 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  operations of the company provided million in cash 
a net loss of million plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and provisions of million  million  and respectively  together with a decrease in trade receivables  inventory  and assets held for sale of million  million  and million  respectively  provided million in cash 
these cash inflows were offset by decreases in other current assets of million  deferred income taxes of million and trade accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
investing activities for the company in fiscal consisted primarily of the purchase of million in capital equipment to support planned capacity increases for future production 
the majority of the equipment purchased was for the production of automotive quartz gyrochip sensor products 
this cash outflow was offset by the receipt of million in cash from the disposal of equipment and decrease in other assets of million resulting in net cash used by investing activities of million 
fiscal financing activities primarily consisted of debt payments of million  which consisted of million in principal paid on senior notes payable  as well as million in payments on the company s line of credit 
other cash used by financing activities included cash purchases of the company s stock at open market prices for million and dividend payments of million 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds from recurring borrowing on the company s line of credit of million  tax benefits from exercised stock options of million  and proceeds of million from stock issuances related to the exercise of options granted under the company s equity incentive plan  resulting in net cash used for financing activities of million during fiscal the company relies on its million line of credit and million of senior note funding  of which annual payments are due in the first fiscal quarter of the following year  to sustain operations 
there can be no assurance that these facilities will continue to be available to sustain future operating levels 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including cash provided by operating activities and available bank borrowings  will be adequate to fund the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation management believes that  for the periods presented  inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company reviews the accounting policies used in reporting its financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which the company based its assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product warranty the company records a warranty liability on its products at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience and any specific warranty issues that the company has identified 
although historical warranty costs have been within expectations  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same relative level of credit losses that it has in the past 
in addition  although the company s sales have historically been to many customers in a variety of markets  in recent periods  one automotive customer accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of that customer or a further deterioration in the economic environment in general could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of the company s accounts receivable and future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if  at the time of shipment  the company determines that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  the revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
inventories the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
inventories are carried principally at the lower of cost or fair value and do not exceed net realizable value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill management reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment either on an annual basis or quarterly if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected revenue  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
provision for excess capacity  uncollectables from a related party and product line move and other during the quarter ended march   the company established a reserve for the closure of a specific manufacturing facility 
this reserve required the use of estimates 
though the company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and actual results may be different 
income taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using the four sources of taxable income that may be considered under fas future reversals of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in the event it is determined more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination occurs 
litigation the company reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company reserves for known environmental claims  of which there are none in fiscal  when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s environmental reserves  for all periods presented  are recorded at the expected payment amount 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are primarily generated from the sale of electronic devices to our customers  typically the end user 
the company recognizes revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
under these guidelines  revenue recognition is deferred on transactions where i persuasive evidence of an arrangement does not exist  ii revenue recognition is contingent upon performance of one or more obligations of the company  iii the price is not fixed or determinable or iv payment is not reasonably assured 
property  plant and equipment and related depreciation the company records property  plant and equipment at cost  which is depreciated using the straight line method for structures and accelerated or straight line methods for equipment over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives 
management reviews the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment to verify that the assets are being depreciated in accordance with their usage and all assets no longer in service are fully depreciated 
accrued expenses and other liabilities the company records liabilities for services or products received in the period in which the benefit was recognized 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of these services or products received  actual costs may be substantially higher than the amounts recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign exchange rates  changes in the prices of marketable equity securities held as part of a deferred compensation plan a rabbi trust and interest income sensitivity 
the company has approximately  calculated based on the conversion rate for euros at september  permanently invested in the assets of ideacod  sas  located in strasbourg  france 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate amounts to  which would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the rabbi trust assets  consisting of cash equivalents and debt and equity securities  are offset by an equivalent deferred compensation liability to the trust participants 
the liability fluctuates equally with changes in the value of the assets 
because the liability completely offsets the assets of the trust  changes in asset value have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company s exposure to interest income sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  as a portion of the company s investments are in short term debt securities issued by corporations 
the company s investments are placed with high quality issuers and the company attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the nature of the company s short term investments  the company believes that it is not subject to any material market risk exposure 
the company does not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
