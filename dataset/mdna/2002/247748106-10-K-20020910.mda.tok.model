item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s utility operations are subject to regulation by the psc  which has a significant role in determining the company s return on equity 
the psc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment 
the company s rate tariffs allow the cost of gas to be passed through to customers see business regulatory matters 
the company s business is temperature sensitive 
accordingly  the company s sales volumes in any given period reflect  in addition to other factors  the impact of weather  with colder temperatures generally resulting in increased sales volumes by the company 
the company anticipates that this sensitivity to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to be reflected in the company s sales volumes in future periods 
however  delta s current tariffs  approved by the psc effective january   provide for some adjustment of gas rates through a weather normalization tariff see business regulatory matters 
under the weather normalization tariff  delta s rates for residential and small non residential customers are generally increased when winter weather is warmer than normal and decreased when winter weather is colder than normal 
delta is permitted to adjust rates for these classes of customers for the billing months of december through april under this tariff 
liquidity and capital resources because of the seasonal nature of delta s sales  the smallest proportion of cash generated from operations is received during the warmer months when sales volumes decrease considerably 
additionally  most construction activity takes place during the non heating season because of more favorable weather conditions 
during the warmer  non heating months  therefore  cash needs for operations and construction are partially met through short term borrowings 
capital expenditures for delta for fiscal are expected to be million 
the capital expenditures will be made for system extensions as well as the replacement and improvement of existing transmission  distribution  gathering and general facilities 
delta has been generating internally only a portion of the cash necessary for its capital expenditure requirements and thus finances the balance of its capital expenditures on an interim basis through the use of its borrowing capability under its short term line of credit 
the current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june  the line of credit  which is with bank one  kentucky  na  requires renewal during october  the company intends to pursue renewal or to enter into a new agreement and seek substantially the same terms as the existing agreement 
these short term borrowings are periodically repaid with the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities  as was done in march  when the net proceeds of  from the sale of  of debentures were used to repay short term debt and to redeem the company s debentures  that would have matured in  in the amount of  the primary cash flows during the last three years are summarized below provided by operating activities    used in investing activities    provided by used in financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash provided by operating activities consists of net income and noncash items including depreciation  depletion  amortization and deferred income taxes 
additionally  changes in working capital are also included in cash provided by operating activities 
the company expects that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating  normal capital expenditure and dividend requirements

is that future goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized beginning in instead of amortization  goodwill will be subject to an assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the company does not have recorded goodwill or intangible assets 
accordingly  these new accounting rules will not presently have a significant impact on the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk delta serves its regulated customers using a combination of spot market gas purchases and forward gas purchases 
the price of spot market gas is based on the market price at the time of delivery  while the price of a forward purchase is fixed months prior to the delivery of the gas 
some of delta s gas purchases are injected into gas storage facilities in the non heating months and withdrawn from storage for delivery to customers during the heating season 
the company has minimal price risk resulting from these gas purchase and storage arrangements because these gas costs are passed on to delta s regulated customers through the gas cost recovery rate mechanism 
delta s non regulated subsidiaries actively pursue gas sales opportunities for customers within and outside the company s service area 
at the time the company makes a sales commitment to one of these customers  the company attempts to cover this position immediately with gas purchase commitments matched to the terms of the related sales contract 
the non regulated subsidiaries attempt to minimize their exposure to price volatility by predetermining the gross profit on their sales at the time of each sales commitment 
none of the company s gas contracts is accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of the company s gas purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative  the company has designated these contracts as normal purchases under sfas no
