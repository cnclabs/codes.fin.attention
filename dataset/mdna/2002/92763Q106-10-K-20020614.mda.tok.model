fiscal year overview virage  inc is a provider of software products  professional services and application services that enable owners of rich media and video assets to more effectively communicate  manage  retrieve and distribute these rich media assets for improved productivity and communications 
depending on their particular needs and resources  our customers may elect to license our software products or employ our application or professional services 
our customers include media and entertainment companies  other corporations  government agencies and educational institutions 
application products launches our traditional video software offerings  including our smartencode and server suite of products  have historically met the needs of users who have video and rich media assets and need to publish  manage  and distribute these assets over the internet and or their intranets 
in order to expand the market for our technology beyond these products  we have recently refocused our product development  sales  and marketing strategies in an effort to address common business user problems in multiple areas of an enterprise 
we want to provide these users with a quick  reliable  and scalable solution to their problems while affording them a definitive return on their investment 
pursuant to this goal  in december  we announced our first two rich media application products vs publishing and vs webcasting 
vs publishing offers media and entertainment customers a streamlined workflow for rich media web publishing  including a simple editorial control and greater website programming capabilities 
the new product allows content owners to publish more content with fewer resources 
vs publishing is available as either in house software or as a hosted service 
vs webcasting allows corporations to self produce live and on demand webcasting events such as executive communications  human resource broadcasts and webinars 
webcasts can include audio and video synchronized with slide presentations and documents as well as audience polls and questions 
at the same time  vs webcasting creates a searchable  on demand version of the event that is available after the live broadcast is completed 
vs webcasting is available as either in house software or as a hosted service 
in february and april  respectively  we announced our third and fourth software application products  vs learning and vs production 
vs learning is a new enterprise software application for rich media training and e learning that enables companies to create  manage  publish and view on demand training courses and presentations containing video and other rich media information 
the solution is available both as a licensed software product and as a hosted service 
vs production is an integrated software solution for media and entertainment enterprises that automates the professional video production process from acquisition to distribution 
we believe that the success of our application products is critical to our future and have heavily invested our resources in the development  marketing  and sale of them 
the market for our application products is in a relatively early stage 
we cannot predict how much the market for our application products will develop  and part of our strategic challenge will be to convince enterprise customers of the productivity  communications  cost  and other benefits of our solutions 
our future revenues and revenue growth rates will depend in large part on our success in creating market acceptance for our application products 
business restructuring charges during the year ended march   we continually evaluated our cost structure  reviewed the relative success of our various service offerings  and analyzed our geographical office needs based on historical and expected future market demands 
as part of these reviews  we reduced headcount and infrastructure  particularly in our application services business  and consolidated operations throughout the world  resulting in headcount reductions of approximately employees and the recording of  in business restructuring charges during the year 
a breakdown of our business restructuring charges and the remaining restructuring accrual as of march  is as follows expenditures balance at category additions cash non cash march  excess facilities and other exit costs employee separation and other costs equipment write downs total  excess facilities and other exit costs excess facilities and other exit costs relate to lease obligation and closure costs associated with offices we have vacated as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
the office locations affected by our cost restructuring efforts include our san mateo  california  and munich  germany offices 
in our san mateo headquarters location  we have an operating lease commitment for approximately  square feet of office space  an amount higher than our current needs 
as a result  we have vacated a portion of this facility and recorded  in expense 
it is management s best estimate that this space will continue to be vacant for the next months and that we will not be able to recoup the losses from our rental payments for the period from april  to march  by earning a profit from a sub lessee at some point over the course of our obligation period  which continues through september the current commercial real estate market in northern california is poor for sub lessors looking for tenants  and while we will make every attempt to secure a sublease  we believe that we will be unable to sublease this additional space at a reasonable rate for the next months 
we also recorded other excess facilities costs of  primarily related to our  square foot facility in san mateo 
should we continue to have excess operating lease capacity and be unable to find a sub lessee at a rate equivalent to our operating lease rate  we would be required to record additional charges for the rental payments that we owe to our landlord relating to this excess facility 
our management reviews its facility requirements and assesses whether any excess capacity exists as part of our on going financial processes 
due to an unfavorable market environment in germany and most of central europe  we decided to close our satellite sales office in munich  germany  in march pursuant to this closure  we recorded approximately  in exit costs  primarily attributable to equipment lease commitments and legal fees 
we do not have any outstanding operating lease commitments in germany for office space after the closure of the office in march employee severance employee separation and other costs  which include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other benefits  totaled approximately  during the year ended march  representing approximately terminated employees  of which  had been paid in cash as of march  personnel affected by the cost reduction initiatives include employees in positions throughout the company in sales  marketing  services  engineering  and general and administrative functions in all geographies  with a particular emphasis on our application services employees as we further downsized this business 
equipment write downs as part of our cost restructuring efforts  we decided to substantially downsize our application services offering  both in response to weak market conditions and to the termination of our contract with our largest customer during the year ended march  pursuant to these efforts  we reduced our application services infrastructure by taking a portion of our production equipment out of service and subsequently writing off approximately  in assets at net book value  primarily in our new york office 
should we lose other application services customers  we may have excess capacity and be required to record additional charges for excess capital equipment and or other infrastructure costs 
our management reviews its capacity requirements and assesses whether any excess capacity exists as part of our on going financial processes 
voluntary stock option cancellation and re grant program in february  we canceled  stock options of certain employees who elected to participate in our voluntary stock option cancellation and re grant program 
many of our employees canceled stock options that had significantly higher exercise prices in comparison to where our common stock price currently trades 
on approximately august   we currently have an obligation to issue  stock options with a new exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of our stock on august  as a result of this program  we were required to accelerate the amortization of the remaining deferred compensation related to these canceled stock options 
this acceleration of amortization is included in the  of deferred compensation expense recorded in our statement of operations for the year ended march  we believe that this program will help to retain our employees and to improve our workforce morale 
however  this program may cause dilution to our existing stockholder base  which may cause our stock price to fall 
additionally  the exercise price of the new option could potentially be higher than the price of the cancelled options  which would render the options less effective as an incentive for our employees 
critical accounting policies estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed as part of our management s on going financial processes 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates include accounting for revenue recognition and the accounting and related estimates for our commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements for the sale of licenses of software products and related maintenance contracts  application services and professional services offerings  and also receive revenues under us government agency research grants 
service revenues include revenues from maintenance contracts  application services  and professional services 
other revenues are primarily us government agency research grants 
our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 deferral of the effective date of sop  software revenue recognition sop  and statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions sop and is also consistent with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements for each arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria are met 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond twelve months and other arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
no customer has the right of return 
arrangements consisting of license and maintenance 
for those contracts that consist solely of license and maintenance  we recognize license revenues based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered as prescribed by sop we recognize maintenance revenues over the term of the maintenance contract as vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance exists 
in accordance with paragraph ten of sop  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of maintenance is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when it is sold separately that is  the renewal rate 
each license agreement offers additional maintenance renewal periods at a stated price 
maintenance contracts are typically one year in duration 
revenue is recognized on a per copy basis for licensed software when each copy of the license requested by the customer is delivered 
revenue is recognized on licensed software on a per user or per server basis for a fixed fee when the product master is delivered to the customer 
there is no right of return or price protection for sales to domestic and international distributors  system integrators  or value added resellers collectively  resellers 
in situations where the reseller has a purchase order or other contractual agreement from the end user that is immediately deliverable  we recognize revenue on shipment to the reseller  if other criteria in sop are met  since we have no risk of concessions 
we defer revenue on shipments to resellers if the reseller does not have a purchase order or other contractual agreement from an end user that is immediately deliverable or other criteria in sop are not met 
we recognize royalty revenues upon receipt of the quarterly reports from the vendors 
when licenses and maintenance are sold together with professional services such as consulting and implementation  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the criteria in the previous paragraph have been met  payment of the license fee is not dependent upon the performance of the professional services  and the services do not include significant alterations to the features and functionality of the software 
should professional services be essential to the functionality of the licenses in a license arrangement which contains professional services or should an arrangement not meet the criteria mentioned above  both the license revenues and professional service revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the implementation services and the implementation services do not include contractual milestones or other acceptance criteria  we account for the arrangements under the percentage of completion contract method pursuant to sop based upon input measures such as hours or days 
when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method is utilized 
when an arrangement includes contractual milestones  we recognize revenues as such milestones are achieved provided the milestones are not subject to any additional acceptance criteria 
application services 
application services revenues consist primarily of account set up  web design and integration fees  video processing fees and application hosting fees 
account set up  web design and integration fees are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is generally six to twelve months 
we generate video processing fees for each hour of video that a customer deploys 
processing fees are recognized as encoding  indexing and editorial services are performed and are based upon hourly rates per hour of video content 
application hosting fees are generated based on the number of video queries processed  subject to monthly minimums 
we recognize revenues on transaction fees that are subject to monthly minimums on a monthly basis since we have no further obligations  the payment terms are normal and each month is a separate measurement period 
professional services 
we provide professional services such as consulting  implementation and training services to our customers 
revenues from such services  when not sold in conjunction with product licenses  are generally recognized as the services are performed 
other revenues 
other revenues consist primarily of us government agency research grants that are best effort arrangements 
the software development arrangements are within the scope of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 research and development arrangements 
as the financial risks associated with the software development arrangement rests solely with the us government agency  we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
the cost of these services are included in cost of other revenues 
the company s contractual obligation is to provide the required level of effort hours  technical reports  and funds and man hour expenditure reports 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess each customer s ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
to date  we believe that our revenue recognition has been proper and our related reserves have been sufficient 
commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to commitments and contingencies  including operating leases  restructuring liabilities  and legal proceedings and claims that cover a wide range of matters  including securities related litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business 
we record accruals for such contingencies based upon our assessment of the probability of occurrence and  where determinable  an estimate of the liability 
we consider many factors in making these assessments including past history and the specifics of each matter 
we believe that there are no claims or actions pending or threatened against us that would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
further  we review our assessment of the likelihood of loss on any outstanding contingencies as part of our management s on going financial processes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
fiscal years ended march  revenues license revenues service revenues other revenues total revenues cost of revenues license revenues service revenues other revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss series e convertible preferred stock dividend net loss applicable to common stockholders we incurred net losses applicable to common stockholders of   and  during the three years ended march   and  respectively 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our market and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and other operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our historic revenue growth rates are not necessarily sustainable or indicative of our future growth 
fiscal years ended march  and revenues 
total revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  this increase was due to increases in license  service and other revenues 
international revenues increased in absolute dollars to  or of total revenues  in fiscal from  or of total revenues  in fiscal one customer accounted for of total revenues in fiscal there were no customers who accounted for more than of total revenues in fiscal license revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was a result of both higher unit sales of our videologger and virage solution server products and the introduction of new product lines 
recently  our largest reseller announced that it will divest its business segment in which our products are most complementary 
as a result  we encountered very little channel sales activity from this reseller during the final fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ended march  we believe this factor contributed to our quarterly decline in total revenues during the final fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ended march  as a result of the loss of this channel partner  or if we were to lose one of our other large customers  or if this customer or any other large customer were to delay or default on obligations under their contracts with us  our future operating results could be significantly harmed 
service revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  approximately of this increase was due to revenue growth from our application services offering while of this increase was due to higher revenues from our professional services and training offerings 
the remainder was due to an increase in the number of customers purchasing maintenance contracts 
service revenues in fiscal include  of warrant amortization recorded as contra service revenues resulting from a warrant issued to mlbam 
the growth in application services revenues was primarily attributable to higher revenues from mlbam  which accounted for of total revenues during the year ended march  we do not expect any revenues from mlbam in the current fiscal year since we could not mutually agree on terms for a renewal of this contract 
we believe this factor contributed to our quarterly decline in total revenues during the final fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ended march  other revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  this increase was attributable to the level of engineering services performed pursuant to federal government research contracts 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of royalty fees for third party software products integrated into our products 
our cost of service revenues includes personnel expenses  related overhead  communication expenses and capital depreciation costs for maintenance and support activities and application and professional services 
our cost of other revenues primarily includes engineering personnel expenses and related overhead for engineering research for government projects 
total cost of revenues increased to  or of total revenues  in fiscal from  or of total revenues  in fiscal this increase in total cost of revenues was due to increases in the cost of service and other revenues  slightly offset by a decrease in the cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased to  or of license revenues  in fiscal from  or of license revenues  in fiscal this decrease was due to slightly lower unit sales of our products that are subject to unit based rather than fixed fee license royalty payments in fiscal in comparison to fiscal cost of service revenues increased to  or of service revenues  in fiscal from  or of service revenues in fiscal this increase in absolute dollars was due to expenditures to support the growth of our application services business  particularly in support of our contract with mlbam 
as a result of both the termination of our contract with mlbam and lower demand for our application services offering  we expect our cost of service revenues to decline in the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to control costs and improve gross profit margins in this area 
cost of other revenues increased to  or of other revenues  in fiscal from  or of other revenues  in fiscal this absolute dollar increase was attributable to the level of engineering services performed pursuant to federal government research contracts 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development efforts 
research and development expenses increased to  or of total revenues  in fiscal from  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to our business restructuring charges  particularly in connection with our lease write downs  and was partially offset by lower variable headcount costs and reduced localization expenses 
we expect research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we believe that significant product development expenditures are essential for us to maintain and enhance our market position and expand into new user markets 
to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs as they have been insignificant after establishing technological feasibility 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force  pre sales support and marketing staff  and marketing programs including trade shows and seminars 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  or of total revenues  in fiscal from  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to our business restructuring charges  particularly in connection with our lease write downs  and was partially offset by lower travel costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain in the range of relatively flat to a modest increase for the foreseeable future as we attempt to limit our overall expense growth for the company and to focus our marketing activities in specific areas  particularly with respect to our new application products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities  costs of our external audit firm and costs of our outside legal counsel 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of total revenues  in fiscal from  or of total revenues  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower variable headcount costs and reduced professional services fees  and was partially offset by business restructuring charges  particularly in connection with our lease write downs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we incur additional professional services costs  including higher legal fees and insurance premiums  especially for our director and officer liability insurance coverage 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation calculated as the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted to our employees and the then deemed fair value of our common stock for stock options granted to our employees 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  in connection with the granting of stock options to our employees 
our stock based compensation expense in fiscal increased due to the cancellation of stock options resulting from participation in our voluntary stock option cancellation and re grant program for our employees 
effective april   we expect that stock based compensation expense will decrease due to the immediate expensing of the majority of our employee related deferred compensation in our fourth fiscal quarter of we will continue to amortize the remaining deferred compensation balance as expense for employees who did not participate in our voluntary stock option cancellation and re grant program 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  includes interest income from cash and cash equivalents offset in fiscal by interest on capital leases and bank debt 
interest and other income  net  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  the decrease was a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances during fiscal provision for income taxes 
we have not recorded a provision for federal and state or foreign income taxes in either fiscal or because we have experienced net losses since inception  which have resulted in deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance through future taxable profits

we recognized stock based compensation expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  in connection with the granting of stock options to our employees 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  the increase was due to interest income from increased cash balances  primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public offering in june provision for income taxes 
we have not recorded a provision for fiscal income taxes 
we recorded a provision for fiscal for current foreign and state income taxes of  we have experienced net losses since inception  which have resulted in deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance through future taxable profits 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  a decrease of  from march  and our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was  a decrease of  in working capital from march  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and our working capital is primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities 
our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the cash used in these periods was primarily attributable to net losses applicable to common stockholders of   and  in the years ended march   and  respectively  offset by depreciation  losses on disposals of assets  and non cash  stock based charges 
investing activities resulted in cash inflows of  for the year ended march  and cash outflows of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
our investing inflows were primarily from the maturity of our short term investments and our outflows were primarily for the purchase of short term investments and capital equipment 
we expect that we will continue to invest in short term investments and purchase capital equipment as we replace older equipment with newer models 
financing activities provided net cash inflows of   and  during the years ended march   and  respectively 
these inflows were primarily from the proceeds of our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal and from sales of our preferred and common stock including our ipo in fiscal during fiscal and at march   we have contractual and commercial commitments not included on our balance sheet primarily for our san mateo  california facility that we have an obligation to lease through september these commitments are payable in each of our fiscal years ended march as follows  in   in   in   in and  in  in total 
additional information regarding our contractual and commercial commitments is provided in note of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item  of this annual report 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financings  or other sources  to fund our operations and potential acquisitions  if any  until we achieve profitability  if ever 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing when necessary to fund our business 
failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas 
fas requires use of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling method 
fas also provides new criteria to determine whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill 
under the new criteria  an acquired intangible asset would not be recognized separately from goodwill unless either control over the future economic benefits results from contractual or legal rights or the asset is capable of being separated or divided and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on its financial position or its results of operations or cash flows as the company has not participated in any business combinations through march  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets fas 
fas states that amortization of goodwill will no longer be required 
instead  impairment to goodwill is to be tested at least annually at the reporting unit level using a two step impairment test whereby the first step determines if goodwill is impaired and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss 
while goodwill is to be tested for impairment annually  companies may need to test for goodwill impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs that might significantly reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
regarding amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  the fasb requires intangible assets to be amortized over their useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment 
intangible assets that have economic lives that are indefinite would not be subject to amortization until there is evidence that their lives no longer are indefinite  and would be tested for impairment annually using a lower of cost or fair value approach 
the provisions of fas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently believes that fas will not have a material impact on its financial position or its results of operations or cash flows as the company has no goodwill or intangible assets subject to the requirements of fas in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fas and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company adopted fas as of april  and it does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement the announcement  topic d  which concluded that the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses should be classified as revenue in the statement of operations 
this announcement is to be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  upon application of this announcement  comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
the company adopted the announcement in its fiscal fourth quarter of its year ended march  and the announcement did not have a material affect on the company s operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states 
we currently license our products from the united states and from our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
substantially all of our sales from the united states operation are denominated in us dollars 
our subsidiary based in the united kingdom incurs most of its expenses in pounds sterling and most of its sales are denominated in us dollars 
we are unaware of any known trends or uncertainties that have had or will have a material impact on total revenues  expenses or loss from continuing operations related to the euro conversion 
we expect that future license and service revenues will continue to be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our financial results could be affected adversely by various factors  including foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use economic hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
through march   we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities 
interest rate risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on our investment securities because a substantial majority of our investments are in fixed rate securities with maturities not exceeding months 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income as of march   would decrease by approximately  for a basis point increase and increase by approximately  for a basis point decrease in interest rates 
our investment instruments are mainly fixed rate and relatively short term
