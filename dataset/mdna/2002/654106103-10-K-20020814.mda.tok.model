item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
in the past  actual returns and claims have not exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our reserves 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 

table of contents inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation advertising and promotion expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
certain contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record in selling and administrative expense the minimum guaranteed payment amount uniformly over the remaining royalty term 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
under current accounting standards  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as other expense 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
for fiscal  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets including property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets has been recorded under current accounting standards 
however  as of june   we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we expect to record an impairment charge related to the goodwill 
table of contents and other intangible assets of our subsidiaries bauer nike hockey  inc and cole haan holdings  inc in the first quarter of fiscal see recently issued accounting standards below 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than current earnings until the underlying hedged transaction affects current earnings 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into current earnings some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated 
in the event actual cash needs of our us entities exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities are less than expected  we may need to repatriate foreign earnings which have been designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore 
this would result in additional income tax expense being recorded 
we take a conservative approach in determining the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested offshore 
as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  the presumption is that such earnings will be repatriated in the future 
in order to overcome this presumption  we carefully review all factors which drive the ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this conservative approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  there is a possibility that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
conversely  this conservative approach may result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this latter case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this 
table of contents continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
results of operations fiscal highlights revenues increased to billion  compared to billion in fiscal income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased to million from million in the prior year  an increase of

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
diluted earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change improved  from to 
these increases reflected a increase in income before income taxes and a point decrease in our effective income tax rate 
the increase in income before income taxes was due to increased revenues  improved gross margins and lower interest and other expenses  partially offset by a slight increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal revenues were the highest in our history  reflecting increased nike brand sales in all of our geographic regions 
in the us  nike brand revenues increased for the fiscal year  driven by increased sales of apparel and equipment 
the increased sales in apparel reflected higher demand for in line products  particularly for nike brand and brand jordan basketball apparel  more than offsetting the effect of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the national football league last year 
in equipment  our rapidly growing golf business drove a increase for the year 
us footwear revenues declined versus fiscal while in line sales of footwear increased compared to last year  particularly in the mid range price segment  close out sales decreased significantly 
the reduction in close out sales reflected both our efforts to limit the availability of close out products in the marketplace in order to build overall profitability and relatively high levels of close out sales in the last half of fiscal due to supply chain system disruptions discussed further below in the fiscal compared to 
table of contents fiscal section 
as in the apparel business  sales of nike brand and brand jordan basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of increased wholesale sales of in line footwear during the year 
in fiscal  nike brand revenues from our international regions continued to grow versus the prior year  both as a percentage of total company revenues and in total dollars 
these revenues represented of total company revenues as compared to in fiscal revenues from our international regions were billion as compared to billion in fiscal  a increase 
had the us dollar remained constant with the prior year  these international revenues would have increased  and consolidated revenues would have increased compared to growth as reported 
increased revenues in each of our international regions resulted from higher demand for products in all nike brand businesses footwear  apparel  and equipment 
revenues in our europe  middle east  and africa emea region increased for the eighth consecutive year 
fiscal reported revenues in emea increased by over fiscal  a increase in constant dollars 
in our asia pacific region  reported revenues grew  a increase in constant dollars 
the americas region grew reported revenues  an increase in constant dollars  despite a drop off in sales in argentina during the second half of the year due to that country s economic crisis 
in fiscal  other revenue  which primarily includes revenues from bauer nike hockey  cole haan  and hurley  increased to million 
foot locker  inc is our largest single customer and represented of our worldwide revenues in fiscal foot locker has expressed its intention to reduce the emphasis of its us business on higher priced  premium footwear and place more focus on moderately priced offerings 
due to this change in strategy  foot locker s futures orders in the us for the holiday season scheduled for delivery from september through november decreased significantly versus the same period in the previous year 
in spite of the reduction in orders from foot locker  total us futures orders for the september to november period are down only versus the prior year and worldwide futures orders for the same period increased versus fiscal the impact of lower orders from foot locker for the september to november period was largely included in the june to november futures orders reported in our june  press release 
however  additional changes in november orders from foot locker reduced the overall growth of worldwide futures for the six month period by approximately basis points to 
although we expect foot locker to continue to be an important retail partner for nike  second half us footwear orders from this customer will likely be significantly below the prior year 
we are aggressively pursuing incremental sales across our business as we work to offset these declines and achieve our worldwide revenue growth goals for the year 
we believe there continues to be strong consumer demand for high end  performance footwear  this segment has always been central to the success of the nike brand 
therefore  we will continue to work aggressively with those retailers who are focused on serving this market 
while the success of these efforts over the next few quarters is uncertain  we remain confident in the long term strength of our brand and our business 
worldwide futures advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal the percentage growth in futures orders is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth in subsequent periods 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between future orders and actual revenues 
finally  a significant portion of our revenues are not derived from futures orders  including wholesale sales of equipment  us licensed team apparel  bauer nike hockey  cole haan  hurley  and retail sales across all brands 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect that revenue growth will lag futures order growth  reflecting lower close out sales versus the first quarter of fiscal and lower retail sales versus the same period last year as us retail sales have remained at relatively low levels since the terrorist attacks of september

relatively higher air freight costs were incurred in fiscal due to supply chain problems discussed following 
a higher mix of in line sales versus close out sales of us footwear  reflecting increased demand for in line footwear and lower close out sales as compared to fiscal as discussed above 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal operating overhead increased during fiscal largely as a result of our continued investment in initiatives intended to generate future revenues and profits 
significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included increased investment in our supply chain initiative  additional headcount to support our growing golf and european businesses  additional expense for compensation programs tied to our 
table of contents profitability and stock performance  and costs for additional retail stores primarily in our emea and asia pacific regions 
the supply chain initiative refers to our on going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain 
this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions  margins by lowering close outs and distribution costs and cash flow by reducing inventories 
the ultimate level of benefit to revenues  margins  and cash flows  if any  will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented worldwide over the next few years 
during fiscal  we implemented new systems and processes for certain global functions and for our us business  and we plan on implementing new systems and processes in emea during fiscal in fiscal  we will continue to invest in the implementation of the new systems worldwide and support our existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we have not yet implemented the new systems 
demand creation expense was  million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  which was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues 
our fiscal demand creation expense reflected incremental spending for our world cup marketing campaign  which occurred primarily in our international regions 
in fiscal  we expect demand creation expense to grow slightly faster than revenues  reflecting the continuation of the world cup campaign into the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we have entered into a long term license and endorsement agreement with manchester united  one of the premier soccer clubs in the world  which begins in august payments under this contract will result in additional demand creation expense 
interest expense decreased  from million to million in fiscal  due to lower interest rates in the current year and lower average debt levels  as we used operating free cash flow to reduce debt 
other income expense was a net expense of million versus a net expense of million in fiscal consistent with previous years  other income expense included interest income  profit sharing expense  goodwill amortization  certain foreign currency conversion gains and losses  and asset disposal gains losses 
net other expense decreased between years as the fiscal amount included charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal in addition  fiscal other income expense included credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding claims 
our fiscal effective tax rate was as compared to in fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  we do not accrue for us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily the result of a larger amount of foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal than in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net income increased over fiscal  from million to million 
although consolidated revenues increased over fiscal  income before income taxes was essentially flat as pretax profit margins decreased due to a lower gross margin percentage  higher interest expense  and increased other expenses  partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
despite flat income before income taxes  net income increased due to a lower effective tax rate 
diluted earnings per share increased  from to 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was higher than that of net income primarily due to share repurchases in fiscal years and nike brand revenues in the us region increased as compared to fiscal  while nike brand revenues in our international regions increased 
had the us dollar remained constant with the prior year  these international revenues would have increased  and consolidated revenues would have advanced 
in the us region  our largest market segment  the increase in revenues reflected a increase in apparel sales and a increase in equipment sales  offset by a decrease in footwear sales 
the increases in apparel and equipment reflected stronger demand for in line products 
the increase in the equipment product line reflected increases in a variety of sports equipment categories  including golf  football  and baseball products as well as socks  bags and eyewear 
the decrease in footwear reflected lower demand  particularly in the mid range price segment  and supply chain disruptions resulting from the implementation of 
table of contents a new global demand and supply planning system 
the supply chain disruptions resulted in product excesses as well as product shortages and late deliveries in the second half of the fiscal revenues from our international regions were billion as compared to billion in fiscal fiscal revenues in emea increased over fiscal by to  million  a increase in constant dollars 
in our asia pacific region  revenues grew  a increase in constant dollars 
the americas region grew revenues  an increase in constant dollars 
in fiscal  other revenue increased to million 
our gross margin percentage declined basis points  from in fiscal to in fiscal factors contributing to the lower gross margin percentage were as follows the effect of the change in foreign exchange rates  most notably the weakening of the euro against the us dollar relative to fiscal a higher mix of close out sales as well as lower margins achieved on close outs  primarily in footwear and licensed team apparel in the us in footwear  the higher mix of close outs and lower close out margins were due in part to the supply chain disruptions discussed above 
higher close outs and lower margins in us licensed team apparel resulted primarily from the liquidation of national football league nfl team apparel  due to the termination of our nfl license agreement 
product recalls of certain footwear models in the united states  which resulted in product returns and write offs 
selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
demand creation expense decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
fiscal demand creation expense was million versus million in fiscal the overall decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflected cost containment measures  both in marketing and operational areas 
while implementing these measures to control selling and administrative expense growth  we also continued to invest in operational initiatives designed to create future revenues and profits 
these initiatives included the expansion of nike owned retail outlets  the development of e commerce applications  and systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain 
our level of investment in these areas in fiscal was comparable to our level of investment in fiscal interest expense increased  from million to million  due to higher average debt levels in fiscal versus fiscal during fiscal  we increased debt to fund capital expenditures and higher working capital requirements  and to repurchase common stock 
although our debt balance decreased during fiscal  the average debt balance for fiscal remained above the prior year 
other income expense was a net expense of million versus a net expense of million in fiscal significant amounts included in other income expense were interest income  profit sharing expense  goodwill amortization  certain foreign currency conversion gains and losses  asset disposal gains and losses  and charges for contractual settlements 
our fiscal effective tax rate was as compared to in fiscal as discussed above  we do not accrue for us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily the result of lower taxes on a larger amount of foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore in fiscal than in fiscal as well as additional research tax credits 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations fas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after june  fas also requires a more rigorous identification of intangible assets which must be 
table of contents recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the adoption of fas will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
our adoption date is june  as of that date  amortization of outstanding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets will cease 
as a result of the elimination of this amortization  other expense will decrease by approximately million annually beginning in fiscal as required by fas  we will perform impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of the adoption date 
thereafter  we will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
in connection with the fas indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test  we will utilize the required one step method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the adoption date 
the test will consist of a comparison of the estimated fair values of indefinite lived assets with the carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds our estimate of its fair value  we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
in connection with the fas transitional goodwill impairment test  we will utilize the required two step method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption date 
to accomplish this  we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning our assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the adoption date 
we will then estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit  we then will perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
where necessary  in the second step  we will compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which will be measured as of the adoption date 
the implied fair value of goodwill will be determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fas the residual fair value after this allocation will be the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we will record a transitional impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit over the implied fair value 
we have estimated that we will likely incur a transitional impairment loss of approximately million related to our bauer nike hockey and cole haan subsidiaries  reflecting that the fair values we have estimated for these subsidiaries are less than the carrying values including goodwill 
this expected transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of income during the first quarter of fiscal in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  and amends accounting principles board statement no 
 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb 
fas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell 
fas retains the fundamental provisions of fas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement also retains apb s requirement that companies report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
all provisions of this statement will be effective for us on june  we do not expect that the adoption of fas will have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources fiscal cash flow activity cash provided by operations was  million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow was net income earned during the year of million 
operating cash flow increased significantly over the prior year due to reduced investment in certain working capital components during fiscal  which generated positive operating cash flow 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal was million  compared to million invested during fiscal the total for fiscal related primarily to capital expenditures for computer equipment and software  driven by our supply chain initiative  and investments in new retail outlets 
in addition  we acquired all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of hurley international llc  a teen lifestyle brand company 
during fiscal  we will continue to incur expenditures related to systems improvements most notably the supply chain initiative  retail expansion  and investments in our worldwide warehouse facilities 
cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million  up from million in the prior year 
this amount included uses of cash for dividends to shareholders  a net reduction in debt  and share repurchases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the share repurchases were part of a billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal  after completion of a four year  billion program in fiscal in fiscal  we repurchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
to date  under the current program  we have purchased a total of million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
we expect to fund the current program from operating cash flow 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments our significant long term contractual obligations as of may  are as follows cash payments due during the year ended may  description of commitment thereafter total in millions operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts are likely be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments disclosed above  we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
an outsourcing contractor provides us with information technology operations management services through the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor s services 
if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may   we would 
table of contents be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination liability of million 
our monthly payments to the contractor currently are approximately million 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the below short term debt obligations 
outstanding as of may  in millions commercial paper outstanding and other notes payable for us operations  all original maturities ninety five days or less notes payable for non us operations  due at a mutually agreed upon dates  generally ninety days from issuance or on demand payable to nissho iwai american company niac for the purchase of inventories  generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding for the purchase of inventories 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
capital resources we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec under which billion in debt securities are available to be issued 
on may   we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes  as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements 
as of may   we had not issued any debt securities under the shelf registration 
subsequent to may   we issued a total of million in notes under the medium term note program 
the notes have coupon rates that range from to 
the maturities range from july  to august  for million of the notes  we simultaneously entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the six month london inter bank offering rate libor plus a spread 
each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its respective note 
after issuance of these notes  million remains available to be issued under our shelf registration 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on working capital and general corporate needs 
as of may   we had a million  day committed credit facility and a million  multi year committed credit facility in place with a group of banks 
in november  we renewed the day facility in the amount of million 
thus  our current total availability under these two bank facilities is billion 
we currently have no amounts outstanding under these facilities 
the million facility matures on november  and can be extended days on each maturity date 
the million facility matures on november   and once a year  it can be extended for one additional year 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the million facility would be the prevailing libor plus  and the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the million facility would be the prevailing libor plus 
the facility fees for the million and the million facilities are and  respectively  of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit facilities would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating improves  the facility fees and interest rates would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities 
however  under 
table of contents these committed credit facilities  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  and set a minimum ratio of net worth to indebtedness 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was million and million outstanding at may  and may   respectively 
we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs 
dividends per share of common stock for fiscal were  the same as in fiscal we have paid a dividend every quarter since february we review our dividend policy from time to time  however  based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements  we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  production and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our japanese subsidiary 
we use forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration  which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies  japanese yen  canadian dollars  korean won  mexican pesos  australian dollars and new taiwan dollars 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  cross currency swaps  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

table of contents we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var calculation  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the reduction in var as of may  occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation 
such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above  are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described in the last paragraph of this section 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  cross currency swaps  and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
we have excluded the cross currency swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan 
we have included these cross currency swaps in the interest rate risk category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation 
for the cross currency swaps the table presents both the euro swap payable and us dollar swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates 
all information is presented in us dollar equivalents  in millions  except interest rates 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 
there was not a significant change in debt or cross currency swap market risks during fiscal the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was million at may   which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination 
the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may  was million 
table of contents versus a carrying value of million at that date 
the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt  the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may  were million  million and million  respectively  versus carrying values of million  million and million  respectively  at that date 
in august  we issued a million corporate bond maturing in august  with a fixed interest rate of 
in november  we entered into receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to this bond 
the interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million maturing in august the receive fixed rates on the swaps match the fixed rate on the bond  and the pay variable rates are based on the three month libor rates plus a spread 
as a result of the interest rate swap agreements  our effective interest rate on the million corporate bond was as of may  the difference between the carrying amounts and fair value of the corporate bond and related interest rate swaps was million at may  expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk euro functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency intercompany loans euro denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan japanese yen denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan canadian dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate argentine peso functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate
