item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in risk factors  business and elsewhere in this report 
overview we integrate global positioning system technology  wireless communications and the internet to enable companies to efficiently manage their mobile resources with location relevant and time sensitive information 
our service is an easy to use  cost effective  internet based service for mobile resource management that provides location  reporting  dispatch  messaging  and other management services 
our service allows customers to use our website to monitor the activities of their employees  vehicles and goods and services  and provides for two way messaging between our customers and their mobile workers 
our service also allows customers to conduct business operations such as event confirmation  signature verification and forms processing while in the field 
we believe our service provides significant value to our customers by reducing the costs and increasing the efficiency of their operations 
from july through june  our operations consisted primarily of various start up activities relating to our current business  including development of global positioning system technologies  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we did not recognize any revenues prior to june  and our expenses consisted of research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
in  we expanded our strategy and redirected our focus to provide location relevant and time sensitive information services and solutions to companies managing mobile resources 
in the second half of  we introduced fleetasap  a service that leverages existing infrastructure  including the global positioning system  wireless networks and the internet to enable companies to efficiently manage their mobile resources 
our service includes a proprietary hardware device embedded with software  our platform  that integrates wireless internet connectivity with a global positioning system receiver 
the platform is installed in any type of vehicle and receives signals transmitted from global positioning system satellites to determine the location  velocity and orientation of the vehicle 
these data are transmitted over wireless networks and the internet to our wireless applications processing center 
our customers can retrieve the information using an internet browser or wired or mobile telephone 
because the customer data and solution software reside at our wireless applications processing center  our customers do not need to make a substantial investment in acquiring and supporting capital equipment  such as proprietary hardware  software and data networking equipment  to use our service 
since  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our service and the associated product hardware 
our service revenue is composed of monthly fees 
our customers can contract to receive our service for terms of one  two or three years and can purchase enhanced service features for additional fees 
as more customers use our service  the impact on our service revenue is compounded 
our product revenue consists of sales of the internet location manager  the internet data terminal and ruggedized personal digital assistant 
we defer product revenue from our platform at installation and recognize it ratably over the minimum service contract period 
product costs not in excess of related product revenue are deferred at the time of shipment and amortized ratably over the minimum service contract period 
where the selling prices of our products are below our costs  we expense the difference at the time of shipment of the related products 
allowances for sales returns are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
we recognize revenue when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards including american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
our service is only available through use of our platform 
accordingly  service revenue is recognized ratably over the minimum service contract period  which commences upon the installation of the platform 
in addition  we defer product revenue from our platform at installation and recognize it ratably over the minimum service contract period 
allowances for sales returns are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
to date  we have not sold our service outside the us and canada  however  we intend to expand our service offerings to additional countries in the future 
we do not expect that revenues from international sales will be material in we will incur substantial stock compensation expense in current and future periods  which represents non cash charges incurred as a result of the issuance of stock options to employees and consultants 
the charge related to options granted to employees is recorded based on the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant  which is amortized over the option vesting period 
the charge related to options granted to consultants is calculated at the end of each reporting period using the black scholes model  which approximates fair value and is amortized based on the term of the consulting agreement or service period 
the amount of the charge in each period can fluctuate depending on our stock price and volatility 
see stock compensation expense 
since inception  we have invested substantially in research and development  marketing  the building of sales channels  and our overall infrastructure 
we anticipate that such investments will continue to grow in the near future 
we have incurred losses in each year since inception and expect to incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
even if we were to achieve profitability in any period  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods we use 
the following is a discussion of the more significant of these policies and methods 
revenue recognition in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  we recognize revenue when earned 
specifically  we recognize revenue when the price is fixed and determinable  upon persuasive evidence of an agreement  our fulfillment of our obligations under any such agreement and a determination that collection is probable 
our service is only available through the use of our platform 
accordingly  service revenue  which is composed of monthly fees  is recognized ratably over the minimum service contract period  which commences upon the installation of the platform 
our product revenue primarily consists of sales of the internet location manager  internet data terminal and ruggedized personal digital assistant 
we defer product revenue at installation and recognize it ratably over the minimum service contract  which is generally a two or three year period 
our service renewal rates are not considered to be priced at a bargain in comparison to the initial product selling prices as described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
changes to the pricing of our products and services in the future could result in the recognition of product revenue over periods that extend beyond the minimum service contract period 
allowances for sales returns are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
in  and to a lesser degree in  the selling prices of our products were often at or below our costs 
product costs not in excess of related product revenue are deferred at the time of shipment and amortized ratably over the minimum service contract period 
where the selling prices of our products are below our costs  we expense the difference at the time of shipment of the related products 
allowances for doubtful accounts historically  we have had a significant number of small to medium sized companies utilizing our products and services 
these customers are involved in diverse businesses 
our payment arrangements with customers generally provide day payment terms 
at the time that customers contract with us for our service  we assess their creditworthiness 
during economic downturns  certain of our customers may have difficulty with their cash flows 
the nature of our relationship with our customers is inherently long term and we may extend payment terms on an exception basis 
we regularly review our customers ability to satisfy their payment obligations and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for all specific receivables that we believe are not collectible 
when these conditions arise  we suspend recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable or cash is collected 
beyond these specific customer accounts  we record an allowance based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we have not established a specific allowance 
these allowances are based on our experience in collecting such accounts 
although we believe that we can make reliable estimates for doubtful accounts  the size and diversity of our customer base  as well as overall economic conditions  may affect our ability to accurately estimate revenue and bad debt expense 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
results of operations for the years ending december    and service revenue service revenue  which is composed of monthly fees  increased to million in from million and  in and  respectively  as a direct result of the growth in our installed base of subscribers 
the increase in subscriber base during  and is attributed to the release of our mobile resource management service 
initial product installation and service delivery began at the end of l the number of subscribers using our service totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
product revenue product revenue increased to million in from million and  in and  respectively  and is consistent with the growth in our installed base of subscribers and the commercial release of our service 
cost of service revenue cost of service revenue consists of employee salaries and expenses related to the delivery and support of our services  costs and expenses associated with connecting our services to wireless networks and the internet  and depreciation of our wireless applications processing center 
cost of service revenue increased to million in from million and  in and  respectively 
the increase in cost of service revenue resulted from the associated increase in service revenue and related information technology infrastructure and personnel costs 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the internet location manager  internet data terminal  ruggedized personal digital assistant  related parts  costs associated with the final assembly  test  provisioning  delivery and installation of our products and other costs such as provisions for inventory and repair costs 
in  and to a lesser degree in  the selling prices of our products were often at or below our costs 
product costs not in excess of related product revenue are deferred at the time of shipment and amortized ratably over the minimum service contract period 
where the selling prices of our products are below our costs  we expense the difference at the time of shipment of the related products 
generally  we expect the selling prices of our products to be approximately equal to or exceed the product costs in future periods 
the impact of selling products below costs on future cash flow from operations is expected to be minimal as our service revenue stream expands and is renewed 
cost of product revenue increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in cost of product revenue were attributed primarily to the commercial release of our service and the resulting increase in the number of subscribers using our service 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of employee salaries  sales commissions  and marketing and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases reflect personnel costs  expansion of sales channels and activities related to the development of market awareness of our services in and in  cost reductions associated with the reduction in force were offset as a result of average headcount levels being higher in sales and marketing headcount decreased to at december  from at december   as a result of a reduction in force undertaken in june sales and marketing headcount increased to at december  from at december  related increases in salaries and other compensation  sales commissions and marketing awareness campaigns comprised the majority of the increases in we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we expand our sales and marketing efforts and pay sales commissions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of employee salaries and expenses related to development personnel and consultants  as well as expenses associated with software and hardware development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decrease in headcount from at december  to at december  the decrease in headcount was primarily due to a reduction in force undertaken in june research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in was primarily attributed to headcount growth to at december  from at december  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs that are incurred during the application development stage and amortize them over the software s estimated useful life 
we capitalized approximately  and  of costs related to internally developed software systems in and  respectively 
during  no research and development costs were capitalized in accordance with sop general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of employee salaries and related expenses for executive and administrative  accounting and professional fees  recruiting and provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in to million was primarily due to increases in compensation resulting from a higher average headcount during  provision for doubtful accounts and insurance expenses 
the increase in was due to our growth in headcount  increases in our provision for doubtful accounts and costs of operating as a public company 
general and administrative headcount totaled  and at december    and  respectively 
restructuring charges during and in response to a general downturn in the economy  we undertook a formal plan to lower our cost structure 
we completed a reorganization to more effectively develop  market and sell mobile resource management products and services 
this effort resulted in the total number of employees being reduced by approximately percent 
restructuring expenses  which are composed severance and related costs  were  in  net of reversals 
intangibles amortization intangibles amortization relates to the intangible assets purchased from differential corrections  inc in april  which are being amortized over an estimated useful life of three years 
stock compensation expense deferred stock compensation related to the granting of stock options to employees and consultants was million as of december  stock compensation expense decreased to million in from million in and million in and represents the amortization of deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of related options granted in and interest income  net net interest income is composed primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
net interest income decreased to million in from million in due to lower balances available to invest and lower interest rates during compared to net interest income increased to million in from  in  due to investment in debt securities of the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock on september  and convertible preferred stock financings completed in june and december and january and june other expense  net in  other expense consisted primarily of net foreign exchange losses related to our subsidiary in india 
in  other expense is composed of amounts paid to underwriters for expenses not associated with the initial public offering  offset in part by gains on disposal of property and equipment 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and except for only minimum state income and franchise taxes have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
net loss net loss decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in revenue and its associated margins and reduced stock compensation and research and development expenses 
net loss increased to million in from million in as a result of costs associated with developing our technology  building our infrastructure and increasing installed subscriber base 
changing prices we conduct operations primarily within the us where inflation during  and has been low and has not materially impacted our operating results 
foreign currency exchange losses resulting from transactions with our wholly owned subsidiary in india  which began business in  were not material during  and and were expensed as incurred 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results for each of the eight quarters ended december  this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the operating results are not necessarily indicative of results of any future period

we currently have a million revolving line of credit facility against which there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding as of december  the line  against which letters of credit may be issued  is collateralized by a restricted certificate of deposit of million 
this credit facility expires in december net cash used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash used for operating activities was attributable primarily to net losses  an increase in inventory and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in and  cash used for operating activities was attributable primarily to net losses and increases in accounts receivable  inventory  and deferred product costs  offset in part by depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred stock compensation  increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and deferred revenues 
as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable were over days old 
we believe we have adequately provided allowances as of december  for any such amounts that may ultimately become uncollectible 
we defer product costs at time of shipment and expense any amounts in excess of the related product revenue at that time 
we record accounts receivable from our customers and defer related product revenue upon installation 
both deferred product costs and revenue are recognized ratably over the minimum service period 
deferred product costs are recorded at the time of shipment and deferred product revenue is recorded at the time of installation 
as a result  deferred product costs will generally exceed deferred product revenue as we grow our business 
at december   total deferred product costs of million exceeded total deferred product revenue by million  and included million related to products shipped but not yet installed 
net cash provided by investing activities in resulted from sales of short term investments of million  offset in part by purchases of equipment of  net cash used for investing activities in was million  primarily resulting from purchases of property and equipment of million  purchases of short term investments of million  cash paid for acquisitions of million and increases in other assets of million  offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
net cash used for investing activities in was million  primarily resulting from the purchase of restricted and unrestricted short term investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in each period was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of our stock 
our capital expenditures in were approximately  a decrease of million from and consistent with our anticipated needs in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  although we anticipate increases in capital expenditures and lease commitments with our expected growth in operations and infrastructure 
we also may establish additional operations as we expand globally 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for operating expenses  working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a larger credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  holders of these securities could have certain rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock  and the terms of this debt could restrict our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
we have adopted sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted sfas no 
as of january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are intended to be ones that are specific to us or our industry and that we deem material  but they are not the only ones that we face 
due to our limited operating history it is difficult to predict future operating results or our stock price 
an evaluation of our business is difficult because we have a limited operating history 
we commenced operations in july and commercially offered our first services in the second half of we may not achieve profitability or continue to grow 
we face a number of risks encountered by early stage companies in the global positioning system  wireless communications and internet information industries  including our need to introduce reliable and robust products and services that meet the demanding needs of customers  our need to expand our marketing  sales and support organizations  as well as our distribution channels  our ability to anticipate and respond to market competition and technological change  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our services  our need to manage expanding operations  our dependence on wireless carriers  limited coverage of wireless networks  and migration to new networks  which could cause our products to be incompatible or out of date 
our business strategy may not be successful  and we may not successfully address these risks 
we have historically incurred losses and these losses may increase in the future 
we have never been profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to become profitable and sustain profitability  we will need to generate significant revenues to offset our cost of revenues  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we may not achieve or sustain our revenue or profit goals and our losses may increase in the future 
in order to facilitate the sale of our services  we have sold and may sell our hardware below our costs 
as a result  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  negative gross margins on the sale of our hardware 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
if we do not increase revenue from the sale of our services to new and existing customers  our business may not be successful 
our success depends on our ability to increase revenue from the sale of our services to new and existing customers and on market acceptance of our services 
we may not be able to achieve widespread adoption of our services 
furthermore  changes such as increases in our pricing for products and services may harm our ability to increase sales of our products and services to new and existing customers 
if we are not able to expand our customer base and increase our revenue from new and existing customers  our business will be seriously harmed 
we depend on wireless networks owned and controlled by others 
if our customers do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our revenues could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability depends on the ability of wireless carriers to provide sufficient network capacity  reliability and security to our customers 
even where wireless carriers provide coverage to entire metropolitan areas  there are occasional lapses in coverage  for example due to tall buildings blocking the transmission of data to and from vehicles 
these effects could make our services less reliable and less useful  and customer satisfaction could suffer 
our financial condition could be seriously harmed if our wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services  or to suffer operational or technical failures 
if wireless carriers do not expand coverage  we may be unable to offer our service to additional areas 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  and our stock price may decline if we do not meet the expectations of investors and analysts 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to delays in market acceptance or implementation by customers of our services  changes in length of sales cycles of or demand by our customers for existing and additional services  changes in or cancellations of our agreements with wireless carriers  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  changes in our mix of sources of revenues  changes in the productivity of our distribution channels  changes in accounting standards  including standards relating to revenue recognition  business combinations and stock based compensation  wireless data and internet market conditions  and general economic and political conditions 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectation of future revenues 
additionally  a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed 
as a result  any shortfall in revenues relative to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenues and operating results to predict our future performance 
in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and  as a result  the price of our common stock may fall 
if one or more of the agreements we have with wireless carriers is terminated  we may be unable to offer our services to our customers within the carrier s coverage area 
wireless carriers offering services compatible with our service have little overlap in their primary service coverage areas 
our existing agreements with wireless carriers may be terminated upon as little as fifteen day written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of certain conditions 
if one or more of our wireless carriers decides to terminate or not to renew its contract with us  we may incur additional costs relating to obtaining alternate coverage from another wireless carrier outside of its primary coverage area  or we may be unable to replace the coverage at all  causing a complete loss of service to our customers in that coverage area 
our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our sales channels 
in order to increase our market awareness  customer base and revenues  we need to expand our direct and indirect sales operations 
there is strong competition for qualified sales personnel in our business  and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient new sales personnel to expand our operations 
new sales personnel will require training and will take time to achieve full productivity  if at all 
in addition  we believe that our success is dependent on expansion of our indirect distribution channels  including our relationships with wireless carriers  independent sales agents and distribution partners 
to date  we have relationships with a limited number of these wireless carriers  independent sales agents and distribution partners 
these sales channel partners require training in selling our products and services and it will take time for these partners to achieve productivity  if at all 
we may not be able to establish relationships with additional distributors on a timely basis  or at all 
our distributors  many of which are not engaged with us on an exclusive basis  may not devote adequate resources to promoting and selling our services 
we have limited resources and may be unable to manage our anticipated growth in operations 
if we fail to develop and maintain our services as we experience rapid growth  demand for our services could decrease  which would result in a decrease in our revenues 
our development and expansion have placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on our managerial  operational  and financial resources 
due to the limited deployment of our services  we are unable to assess our ability to grow the business and manage a substantially larger number of customers and additional services 
if we cannot deliver the features and functionality our customers demand  we will be unable to retain or attract new customers 
our success depends upon our ability to determine the features and functionality our customers demand and to design and implement services that meet their needs in an efficient manner 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully determine customer requirements or that our future services will adequately satisfy customer demands 
to date  the design of our services has been based on our internal efforts and feedback from our existing and potential customers 
in addition  we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new services and service enhancements 
if we cannot effectively deploy  maintain and enhance our services  our expenses may increase  we may not be able to recover our costs and our competitive position may be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply critical components for our services 
if these parties do not perform their obligations  we may be unable to find other suppliers or operate our business 
a subscriber requires an internet location manager to use our service 
to use our service with two way messaging  a subscriber requires an internet location manager and either an internet data terminal or a ruggedized personal digital assistant 
the internet location manager  which we install in each subscribing vehicle  determines the vehicle s location  velocity and orientation and gathers other information about the vehicle 
the internet data terminal  when installed in subscriber s vehicle  adds the incremental ability to send and receive messages to and from the vehicle 
we cannot be sure that alternative sources for key components used in the internet location manager and the internet data terminal will be available when needed  or if available  that these components will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
we rely on sole suppliers and manufacturers for a number of key components for these products and do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers and manufacturers 
our sole suppliers and manufacturers of key components include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  our sole manufacturer of global positioning system receiver chips  conexant systems formerly philsar electronics  our sole manufacturer of radio frequency chips  orient semiconductor electronics  our sole manufacturer of internet location managers  micronet  our sole supplier of internet data terminals  and symbol technologies  our sole supplier of ruggedized personal digital assistants 
additionally  our sole manufacturer of radio frequency chips  conexant systems  has notified us that it will discontinue manufacturing our radio frequency chips 
we believe that at the termination of our relationship with conexant systems  we will have sufficient quantities of radio frequency chips to meet our needs through we are in the process of qualifying alternative sources for this component 
we cannot be sure  however  that alternative sources of radio frequency chips will be available when needed  or if available  that the component will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if our agreements with these or other suppliers and manufacturers are terminated or expire  if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  or if the terms for supply of these products become commercially unreasonable  our search for additional or alternate suppliers and manufacturers could result in significant delays  added expense and our inability to maintain or expand our subscriber base 
any of these events could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources to provide our services and could harm our ability to compete effectively 
we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so would seriously harm our business 
because of the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete  our success depends on the continued services of our current executive officers and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with global positioning system  wireless communications and internet software expertise 
competition for qualified personnel in these industries is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
competitors and others have in the past  and may in the future  attempt to recruit our employees 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
we face competition from existing and potential competitors  which could reduce our market share and revenues 
the market for our services is competitive and is expected to become even more competitive in the future 
our customers choose our services primarily on the basis of the functionality  ease of use  quality  geographic coverage of our services and corporate financial strength 
if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas  competitive pressures may harm our business  resulting in a loss of market share and revenues 
our current and potential competitors include other providers of vehicle location services  such as qualcomm  whose omnitracs service uses satellite communication technology to manage fleets of trucks that travel long distances  other wireless internet companies  such as openwave  research in motion and aether systems  companies working on emergency solutions  such as true position  companies with solutions that integrate location  wireless communications and call centers  such as general motors  and companies that provide wireless  location relevant applications  such as signalsoft 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 
our services also compete with alternative means of communication between mobile workers and their managers  including wireless telephones  two way radios and pagers 
in addition  we expect that new competitors will enter the market for location relevant wireless information as businesses and consumers increasingly demand information when they are mobile 
furthermore  the widespread adoption of industry standards may make it easier for new market entrants or existing competitors to offer the services we offer or may offer in the future 
our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to secure and protect patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used to implement and operate our services in the us and in foreign countries 
in the event that a third party breaches the confidentiality provisions or other obligations in one or more of our agreements or misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property or the intellectual property licensed to us by third parties  our business would be seriously harmed 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality and other contractual provisions and agreements  and patent  copyright and trademark laws  which afford us only limited protection 
third parties may independently discover or invent competing technologies or reverse engineer our trade secrets  software or other technology 
furthermore  laws in some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us therefore  the measures we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
a disruption of our services due to accidental or intentional security breaches may harm our reputation  may cause a loss of revenues and increase our expenses 
unauthorized access  computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions could disrupt our information systems or communications networks 
we expect to incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches and to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
currently  the transmission of our customers proprietary information is not protected by encryption technology 
if a third party were to misappropriate our customers proprietary information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could seriously harm our revenues and result in the loss of customers 
system or network failures could reduce our sales  increase costs or result in liability claims and seriously harm our business 
any disruption to our services  information systems or communications networks or those of third parties could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time 
our services may not function properly if our systems fail  or if there is an interruption in the supply of power  or if there is an earthquake  fire  flood or other natural disaster  or an act of war or terrorism 
any disruption to our services could cause us to lose customers or revenue  or face litigation  customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business 
we currently do not have fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems in our principal facilities in fremont  california  which are on or near earthquake fault zones  and philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we depend on global positioning system technology owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to global positioning system technology and satellites  we will be unable to deliver our services and revenues will decrease 
our services rely on signals from global positioning system satellites built and maintained by the us department of defense 
global positioning system satellites and their ground support systems are subject to electronic and mechanical failures and sabotage 
if one or more satellites malfunction  there could be a substantial delay before they are repaired or replaced  if at all  and our services may cease and customer satisfaction would suffer 
in addition  the us government could decide not to continue to operate and maintain global positioning system satellites over a long period of time or to charge for the use of the global positioning system 
furthermore  because of ever increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system  other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals in the future 
if factors such as the foregoing affect the global positioning system  for example by affecting the availability and pricing of global positioning system technology  our business will suffer 
our global positioning system technology depends on the use of radio frequency spectrum controlled by others 
global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of radio frequency spectrum 
an international organization known as the international telecommunications union controls the assignment of spectrum 
if the international telecommunications union reallocates radio frequency spectrum  our services may become less useful or less reliable 
this would  in turn  harm our business 
in addition  emissions from mobile satellites and other equipment using other frequency bands may adversely affect the utility and reliability of our services 
defects or errors in our services could result in the cancellation or delays of our services  which would damage our reputation and harm our financial condition 
we must develop our services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing global positioning system  wireless communications and internet markets 
products and services that address these markets are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are introduced 
our services may not be free from errors or defects  which could result in the cancellation or disruption of our services or dissatisfaction of customers 
this would damage our reputation and result in lost revenues  diverted development resources  and increased service and warranty costs 
the reporting of inaccurate location relevant information could cause the loss of customers and expose us to legal liability 
the accurate reporting of location relevant information is critical to our customers businesses 
if we fail to accurately report location relevant information  we could lose customers  our reputation and ability to attract new customers could be harmed  and we could be exposed to legal liability 
we may not have insurance adequate to cover losses we may incur as a result of these inaccuracies 
claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to provide our services 
third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe their proprietary rights or assert other claims against us 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property or other claim against us grows 
any intellectual property or other claim  with or without merit  would be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from focusing on our core business 
as a result of such a dispute  we may have to pay damages  incur substantial legal fees  develop costly non infringing technology  if possible  or enter into license agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
this would increase our expenses and could decrease the functionality of our service  which would make our services less attractive to our current or potential customers 
we have agreed in some of our agreements  and may agree in the future  to indemnify other parties for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the proprietary rights of third parties 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs to us 
we may be subject to claims for damages related to errors and malfunctions of our hardware components or their installation 
a product liability claim could seriously harm our business because of the costs of defending against this type of lawsuit  diversion of employees time and attention  and potential damage to our reputation 
some of our agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
limitation of liability provisions contained in our agreements may not be enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
as a result  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of damages in settlement or upon the determination of any of these types of claims 
we may establish alliances or acquire technologies or companies in the future  which could result in the dilution of our stockholders and disruption of our business 
we are continually evaluating business alliances and external investments in technologies related to our business 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  businesses or products and strategic alliances entail numerous risks  any of which could materially harm our business in several ways  including diversion of management s attention from our core business objective and other business concerns  failure to integrate the acquired company into our pre existing business  potential loss of key employees from either our pre existing business or the acquired business  dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
some or all of these problems may result from current or future alliances  acquisitions or investments 
furthermore  we may not realize any value from these alliances  acquisitions or investments 
we may need and may not be able to obtain additional capital  which could prevent us from carrying out our business strategy 
we anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next months  including the expansion of sales and marketing and research and development programs during that period 
thereafter  we may require additional financing in an amount that we cannot determine at this time 
if our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate  we may be required to seek capital sooner than anticipated 
we may need to raise funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and may not be able to continue to fund our operations 
if our wireless carriers decide to abandon cellular digital packet data or integrated digital enhanced network technologies or do not continue to expand their cellular digital packet data or integrated digital enhanced network systems  we may be unable to deliver our services and our sales could decrease 
our services function only on cellular digital packet data networks or integrated digital enhanced networks 
these protocols cover only portions of the us and canada and may not gain widespread market acceptance 
if wireless carriers decide to abandon these protocols in favor of other types of wireless technology  we may not be able to provide our current services to our customers 
in addition  if wireless carriers do not expand their coverage areas  we will be unable to meet the needs of customers who wish to use our services outside the current coverage area 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in increased product costs and operating expenses 
we have suppliers and manufacturers that are located outside the us some transactions relating to supply and development agreements may be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could cause us to incur currency exchange costs 
in addition  some of our transactions denominated in us dollars may be subject to currency exchange rate risk 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
should there be a sustained increase in average exchange rates for the local currencies in these countries  our suppliers and manufacturers may request a price increase at the end of the contract period 
our business will be harmed if the demand for the services based on wireless communications does not grow 
the markets for wireless data services and related products and services are still emerging  and continued growth in demand for  and acceptance of  these services remains uncertain 
current barriers to market acceptance of these services include quality  functionality and ease of use 
we cannot be certain that these barriers will be overcome 
since the market for our services is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market or its growth rate 
our financial performance will depend in large part upon the continued demand for mobile resource management services through wireless technologies 
we cannot assure you that a sufficient volume of customers will demand these or other services based on these technologies 
if the market for wireless on line mobile resource management and other services grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our revenues may not grow 
if the use of the internet by businesses does not continue to grow  our business will be harmed 
our future success is dependent on continued growth in the use of the internet by businesses 
the use and acceptance of the internet by businesses may not increase for a number of reasons  including the cost and availability of internet access and concerns about privacy  security and reliability 
capacity constraints caused by growth in the use of the internet may impede further development of the internet to the extent that users experience delays  transmission errors and other difficulties 
if the necessary infrastructure  products  services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable and widespread commercial medium  we may not be able to grow our business 
government regulations and standards may harm our business and could increase our costs or reduce our opportunities to earn revenues 
in addition to regulations applicable to businesses in general  we may also be subject to direct regulation by governmental agencies  including the federal communications commission and department of defense 
these regulations may impose licensing requirements or safety standards  for example with respect to human exposure to electromagnetic radiation and signal leakage 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  provincial  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  wireless communications and global positioning system technology  including on line content  user privacy  taxation  access charges and liability for third party activities 
additionally  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as taxation on the use of wireless networks  intellectual property  libel  user privacy and property ownership  will be applied to our services 
the adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws may expose us to significant liabilities and additional operational requirements  which could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
wireless carriers who supply us with airtime are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission  and regulations that affect them could also increase our costs or limit the provision of our services 
our platform contains encryption technology whose export is restricted by law  which may slow our growth or result in significant costs 
the us government generally limits the export of encryption technology  which our services incorporate 
foreign countries may impose similar regulatory requirements 
if any export approval that we receive is revoked or modified  if our technology is unlawfully exported or if the us government adopts new legislation or regulations restricting export of our services and encryption technology  we may not be able to distribute our services to potential customers outside the us  which may seriously harm our business 
we may need to incur significant costs and divert resources to develop replacement technologies or may need to adopt inferior substitute technologies to satisfy these export restrictions 
these replacement or substitute technologies may not be the preferred security technologies of our customers  in which case our business may not grow 
in addition  we may suffer similar consequences if the laws of any other country limit the ability of third parties to sell encryption technologies to us 
our stock price is volatile  which may cause you to lose money and result in costly litigation that could divert our resources 
stock markets have recently experienced dramatic price and volume fluctuations  particularly for shares of technology companies 
these fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our common stock and cause you to lose some or all of your investment 
these fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
in addition  due to the technology intensive and emerging nature of our business  the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to announcements of technological or competitive developments  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  security breaches  and disposition of shares of our common stock held by large investors 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against that company 
a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and state law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
we have adopted a certificate of incorporation and bylaws  which in addition to state law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include the following establishing a classified board in which only a portion of the total board members will be elected at each annual meeting  authorizing the board to issue preferred stock  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we have adopted a certificate of incorporation that permits our board to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which means that our board could issue shares with special voting rights or other provisions that could deter a takeover 
in addition to delaying or preventing an acquisition  the issuance of a substantial number of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock and dilute existing stockholders 
a limited number of stockholders collectively continue to own a majority or our stock and may act  or prevent certain types of corporate actions  to the detriment of other stockholders 
our directors  officers and greater than percent stockholders own approximately percent of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders may  if they act together  exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of a majority of the directors and the determination of significant corporate actions 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments at december   we did not hold any available for sale securities 
foreign currency exchange we transact business primarily in us dollars 
we are subject  however  to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in those countries where we conduct business 
to date  the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our subsidiary in india are denominated in indian rupees 
this subsidiary was formed in november to perform research and development activities 
we hold fixed price agreements denominated in us dollars with key foreign based suppliers orient semiconductor electronics  in taiwan  manufactures the internet location manager  novatel  in canada  provides the modem for the internet location manager  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  in taiwan  manufactures our global positioning system receiver chips  conexant systems  in canada  manufactures our radio frequency chips  and micronet  in israel  supplies our internet data terminal 
should there be a sustained increase in average exchange rates for the local currency in any of the foregoing countries  our suppliers may request increased pricing on any new agreements 
if this were to occur for all of these currencies and with each of these suppliers  a percent increase in average exchange rates could increase our product costs by approximately percent 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we currently hedge any foreign currency exposure to offset the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
similarly  we do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our subsidiary in india
