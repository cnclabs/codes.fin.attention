the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations summary of operating results 
torchmark s management computes a classification of income called net operating income and uses it to evaluate the operating performance of the company 
it differs from net income as reported in the financial statements in that it excludes nonrecurring and nonoperating income or loss items 
these items are removed because they distort comparability of torchmark s core operations from period to period 
net operating income also excludes discontinued operations 
the following items were excluded from net income as reported in torchmark s financial statements in order to compute net operating income realized investment losses  net of tax  the nonrecurring loss from the redemption by torchmark of its monthly income preferred securities mips and its debt in in the amount of million net of tax and the gain from redemption of debt in of 
million net of tax  a one time gain on the sale of equipment included in other income in the after tax amount of million in  the effect of a required change in accounting principle which modified the accounting for an interest rate swap instrument  increasing net income in the after tax amount of million in  the effect of the required change to a new accounting principle revising the method for valuing certain asset backed security investments  which resulted in an after tax charge of million in  a one time charge relating to discontinued energy operations in in the amount of million  and a tax incurred related to the spin off of waddell reed  inc waddell reed in in the amount of million after tax 
the charge related to discontinued energy operations arose from litigation which was ongoing at the time of torchmark s divestiture of energy activities in this litigation was settled during and resulted in the charge 
more information concerning this matter is found in note commitments and contingencies beginning on page of this report 
additionally  in  torchmark entered into a life insurance marketing arrangement with a third party  discussed more fully under the caption life insurance on page of this report 
this agreement contained certain cash guarantees to the third party which were substantially determined to not be recoverable by torchmark based on test marketing results 
accordingly  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring after tax operating charge of million  or 
per diluted share in because this was an unusual one time operating charge  net operating income has been presented before the charge in order to maintain year to year operating comparability 
a reconciliation of net operating income to net income on a per diluted share basis is as follows reconciliation of per share net operating income to reported net income net operating income before nonrecurring operating charge nonrecurring operating charge

the changes in accounting principles are discussed in note changes in accounting principles in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
torchmark reports basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share are based on the average shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of torchmark s employee stock options for which the exercise price was lower than the market price during the year and the impact that their exercise would have on shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share differ from basic earnings per share in that they are influenced by changes in the market price of torchmark stock and the number of options outstanding 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to per share data in this report are on the basis of diluted shares 
a comparison of torchmark s basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows earnings and earnings per share dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data for the year ended december  net operating income before nonrecurring charge amount    per share basic diluted net operating income amount    per share basic diluted net income amount    per share basic diluted total revenues were billion in  an increase over revenues of billion

the following table is a summary of torchmark s net operating income 
insurance underwriting income is defined by torchmark management as premium income less net policy obligations  commissions  acquisition expenses  and insurance administrative expenses plus other income 
excess investment income is defined as tax equivalent net investment income reduced by the interest credited to net policy liabilities and financing costs 
financing costs include the interest on torchmark s debt and the dividends on its mips and trust preferred securities  less the reduction in financing costs effected by interest rate swaps on certain of these instruments

contributing to the growth in net operating income were gains in insurance underwriting income and excess investment income 
insurance underwriting income grew in to million  after having increased in excess investment income also grew in both periods 
the increase in excess investment income was due primarily to the decrease in financing costs brought about by the lower interest rate environment in and debt refinancings during the year 
the increase of in excess investment income was a result of the growth in net investment income

torchmark s core operations are segmented into insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
insurance underwriting operations are further segmented into life insurance  health insurance  and annuity product groups 
a detailed discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest segment in terms of revenue  with life premium representing of total premium in and with life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense representing of the total in life insurance premium rose in to billion from billion in life premium increased in from billion 
sales of life insurance  in terms of annualized premium  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
this compares with growth in sales over sales of million 
annualized premium in force is often indicative of future premium income over the near term 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   compared with billion at year end  an increase of 
annualized premium in force grew in from billion at year end annualized premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes single premium income and policy account charges 
life insurance products are marketed through a variety of distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium by distribution method during each of the three years ended december  life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total liberty national exclu sive agency    direct response    american income exclusive agency    united american independent agency    united american branch office agency    other    direct response marketing is conducted through direct mail  co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
this group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles  their parents  and other adults over age with face amounts of around  on average 
in addition to life insurance marketing  the direct response operation has promoted growth in some of torchmark s agent based distribution channels through marketing support 
this support includes providing sales leads and assisting in agent recruiting and has contributed indirectly to the growth in premium in other torchmark distribution agencies 
the direct response operation is characterized by lower acquisition costs than torchmark s agency based marketing systems 
it accounted for over of torchmark s life insurance premium during direct response life premium rose in to million 
direct response life premium was million in  increasing over premium of million 
direct response annualized life premium in force rose to million at december  from million a year earlier 
at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was of torchmark s total  the largest of any component distribution group 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew in sales of life insurance in terms of annualized premium issued for the direct response group were million in these sales represented a slight decline from million in in early  torchmark discontinued certain products in the direct response market in order to focus on sales of more profitable business 
the discontinuing of sales of these products resulted in the flattening of sales 
annualized premium sold in by the direct response operation increased over sales of million  due in part to a higher average premium per policy issued 
the annualized life premium issued by the direct response group represented of torchmark s total life sales in the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middle income markets in several southeastern states 
it represented torchmark s largest contribution to life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  although its proportion of the total has declined in each successive year 
liberty s life premium rose in to million  representing of torchmark s total life premium 
life premium in was million  an increase of over the prior year 
the annualized life premium in force of the liberty agency was million at year end  compared with million and million at year ends and  respectively 
liberty s annualized life premium in force represented of total life annualized premium in force at december  life premium sales for this agency  in terms of annualized premium issued  grew during to million  compared with growth in sales growth in the liberty agency is largely attributable to growth in the number of agents 
liberty s agent count increased from  at year end to  at year end  and then further increased another in to  agents 
ongoing agent recruitment efforts and training programs  which help to improve agent retention  have been responsible for the growth in this agency 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
the american income exclusive agency is a distribution system that focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
this agency was torchmark s fastest growing agency during  accounting for the largest growth in both life sales and annualized life premium in force among torchmark s distribution methods 
annualized life premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over premium in force of million 
annualized life premium in force rose in sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  rose in to million  compared with an increase of in to million 
this increase was in the turnaround in sales for this agency over the last three years was a result of the growth in the number of agents 
prior to and during early  this agency had suffered significant declines in its agent count 
at december   there were  american income agents 
however  changes in american income s marketing organization were implemented in to reverse the decline in the number of agents 
as a result  this agency has grown steadily since mid while an overall decline in agent count occurred in the year to  agents because of agent losses early in that year  the agent count rose in to  agents and further grew in to  agents 
american income s marketing organization continues to implement efforts to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
the american income agency contributed million of life insurance premium during  representing of torchmark s total 
the premium increased over premium of million  which in turn rose over the prior year 
the united american independent and branch office agencies together represented about of torchmark s total life premium in on a combined basis  life premium rose to million in after a increase in from million to million 
annualized life premium issued in was million  compared with million in in  these issues had increased over issues of million 
annualized life premium in force in was flat with the prior year at million but rose in from million 
torchmark s other life insurance distribution system consists of its military agency  united investors agency  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies 
prior to  united investors distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary  waddell reed 
torchmark spun off waddell reed in  and united investors terminated the waddell reed agency contract in however  some waddell reed agents have obtained personal appointments with united investors in order to continue to sell united investors life products 
life premium income from the other distribution category grew to million in and also to million in life premium income from the other group accounted for of torchmark s total life insurance premium income in the year annualized life premium in force grew in to million  after having increased to million in a major factor in the growth of premium income and in force premium relates to the high persistency associated with the military business 
annualized premium sold during in the other distribution category was million  a decline from both and sales which were million in each year 
in addition to life insurance sales  this distribution system has also engaged in the production of variable life collections 
in  collections were million  compared with collections of million  a decline of 
in  these collections rose over the prior year 
although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are indicative of growth in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through the policy account charges for insurance coverage and administration as the account balance grows 
at december   the variable life account balance was million

these products were marketed through torchmark s direct response operation  and required torchmark to guarantee specified compensation to reader s digest  regardless of marketing success 
test marketing began in the fourth quarter of the less than favorable results from these tests indicated that it would be unlikely that torchmark would recover the full amount of compensation guaranteed to reader s digest under the terms of the agreement 
as a result  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring operating charge of million in this charge represented million after tax or 
per diluted share 
during and  torchmark maintained its relationship with reader s digest and continued to use its subscriber lists in selective marketing of torchmark insurance products 
however  torchmark only incurred its normal solicitation costs on this business and had no further costs related to the guaranteed compensation 
torchmark terminated its relationship with readers digest in life insurance gross margins have been presented in the above table to remove the effect of the nonrecurring charge  which distort comparisons 
excluding this charge  gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense  increased in to million after having risen in to million 
as a percentage of life insurance premium  life insurance gross margins were in both and  but declined from in one factor in the decline in both and is the reduction in underwriting income margins for direct response 
as a percentage of premium  direct response underwriting income was in  compared with in and in as previously discussed  efforts are underway to discontinue the marketing of lower margin direct response business 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution method during each of the three years ended december  health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american branch office agency    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    direct response    health products sold by torchmark insurance companies include medicare supplement  cancer  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for and cancer

health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in thousands december  of of of amount total amount total amount total medicare supplement    cancer    other    total    premium for the health insurance segment increased to billion in  exceeding the billion milestone in health premium income for the first time 
health premium grew to million in and to million in annualized health premium in force grew to billion at december  over the previous year end balance of billion 
health premium in force rose during sales of health insurance  in terms of annualized premium issued  declined in to million  after having increased in to million 
health sales in rose to million 
the fluctuations in health sales are largely attributable to medicare supplement sales in each period 
medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american branch office agency and the united american independent agency 
health sales in both agencies grew significantly in and  but declined in the branch office agency sold million in annualized health premium in  million in  and million in these sales represent a increase in and a increase in  but a decline of in the united american independent agency had health annualized premium issued of million  million  and million in each of the years   and  respectively 
these sales represented increases of and in and  respectively  but a reduction of in from the prior year 
there are two major factors which contributed to these fluctuations in medicare supplement sales 
first  sales in recent years have been positively affected by the involuntary terminations of medicare health maintenance organization hmo members  causing these terminated members  or disenrollees  to seek medicare supplement coverage 
in  the number of disenrollees reached an unprecedented level 
in  however  these terminations were approximately half of those of the prior year 
second  medicare supplement sales faced increased premium rate pressure from competition in some markets as torchmark implemented premium rate increases on its medicare supplement policies more timely than some competitors 
rate increases are required to offset health cost inflation 
in addition to the increased competition  the number of producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined in as agents in some markets left for easier sales at those competitors whose medicare supplement products were priced lower than torchmark s 
prior to  this agency had experienced rapid growth in appointed agents  which contributed greatly to the growth in sales in these periods 
at the end of  however  the number of producing agents was  producing agents are those who have had a sale 
management believes that these competitive pressures will subside as competitors obtain rate increases  however  sales of medicare supplements during are expected to be somewhat less than for because new agents need to be recruited and trained  and fewer hmo disenrollees are expected 
although sales declined in  medicare supplement annualized premium in force at december  rose to million from million at the end of medicare supplement annualized premium increased in medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
however  they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay 
because of loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are less than on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer service and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
at one time  the primary competition for medicare supplement sales came from medicare hmos  the managed care alternative to traditional fee for service medicare which eliminated the need for a supplemental policy 
however  in the last few years  growing public dissatisfaction with managed care  increased medical cost inflation and increased federal government regulatory pressures on medicare hmo s have caused a number of hmo s to withdraw from the market  reducing that competition 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program cause the need for annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
in addition  congress and the federal administration have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program 
therefore  it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future 
however  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
cancer insurance premium in force was flat in at million  compared with growth in and growth in sales of this product rose in to million after having declined in to million from million of sales 
a portion of the growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been attributable to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs 
cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency 
this agency represented of torchmark s total cancer annualized premium in force at december  annualized premium in force for other health products grew in to million  after rising in to million 
other health sales rose in to million  after having increased in health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    policy obligations    required interest on reserves    net policy obligations

cancer product obligation ratios have increased in recent years primarily due to higher loss ratios experienced on a closed block of business 
management has actively sought timely and adequate premium rate increases from regulatory authorities to offset these cost increases and to maintain margins on this business 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
prior to  torchmark s annuities were sold primarily by the waddell reed sales force  which marketed united investors annuities and other products under a marketing agreement 
in  this sales force collected of torchmark s total annuity collections 
effective april   torchmark terminated the marketing agreement providing for the sale of torchmark s variable annuities by the waddell reed sales force 
waddell reed was a former subsidiary of torchmark which was spun off in and is no longer affiliated 
in addition to no longer marketing united investors products  waddell reed has been replacing united investors products with those of another carrier 
as a result  torchmark has experienced declines in annuity sales and deposit balances 
a successor underwriter to market the variable annuity products of united investors was appointed effective may  while torchmark is now distributing variable annuities through other broker dealers  it does not expect to emphasize the growth of this product line in the future 
in addition to the annuities marketed by the united investors agency  a small amount of fixed annuities are sold by the united american independent agency and the liberty national agency 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and  on fixed annuity policies  to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to the policy 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable       total       collections of fixed annuity premium were million in  compared with million in  a decrease 
fixed annuity premium collections declined in from million in the fixed annuity deposit balance declined to million at year end from million at year end it declined in the prior year from million at year end torchmark has experienced weaker sales as a result of the reduced sales force and its reduced emphasis of these products 
lower interest rates have also been a factor in the reduced collections as alternative investments and other products have become more attractive 
variable annuity collections declined in to million from million in the prior year 
variable collections rose from million in the variable annuity account balance declined in to billion at december  from billion at december  it increased in from billion at december  the introduction of a new product in had a positive influence on sales of variable annuities in spite of market weakness in that year 
however  the loss of the waddell reed sales force as well as weaker financial markets are believed to have been the primary cause of the decline in variable annuity sales in  with replacement activity by waddell reed and the weaker markets contributing greatly to the decline in the variable annuity deposit balance 
variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities

underwriting income rose from million in policy charges have risen in each period  increasing in and in growth in policy charges is primarily related to the growth in the size of the annuity account balance 
growth in deposit balances accounted for the growth in charges in however  in  the decline in policy charges related to the asset balance were more than offset by increased surrender charges 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income

it is defined as net investment income on a tax equivalent basis reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
excess investment income is increased in a number of ways an increase in investment yields over the rates credited to policyholders liabilities or in relationship to the rates applicable to torchmark debt  growth in invested assets in relation to policy liabilities and debt  and the efficient use of capital resources and cash flow 
net investment income grew to million in in  net investment income increased to million after having declined in on a tax equivalent basis  in which the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities  investment income rose in  after increasing in and declining in the increase was caused by the growth in mean invested assets  which rose during the year to billion 
mean invested assets are computed on the basis of book value 
average yield on the portfolio declined approximately basis points during to  as rates have generally declined on investments acquired during this period 
this decline in yield partially offset the benefit to net investment income from the larger asset base 
the increase in investment income resulted from a combination of the growth in mean invested assets and an increase in yield 
mean invested assets rose to billion in over the prior year 
higher interest rates in financial markets caused yields on the portfolio to rise basis points in to 
new cash flow was invested primarily in taxable fixed maturities in both and the mean fixed maturity balance rose million or to billion in and million or in the growth in mean invested assets was achieved in both and even though million and million were used to buy torchmark stock in and  respectively 
additionally  million was used to pay down long and short term debt in excess investment income increased in after having increased in both and because of the effect of repurchases of torchmark stock  excess investment income on a per share basis increased in and in the growth in excess investment income of million was due in large part to the reductions in financing costs brought about through the lower interest rate environment and the call of the mips during the year 
the increase in tax equivalent investment income due to the growth in the invested asset base was also a contributing factor 
the increase in excess investment income in correlated closely with the change in tax equivalent investment income for the same period 
during  torchmark entered into two transactions to dispose of the majority of its investment real estate 
torchmark had previously determined to divest itself of investment real estate operations because yields obtained on alternative investments such as fixed maturities were significantly greater 
total consideration for the combined transactions was million of which million was cash 
the real estate dispositions resulted in an after tax loss of million 
after the sales  torchmark retained million in investment real estate  of which million was represented by properties partially occupied by torchmark subsidiaries 
at december   torchmark held million in investment real estate 
one of the transactions involved sales to elgin development company and other investors for total consideration of million  of which million was cash and the balance was in a ten year collateralized note 
torchmark s loss associated with this transaction was million after tax 
at the time of the transaction  the chairman of the executive committee of torchmark was a one third investor in elgin development company 
his total investment in elgin development was approximately million 
the outstanding balance of the collateralized note with elgin development company was million at december  for more information on this matter refer to transactions with related parties on page of this report 
during  torchmark adopted a new accounting principle  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets eitf  which changed the method of accounting for certain of its asset backed securities 
as a result of the requirements of the new principle  torchmark wrote these investments down million  or million net of tax  which has been reported as a change in accounting principle 
future impairment of these assets will be reported as realized investment losses 
subsequent to the adoption of the new rule  an additional impairment loss of million after tax was recorded 
additionally  certain of the asset based securities were sold during for proceeds of million at a loss of thousand after tax 
at year end  million at market value of asset backed securities were held subject to eitf for more information on this new accounting rule  see note changes in accounting principles in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
the yield curve represents the difference between long and short term rates on government securities of different maturities 
when the curve is flat or inverted  higher returns on new investments are generally available with shorter maturities 
when the curve is positive  longer maturities must be sought to obtain higher returns 
in  when the yield curve was relatively flat  higher returns were possible in spite of a shortening of maturities 
during  the slightly inverted yield curve which opened the year was replaced with a positively sloping yield curve by year end 
in this environment  attaining desired yields on permanent investments required the extension of maturities 
for this reason  torchmark made acquisitions with longer maturities in the average life of purchases was years  compared with years in and years in in  new investments in fixed maturities totaled billion  compared with billion in and billion in acquisitions in were made at an effective compounded yield of  compared with an effective compounded yield of in and in these yields equate to nominal yields on acquisition of  and  respectively  for   and the amount of fixed maturity acquisitions varied by year  primarily due to tax motivated sales activity in all years and particularly the investment of the million proceeds from the sale of real estate holdings in even though the average life of new investments increased significantly in  the average life of the entire portfolio remained rather stable 
the average life of the portfolio was years at year end  years at year end  and years at year end portfolio adjustments taken during resulted in sufficient realized tax gains to enable torchmark to offset completely its tax loss carry forward which originated in and carried through to sales of fixed maturities for tax and other purposes in resulted in a pre tax realized loss of million 
however  realized gains  principally through the change in value of torchmark s fixed to floating swaps  reduced the net loss to million 
in  million of capital losses were offset by a million gain on the swap and other investments 
in  losses of fixed maturities were million 
however  these losses were compounded by an million reduction in swap value and a million loss on the sale of real estate for a total realized investment loss of million 
torchmark s emphasis continues to be on marketable  high quality fixed maturity investments 
while yields have fluctuated somewhat  the nominal yield on the billion portfolio remained at during  equal to the level and above the level 
at december   approximately of invested assets were fixed maturity securities  and of these holdings were classified investment grade by the rating agencies 
the national association of insurance commissioners considers of the portfolio investment grade 
the fixed maturity portfolio s value fluctuates with changes in interest rates  and the unrealized loss in the portfolio was million at year end this compares with an unrealized loss of million at year end and an unrealized loss of million at the end of the distribution of maturities is as follows short terms and under year years years years years over years with a preference for bond investments over investments in equities  mortgages  or real estate holdings  the relative percentage of torchmark s investments by type is inconsistent with industry data 
the following table presents torchmark s components of invested assets with the latest industry data torchmark amount industry in thousands bonds short terms  equities mortgage loans  real estate

latest data available from the american council of life insurance 
market risk sensitivity 
market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed maturity holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to market 
the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion and debt and preferred securities were 
billion at december   compared with fixed maturity investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  insurance liabilities and debt are not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
a significant change in the level of interest rates  changes in credit quality of individual securities  or changes in the relative values of a security or asset sector are the primary factors that influence such sales 
sales are also influenced by tax regulations 
occasionally  the need to raise cash for various operating commitments may also necessitate the sale of a security 
volatility in the value of torchmark s fixed maturity holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively short term portfolio  of which matures within five years and of which matures within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
interest rate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its preferred stock and certain debt issues as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report and in capital resources beginning on page of this report 
the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below amounts guaranteed 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
those procedures indicate that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and december  this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in at at basis december  december  points financial condition liquidity 
torchmark s liquidity provides it with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is evidenced by its three sources of liquidity its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of marketable securities  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in and million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments during  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and other corporate uses 
while torchmark s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect liquidity 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end in addition to these highly liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities  which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark entered into a line of credit facility with a group of lenders in november  which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
the facility is split into two parts a million day tranche maturing november  and a million five year tranche maturing november  the company has the ability to request up to million in letters of credit to be issued against the million five year tranche 
under either tranche  interest is charged at variable rates 
the line of credit is further designated as a back up credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time  with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed million 
commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit on a combined basis may not exceed million 
at december   million face amount of commercial paper was outstanding  million letters of credit were issued  and there were no borrowings under the line of credit 
a facility fee is charged on the entire million facility 
the facility has no ratings based acceleration triggers which would require early repayment 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
these requirements have declined in both and from the respective prior year 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis  or of surplus  in the absence of special approval 
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
during the year  a maximum amount of million is expected to be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of long and short term debt  preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
torchmark s debt consists of its funded debt and its commercial paper facility 
an analysis of torchmark s funded debt outstanding at year ends and on the basis of par value is as follows principal principal year amount amount instrument due rate thousands thousands senior debentures   notes   notes   senior notes  total funded debt   the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
torchmark issued million principal amount of senior notes in december  these notes will mature on december  and may not be redeemed prior to maturity 
there is no sinking fund requirement 
interest is payable semi annually on june and december these notes are unsecured and rank equally with torchmark s other unsecured indebtedness 
proceeds from the issuance  after underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering  were approximately million 
proceeds were used initially to pay down short term debt 
in connection with this issuance  torchmark entered into a five year swap agreement with an unaffiliated party to swap the fixed rate payment obligation for a floating rate obligation 
the floating rate is based on the six month libor and resets every six months 
at december   the floating rate was 
this swap derivative qualifies as a hedge under accounting rules 
therefore  changes in its market value will be substantially offset by changes in the value of the debt security 
torchmark s derivative instruments are classified as other invested assets 
during and  torchmark acquired a portion of its funded debt in the open market through its insurance subsidiaries 
in  million principal amount of its notes due was acquired at a cost of million 
also in  million principal amount of its notes due was purchased for million 
insurance company holdings in the funded debt reduce consolidated debt outstanding 
in  all of the debt previously acquired by insurance subsidiaries was acquired from those subsidiaries by the parent company 
additionally  another million principal amount of the notes and million principal amount of the notes were acquired by torchmark in at a cost of million and million  respectively 
the redemption of this debt in resulted in an after tax gain of thousand 
in  million par value of the notes was acquired by torchmark at a cost of million  resulting in an after tax loss of thousand 
in november   torchmark established two capital trusts which in turn sold trust preferred securities in a public offering 
capital trust i sold million shares and capital trust ii sold million shares 
the trust preferreds sold in the two offerings have similar terms 
each offering consisted of trust preferreds at a liquidation amount of per security  resulting in an aggregate liquidation amount of million 
they are redeemable at torchmark s option in part or whole at any time on or after november  they are subject to a mandatory redemption on november  distributions are cumulative and are paid quarterly at an annual rate of  or at a rate of per share 
all payments by the trusts regarding the trust preferreds are guaranteed by torchmark 
the capital trusts are wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of torchmark 
the two offerings resulted in proceeds to the capital trusts of million  after underwriters discount and issue expenses 
the capital trusts in turn used the proceeds to buy junior subordinated debentures from torchmark in like amount 
torchmark used these proceeds to redeem its remaining outstanding mips in the approximate amount of million  with the remaining proceeds used to pay down short term debt 
the mips were redeemed november  in conjunction with the offering of the trust preferred securities  torchmark entered into a ten year swap agreement to replace the fixed distribution obligation with a floating rate payment 
the floating rate is based on the three month libor and resets each quarter when the distributions are made 
at december   the variable rate was 
this swap derivative does not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and will be carried on the balance sheet at market value 
at december   this swap had no value 
the mips were originally issued in at a redemption amount of million with a monthly dividend based on an annual rate of 
the mips were redeemable at torchmark s option at any time after september  at the full redemption amount of per share 
torchmark elected to redeem the mips in full during in three transactions which resulted in an after tax loss on redemption of million 
funds to repay million of the principal amount were derived from the issuance of the trust preferred securities in november   while the remaining million balance was redeemed using corporate cash flow or by short term borrowings earlier in the year 
torchmark has in place a swap agreement originally entered into when the mips were issued to exchange a monthly fixed payment based on an annual rate of for a floating rate based on the one month libor rate on a notional amount of million 
while the mips have been redeemed  the swap is still in place and does not expire until september  at december   torchmark was obligated to pay at a floating rate of on this agreement  while collecting at a rate of 
torchmark s after tax earnings benefited million in  million in  and million in because of this swap agreement 
effective january   torchmark changed its method of accounting for the swap agreement on the mips to recognize changes in its fair value  net of tax  as realized investment gains or losses 
this method of accounting for such instruments was believed to be preferable under the guidance established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for futures contracts sfas and the securities and exchange commission 
previously  torchmark accounted for the swap using hedge accounting under sfas the after tax cumulative effect of the change at january  was a gain of million net of income taxes of million 
the effect of the change on the twelve months ended december  was to increase realized losses by million 
per diluted share  excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
market value of the swap  which is included as a component of other invested assets  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
short term debt consists of torchmark s commercial paper outstanding 
the commercial paper balance outstanding at december  was million at carrying value  compared with a balance of million a year earlier 
the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s current cash needs 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december  in the computation of this ratio  the preferred securities outstanding are counted as equity and the effect of fluctuations in security values based on changes in interest rates in financial markets are excluded 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end the decline in the debt to capitalization ratio at year end was caused primarily by short term debt paydowns 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements was in  compared with in and in torchmark s interest expense declined to million in  primarily as a result of much lower interest rates in financial markets and a reduction in average debt outstanding 
interest expense rose to million in the increase in was due primarily to an increase in short term borrowing costs which offset the lower amount of average debt outstanding 
torchmark continues to make share purchases from time to time under its share repurchase program in the open market when market conditions are favorable 
in  torchmark acquired million shares on the open market at a cost of million 
torchmark purchased million shares at a cost of million in and million shares at a cost of million in torchmark plans to continue to make share purchases when prices are attractive 
share purchases could have a favorable impact on earnings per share and return on equity but could cause a reduction in book value per share 
in each of the years  and  torchmark executed stock option exercise and restoration programs in which torchmark employees and directors exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of new options at the current market price 
while these programs resulted in the issuance of new shares  a substantial portion of the new shares were sold immediately by the participants in the open market to cover the cost of the purchased shares and the related minimum taxes 
as a result of these restoration programs  management s ownership interest increased  and torchmark received a significant current tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
the program was conducted for two executives not able to participate in the program 
the following table presents key information about the programs 
august  december  november  exercise date number of participants shares issued thousands   shares sold thousands   new options thousands   shareholders equity rose to billion at december  shareholders equity increased in  from billion at year end to billion at year end book value per share was at year end  compared with at year end after adjusting for the impact on shareholders equity for security value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in financial markets  shareholders equity rose from billion at year end to billion at year end to billion at year end book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end book value per share rose in from at year end the increases in adjusted book value and book value per share in each period resulted primarily from the addition of earnings and were achieved in spite of the torchmark share purchases of million in and million in return on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in and in the return on equity ratios exclude the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in security values caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
they are also computed on a basis of net operating income before nonrecurring charge  as defined on page of this report

total may be increased or reduced by the effect of interest rate swaps 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material

as discussed under the caption investments on page of this report  torchmark decided to divest itself of its real estate operations because yields that could be obtained on alternative investments were significantly greater 
during and early  efforts were made to market these properties  and as a result  the majority of its properties were disposed of in two transactions in one of these transactions involved elgin development company  of which r

the goodwill balance will be frozen and not amortized 
torchmark s insurance intangibles are subject to recoverability testing under previously issued accounting rules 
there are no other significant intangible assets 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
is effective for torchmark beginning january  it requires one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
it retains previous requirements regarding the impairment of long lived assets 
it is not anticipated that this statement will have a material impact on torchmark 
critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  torchmark s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments many years into the future 
the liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of torchmark s insurance subsidiaries expected benefit payments  net of the related present value of future net premium collections 
it is determined by standard actuarial procedures  using assumptions as to mortality life expectancy  morbidity health expectancy  persistency  and interest rates  which are based on torchmark s subsidiaries previous experience with similar products 
for the majority of torchmark s insurance products  the assumptions used were those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies were issued 
an additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed 
for insurance products considered to be interest sensitive or deposit balance type products  the assumptions are monitored on a regular basis and modified when it is determined that actual experience is different from that previously assumed 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark s ultimate obligation 
additionally  significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts 
a complete list of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefits reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements found on page of this report 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and the other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased 
deferred acquisition costs are amortized with interest in a systematic manner which matches these costs against the associated revenues 
the assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest  mortality  morbidity  and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits 
for interest sensitive and deposit balance type products  these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations 
deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing 
these tests ensure that the present value of future contract related cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost balance 
these cash flows consist primarily of premium income  less maintenance expenses taking inflation into account 
the present value of these cash flows  less the benefit reserve  is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance 
in the event the asset balance is greater  this deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note significant accounting policies and note deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages and of this report  respectively 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims currently expected to be payable but which have not been submitted 
the estimate of unsubmitted claims is based on prior experience 
torchmark management makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the company 
however  there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  will be torchmark s ultimate obligations 
revenue recognition 
premium income for torchmark s subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as torchmark s annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched against revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned less investment expenses 
the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products 
torchmark benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and the interest on its debt 
during  the yield on the investment portfolio exceeded the weighted average contractual interest requirement by basis points 
torchmark will continue to be required to provide for future contractual obligations in the event of a decline in investment yield
