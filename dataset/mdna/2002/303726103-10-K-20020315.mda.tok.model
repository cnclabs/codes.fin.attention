item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a leading designer  manufacturer and supplier of analog  discrete  interface and logic  non volatile memory and optoelectronic semiconductors serving the personal computer  industrial  communications  consumer electronics and automotive markets 
the original fairchild semiconductor was renowned as one of the pioneering companies of the semiconductor industry 
it invented the planar process of manufacturing semiconductors  regarded as one of the most significant achievements in the semiconductor industry since the invention of the transistor 
these early innovations form the base of a rich company history 
fiscal year change during  we changed our fiscal year end from the last sunday in may to the last sunday in december 
our last fiscal year under our old accounting calendar was the year ended may   which we refer to as fiscal our first fiscal year following this change was the year ended december   which we refer to as calendar we sometimes refer to the transition period from may  to december  as stub year segment information the following table sets forth the composition of trade revenue by reportable segments and contract manufacturing services as a percentage of total revenues  excluding one time charges in fiscal and the twelve months ended december   which we refer to as calendar  totaling million in other revenues 
excluded from other revenues in calendar is a gain of million resulting from the adjustment of distributor reserves originally recorded in connection with the memory division restructuring 
calendar fiscal stub year analog discrete interface logic other subtotal net sales trade contract manufacturing services total year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations 
we generated a net loss of million for the year ended december   which we refer to as calendar  compared to net income of million in calendar excluding unusual charges gains and amortization of acquisition related intangibles  net of tax effects  pro forma net income was as follows for calendar and calendar  respectively calendar calendar in millions net income loss restructuring and impairments purchased in process research and development non recurring gains charges write off of equity investment non recurring release of deferred tax asset valuation allowance amortization of acquisition related intangibles less associated tax effects pro forma net income for calendar  restructuring and impairments included million of employee separation costs related to severance and other costs associated with work force reduction actions  and an million charge for asset impairments relating to the consolidation of the five inch wafer fabrication line in south portland  maine

gross profit was as follows for fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal in millions trade gross profit contract manufacturing gross profit total gross profit gross trade profit in fiscal was negatively impacted by one time charges of million for additional sales and inventory reserves as a result of the memory restructuring action 
excluding one time charges  gross profit decreased to million in fiscal excluding one time charges  gross trade profit as a percentage of trade sales was in fiscal the decrease in gross trade profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower average trade selling prices and the negative effects of significantly decreased demand from national semiconductor 
contract manufacturing gross profit decreased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in contract manufacturing gross profit as a percent of contract manufacturing revenues is due to the negative effects of lower factory utilization due to reduced demand from national semiconductor and an unfavorable sales mix toward abic wafers produced in our six inch fab in south portland  maine 
research and development 
r d expenses were million  or of trade sales in fiscal  compared to million  or of trade sales in fiscal the increase in r d expenses is due to the addition of the r d expenses of the power device business and a full year of analog r d expenses in fiscal  as compared to five months of analog r d expenses recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses were million  or of trade sales in fiscal  compared to million or of trade sales in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses is due to the addition of the sg a expenses of the power device business  a full year of analog sg a expenses in fiscal  as compared to five months of analog sg a expenses recorded in fiscal amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in amortization was a result of a full year of amortization for the raytheon acquisition in fiscal compared to five months in fiscal purchased in process research and development 
ipr d was million in fiscal this was derived from the acquisition of the power device business of samsung electronics 
ipr d of million for calendar represents the amount derived from the acquisition of the raytheon semiconductor business 
further information regarding our ipr d for significant acquisitions  including information on our significant assumptions  is addressed below under in process research and development 
restructuring and impairments 
fiscal included restructuring charges of million  as we took several actions during fiscal to reduce costs and improve profitability in a number of areas 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took a pre tax charge of million for actions to improve the profitability of the memory products group 
these actions include transferring wafer fabrication activities in salt lake city  utah to third party subcontractors and obsoleting memory product lines 
the charge consists of million for non cash asset impairments at our facilities in salt lake city  utah and sunnyvale  california  and million for severance and employee separation costs 
in addition  we took charges of million and million recorded to revenue and cost of sales  respectively  for additional sales and inventory reserves 
including these charges  the total charge for the memory restructuring was million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took a pre tax charge of million for the closure of our mountain view facility  which supports the analog products group 
we transferred analog wafer fabrication activities to our facility in south portland  maine 
the charge consists of million for severance and employee separation costs  million for non cash asset impairments  including a one time loss for the sale of the mountain view facility of million and million in other exit costs 
in march  we sold the facility for million  net of closing costs  million in escrow to cover demolition costs  and a million holdback  payment of which is contingent upon either favorable action or no action within one year of the sale date by the city of mountain view with respect to the buyer s application to increase the building density on the site 
we view the holdback as a contingent gain  and as such did not record this amount in the statement of operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we took a pre tax charge of million for the transfer of analog assembly and test activities from its mountain view facility to our facility in penang  malaysia and various third party subcontractors 
the charge consisted of million for non cash asset impairments and million for severance and employee separation costs 
total charges for analog restructuring activities  including the loss on sale of the mountain view facility  were million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we took a pre tax restructuring charge of million in connection with a plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the charge consisted of million for severance and employee separation costs related to the reduction of approximately salaried  hourly and temporary positions in the united states and cebu  the philippines  representing approximately of our payroll 
in addition  million was recorded for the write off of various idle assets in our mountain view and salt lake city facilities 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to the write off of deferred financing fees of million in connection with the refinancing of its senior credit facilities as part of the acquisition of the power device business  incremental interest expense as a result of additional indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition  a full year of interest expense on borrowings to finance the raytheon acquisition  as compared to five months in fiscal and interest expense on short term borrowings in fiscal which did not occur in fiscal interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease is due to lower average cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes 
income tax expense benefit was a benefit of million in fiscal  compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective rate is due to our inability to carry back our fiscal operating loss due to the short time we have operated as a stand alone entity and a tax holiday for income generated by our korean subsidiary  fairchild korea semiconductor ltd  formed as a result of the acquisition of the power device business 
fairchild korea semiconductor ltd 
has been granted a ten year tax holiday 
the first seven years are tax free  followed by three years of income taxes at of the statutory rate 
comparative financial information for our reportable segments is as follows analog and mixed signal products group 
analog revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal includes the analog revenues of the power device business since the date of acquisition 
fiscal includes revenues of analog from the acquisition date of raytheon 
normalized to exclude power device products and the non comparable period of analog sales in fiscal  analog revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal the decrease for the comparable period in fiscal from fiscal is due to revenue decreases in its mature products  combined with lower than anticipated new product revenues 
analog generated an operating loss of million in fiscal excluding restructuring charges  compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding the effect of the power device business and normalized for the non comparable period of analog operating results in fiscal  analog generated an operating loss of million in fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily driven by the decline in revenues 
discrete products group 
discrete revenues increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fiscal includes the discrete revenues of the power device business since the date of acquisition 
excluding discrete power device products  discrete revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease is attributable to lower revenues for its mature bipolar products  which decreased from fiscal  partially offset by higher revenues for its dmos products  which increased from fiscal discrete generated operating income of million in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding the effect of the power device business  discrete generated operating income of million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower gross profit as a result of unfavorable sales mix  the negative effect of underutilization of the salt lake city fab  and inventory write downs in the cebu  the philippines assembly and test facility 
interface and logic products group 
price competition was particularly intense in interface and logic in fiscal interface and logic revenues decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal revenues for interface products grew in fiscal over fiscal  due to success of new product introductions 
this increase was more than offset by a decrease in logic products revenues 
the decrease in logic products revenues is primarily attributable to lower bipolar logic revenues  which decreased from fiscal cmos revenues decreased in fiscal over fiscal overall  new product revenues doubled in fiscal over fiscal interface and logic generated operating income of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in operating income is attributable to lower average selling prices due to soft market conditions in fiscal in process research and development the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of ipr d for our significant acquisitions estimated weighted cost to average ipr d complete discount cost of charge technology rate capital dollars in millions calendar dpp fiscal power device business amounts charged to ipr d represent the estimated fair value based upon risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the respective dates of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly these costs were expensed at the acquisition dates 
acquisition of dpp 
the acquisition of dpp added breadth to our power discrete products portfolio  including mosfet s  igbt s and rectifiers 
the acquisition also gave us an expanded presence in the automotive and industrial markets 
one project  v n channel trench  out of six valued  accounted for approximately of the total ipr d charge and was approximately complete at the date of acquisition 
this project was completed on schedule in acquisition of the power device business 
the acquisition of the power device business greatly expanded our portfolio of power discrete and analog products  including mosfet s  igbt s  power transistors  standard linear products  motor control integrated circuits and power switch modules 
the acquisition also further expanded our market presence in asia and provided us an entry into the korean market 
three projects out of seven valued accounted for approximately of the total ipr d charge 
these projects samsung power switch  motor ic and igbt  were  and complete  respectively  as of the date of acquisition 
these projects have been completed 
the methodology used to assign value to purchased in process research and development was the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset  which is measured by calculating the discounted present value of the net after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this approach relies on forecasts provided by management for revenues and operating expenses such as cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses for the in process projects 
the forecasts used by us in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the dates of acquisition  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales or profits  or events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
as of december   revenue for the major dpp project was ahead of forecast 
revenues for the major power device projects were lower than forecast 
overall  the power device business revenues are meeting projections  due to higher than forecast revenues from products already developed at the acquisition date 
the lower revenues on in process power device products as compared to forecast have not had  nor are expected to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial position  including the recoverability of intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have a borrowing capacity of million on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  under our senior credit facility 
at december   adjusted for outstanding letters of credit  we had million available under this senior credit facility 
in connection with the financing of the dpp acquisition  on january   we completed a private offering of million of senior subordinated notes at face value 
interest on these notes is paid semi annually on february and august of each year  and the first interest payment was made august  we may redeem the notes on or after february  prior to february   we may redeem up to of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
on october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due november  the notes are unsecured obligations  and are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes rank on a parity with our existing senior subordinated debt and are and will be subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness  including any indebtedness incurred under the senior credit facility 
the notes are issued by fairchild semiconductor corporation and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by fairchild international and its other us subsidiaries and are convertible into the common stock of fairchild international 
our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future  may impose on us various restrictions and covenants which could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the restrictive covenants include limitations on consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  restrictions on creating liens  restrictions on paying dividends or making other similar restricted payments  restrictions on asset sales  restrictions on capital expenditures and limitations on incurring indebtedness  among other restrictions 
the covenants in the senior credit facility relating to financial ratios also include a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
provided there are no further outstanding balances under the senior credit facility  compliance with these ratios is not required until march  the senior credit facility also limits our ability to modify our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  or enter into shareholder agreements  voting trusts or similar arrangements 
under our debt instruments  the subsidiaries of fairchild semiconductor corporation cannot be restricted  except to a limited extent  from paying dividends or making advances to fairchild semiconductor corporation 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with existing cash  will be sufficient to meet our debt obligations over the next twelve months 
we expect that existing cash and available funds from our senior credit facility and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements and to fund our research and development and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we had capital expenditures of approximately million in to expand capacity primarily in support of in sourcing and our e business initiatives 
we frequently evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional borrowing or equity investment may be required to fund future acquisitions 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million from december  during calendar  our operations provided million in cash compared to million of cash in calendar the decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the decrease in net income in calendar compared to calendar cash used in investing activities during calendar totaled million  compared to million in calendar the increase in cash used in investing activities was the result of a decrease in capital expenditures  offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities of million for calendar was primarily from the issuance of million notes during the first quarter and million of notes during the fourth quarter of cash provided by financing activities of million in calendar was primarily from the issuance of common stock in our follow on public offering in january it is customary practice in the semiconductor industry to enter into guaranteed purchase commitments or take or pay arrangements for purchases of certain equipment and raw materials 
at december   obligations under these arrangements were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
the table below summarizes aggregate maturities of long term debt and future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt  operating leases total  liquidity and capital resources of fairchild international  excluding our subsidiaries fairchild international is a holding company  the principal asset of which is the stock of its sole subsidiary  fairchild semiconductor corporation 
fairchild international on a stand alone basis has no cash flow from operations 
fairchild international on a stand alone basis has no cash requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based in this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  sales reserves  inventory valuation and the impairment of long lived assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to customer sales allowances  product returns  bad debts  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  restructuring reserves and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if our management made different judgements or utilized different estimates 
revenue from the sale of semiconductor products is recognized when title transfers to the customer  including distributors  which is generally upon shipment 
no revenue is recognized unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
contract manufacturing revenues are recognized upon completion of the contracted service 
sales reserves generally fall into four categories customer material return reserves  distributor contract sales debit reserves  prompt payment discount reserves  and other distribution reserves 
customer material returns result from product quality  administrative or other defect issues 
distributor contract sales debits are credits given to distributors to ensure distributor profitability on individual resale transactions 
prompt payment discounts are enticements given to customers to ensure payment is made in a timely manner 
customer material reserves  distributor contract sales debit reserves and prompt payment discount reserves are based upon historical rates of return or claim and any known  specifically identified unusual returns 
other sales reserves are recorded based upon individual contracts with distributors that may call for reimbursement of product scrapped or reimbursement of price changes that affect the distributors inventory carrying value 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated sales reserves and actual results 
in determining the net realizable value of our inventories  we review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old and therefore subject to obsolescence and inventory in excess of customer backlog 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period our market capitalization relative to net book value significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
when we determine that the carrying value of any long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure impairment based on the difference between an asset s carrying value and an estimate of fair value  which may be determined based upon quotes or a projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with our cost of capital and the risk inherent in our current business model 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as we believe  we expect  we intend  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  plans  estimates  anticipates  or hopeful  or the negative of those terms or other comparable terms  or by discussions of our strategy  plans or future performance 
for example  the outlook section below contains numerous forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements in this report are made based on management s current expectations and estimates  which involve risks and uncertainties  including those described below and more specifically in the business risks section in item  above 
among these factors are the following changes in regional or global economic or political conditions including as a result of terrorist attacks and responses to them  changes in demand for our products  changes in inventories at our customers and distributors  technological and product development risks  availability of manufacturing capacity  availability of raw materials  competitors actions  loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  changes in manufacturing yields or output  and significant litigation 
factors that may affect our operating results are described in the business risks section in the quarterly and annual reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to be materially different from those in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements in this report 
it is our current policy to update our business outlook at least twice each quarter 
the first update is near the beginning of each quarter  within the press release that announces the previous quarter s results 
the second update is within a press release issued approximately two months into each quarter 
the business outlook below is consistent with the outlook included in our february  press release announcing our first quarter update 
the current business outlook is accessible at the investor relations section of our website at investor 
fairchildsemi 
com 
toward the end of each quarter  we observe a quiet period  when the outlook is not updated to reflect management s current expectations 
the quiet period for the first quarter of will be from march  to april   when we plan to release our first quarter results 
except during quiet periods  the business outlook posted on our website reflects current guidance unless and until updated through a press release  sec filing or other public announcement 
during quiet periods  our business outlook  as posted on our website  announced in press releases and provided in quarterly  annual and special reports or other filings with the sec  should be considered to be historical  speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the company 
during quiet periods  fairchild semiconductor representatives will not comment about the business outlook or the company s financial results or expectations 
outlook we believe that we reached the bottom of this market slowdown sometime during the third quarter of and we expect improving market conditions throughout we entered with our backlog levels roughly equal to our beginning backlog entering the fourth quarter and have experienced seasonally strong bookings so far in the first quarter of we expect our first quarter revenues to be roughly flat from fourth quarter levels 
as with the fourth quarter  we expect our foundry revenue to drop more than our trade revenues 
because our backlog pricing for first quarter is slightly lower than fourth quarter due the results of annual contract negotiations and aggressive pricing for mature products  we expect gross margins to be sequentially down as much as to basis points in the first quarter 
we expect to hold inventories flat for the first quarter 
for the remainder of  we expect moderate revenue growth to resume at historical seasonal rates and expect to increase our gross margins gradually as we improve factory utilization and continue selling our new products into the market 
while our overall pricing seems to be bottoming  we believe that currently available industry capacity levels will delay significant price increases for several more quarters 
we are continuing to cut costs where we can  but we believe we have taken most of the major cost reduction steps at this point 
cost reduction in will be mainly due to yield improvements  margin and mix management  exerting purchasing power with our vendors and overall improvements in productivity 
we expect total r d and sg a expenses  excluding amortization of intangibles  to be flat with fourth quarter levels 
interest expense will be in the range of to million per quarter 
we expect our depreciation and amortization to be roughly million for the first quarter and to grow slowly throughout we have adopted sfas and beginning in will no longer amortize our goodwill 
we expect our amortization of intangibles going forward to drop to approximately million per quarter 
our capital expenditure plans remain at approximately to of sales for our focus will be on cost reduction and the expansion of our in house assembly and test capacity for new power products 
recently issued financial accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting statement sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that an assembled workforce may no longer be accounted for as an identifiable intangible asset 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we were required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 effective in the third quarter  and are required to adopt sfas no 
effective december  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 sfas no 
will require us to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
accordingly  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all identifiable intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the first quarter of in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is then determined to have an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
during the first quarter of any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss for goodwill will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill of million  unamortized assembled workforce of million and other unamortized identifiable intangible assets of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill and assembled workforce was million and million for the year ended december   respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and sfas no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we expect to complete this analysis by april  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  issued in august  addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated retirement costs 
sfas no 
 which applies to all entities that have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  issued in october  addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 which applies to all entities  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we use currency forward and combination option contracts to hedge firm commitments and currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
beginning in  similar instruments were also used to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange denominated revenues 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do conduct these activities by way of transactions denominated in other currencies  primarily the korean won  malaysian ringgit  philippine peso  japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
exposures in the korean won are minimal as won denominated revenues and costs generally offset one another 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in other foreign exchange rates  we have established hedging programs 
we utilize currency forward contracts and currency option contracts in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  during the twelve months ended december   an adverse change in any one exchange rate defined as over the course of the year would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than million 
we have no interest rate exposure due to rate changes for the senior subordinated notes  the senior subordinated notes  the senior subordinated notes or the convertible senior subordinated notes 
however  we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the revolving credit facility due to its variable libor pricing 
while there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at december   we had outstanding balances during calendar for example  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of million  assuming all borrowing capability was utilized 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  primarily to reduce interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had no such instruments in place
