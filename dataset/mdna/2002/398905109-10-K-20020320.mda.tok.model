item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retailing industry 
simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering in  we acquired four automobile dealership groups  representing automobile dealership franchises 
through a series of acquisitions  we now operate dealership franchises in texas  oklahoma  florida  georgia  new mexico  colorado  louisiana and massachusetts 
through our dealerships and internet sites  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  arrange related financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  provide maintenance and repair services  and sell replacement parts 
we also operate collision service centers 
we have diverse sources of revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair services  finance fees  vehicle service contract fees  insurance fees  documentary fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
other dealership revenue includes revenues from arranging financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts and documentary fees  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks 
our total gross margin varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales  parts and service sales  collision repair service sales and other dealership revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services varies significantly  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and other dealership revenues generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive based compensation for sales  administrative  finance and general management personnel  rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
we believe that approximately of our selling  general and administrative expenses are variable  allowing us to adjust our cost structure based on business trends 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  including floorplan inventory financing  net of interest income earned 
we receive interest assistance from various of our manufacturers 
this assistance  which is reflected as a reduction of cost of sales  generally equals between and of floorplan interest expense  which mitigates the impact of interest rate changes on our financial results

floorplan and other interest expense  net  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to increases in total debt outstanding and interest rates 
the increase in debt outstanding was primarily attributable to the floorplan borrowings of the additional dealership operations acquired and additional borrowings to complete acquisitions 
further  contributing to the increase was a basis point increase in the weighted average libor 
partially mitigating the libor increase was a basis point rate reduction of the spread charged on our floorplan notes payable  which was effective in may additionally  in december  we received another basis point reduction of the spread charged 
other income  net 
other income  net  increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to a million gain from the sale of a chrysler franchise in austin  texas 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  our credit facility which includes the floorplan facility and the acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth selected historical information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash and cash equivalents at december   were million  and include million of contracts in transit  which are generated in the ordinary course of business 
operating activities 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
excluding working capital changes  during cash flows from operating activities increased million over the prior year period 
investing activities 
the million of cash used for investing activities during was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment and cash paid in acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds from sales of franchises 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities 
during  million of cash was used for investing activities  primarily attributable to cash paid in completing acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from the sales of franchises 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities 
during  million was used for investing activities  primarily attributable to completing acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by sales of property and equipment 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities 
partially offsetting these uses of cash  we received million from sales of property and equipment 
the proceeds were received primarily from the sale of dealership properties to a reit for approximately million  and for which no gain or loss was recognized 
financing activities 
we used approximately million in financing activities during the uses were primarily attributable to paydowns made on our revolving credit facility and purchases of treasury stock  largely offset by the proceeds of our common stock offering 
in october  we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock  with net proceeds from the offering  after expenses  of approximately million 
the proceeds from the offering  as well as cash flows from operations  were used to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility by million 
we may re borrow the amounts repaid under our credit facility for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
during we used approximately  in financing activities 
cash was provided primarily through borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we used million for principal payments of long term debt 
additionally  we used million for purchases of treasury stock 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from our march offerings of million shares of common stock and million of senior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds from these offerings  approximately million  were used to repay million borrowed under the acquisition portion of the credit facility  with the remainder of the proceeds being used in completing acquisitions during additionally  in connection with the sale of properties to a reit  we paid off mortgages of approximately million 
working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million  which is approximately million higher than we believe we need to operate our business 
we expect to use this excess working capital to fund acquisitions and anticipated capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
certain manufacturers have minimum working capital guidelines  which may limit a subsidiary s ability to make distributions to the parent company 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  we believe we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowing capacity under our credit facility to fund our current operations  anticipated capital expenditures and acquisitions 
stock repurchase the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase a portion of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
our agreements  subject to other covenants  allow us to spend approximately percent of our cumulative net income to repurchase stock 
during we repurchased million shares for approximately million  excluding shares repurchased to fulfill obligations under our employee stock purchase plan 
at times we have purchased our stock from related parties 
these transactions were completed at then current market prices 
we allocate resources based on a risk adjusted analysis of expected returns 
as such  we may repurchase shares of our common stock if market conditions allow us to receive an acceptable return on investment 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures exclusive of new or expanded operations have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities  generally  are driven by new franchises being awarded to us by a manufacturer or significant growth in sales at an existing facility 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand nine existing facilities and prepare six new facilities for operations 
additionally  during  we will be relocating certain dealerships we own to new facilities that are being constructed and financed by related and third parties 
we estimate that the relocation of our stores to the new facilities will result in incremental rent expense of approximately million  per year 
acquisition financing we anticipate acquiring at least million in revenues during  consisting of both platform and tuck in acquisitions 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships and borrowings under our credit facility 
credit facility our credit facility provides a floorplan facility of million  with an interest rate of libor plus basis points  for financing vehicle inventories 
additionally  the credit facility provides an acquisition facility of million for financing acquisitions  general corporate purposes and capital expenditures and bears interest at libor plus a margin varying between to basis points  dependent upon certain financial ratios 
the amount available to be borrowed under the acquisition portion of the credit facility is dependent upon a calculation based on our cash flow and maintaining certain financial ratios 
the credit facility also contains various covenants including financial ratios  such as fixed charge coverage  interest coverage and a minimum net worth requirement  among others  as well as other requirements which must be maintained 
the lending group making up the credit facility is comprised of major financial institutions  including five manufacturer captive finance companies 
the manufacturer captive finance companies are ford motor credit company  toyota motor credit corporation  bmw financial services na inc  chrysler financial company  llc and mercedes benz credit corporation 
as of march   million is available to be drawn under the acquisition facility  subject to a cash flow calculation and the maintenance of certain financial ratios and various covenants 
the credit facility allows of net income to be paid as cash dividends 
during july  we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
additionally  during october  we entered into a three year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
the effect of these swaps is to convert the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings from the day libor to an average fixed rate of interest of 
leases we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements  including leases with related parties 
generally  the related party and third party leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three five year option periods  at our option 
see note to the financial statements  which summarizes our obligations to related and third parties 
additionally  we generally have an option to purchase the real estate and facilities at the end of the lease term  and a right of first refusal  giving us the opportunity to purchase the real estate and facilities  if the owner reaches an agreement to sell them to a third party 
obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations contractual cash obligations thereafter total in thousands debt     floorplan notes payable 
  leases        other long term obligations   total        excludes interest payments 
our credit facility is currently set to mature on december  the credit facility provides commitments for inventory financing  floorplan notes payable  up to million  of which we had borrowed million at december  payments  generally  are required to be made on the floorplan notes payable as the vehicles are sold 
the credit facility also provides commitments for a revolving credit line for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  up to million  of which none was outstanding at december  other than the interest rate swap agreements discussed above  there are no other significant contractual commitments to or from us 
current business trends during  approximately million new vehicles were sold in the united states 
industry analyst estimates for are predicting new vehicle unit sales of between million and million units 
annual sales of million units would rank as the sixth highest total of new vehicle retail sales in the united states during the past years 
as the used vehicle market is less cyclical than the new vehicle market  we expect to see continued single digit growth in used vehicle retail sales volume 
due to the increase in units in operation from the recent record new vehicle sales  and the increasing complexity of the vehicles being sold today  we expect to see growth in the parts and service market for franchised automobile dealers 
with respect to interest rates  the one month libor  which averaged approximately during  has fallen to approximately in march discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for inventory valuations and future chargebacks on finance and vehicle service contract fees  and valuation of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
inventories new  used and demonstrator vehicles are stated at the lower of cost or market  determined on a specific unit basis 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
the assistance is accounted for as a purchase discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on the balance sheet and as a reduction to cost of sales in the income statement as the vehicles are sold 
parts and accessories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
as the market value of our inventories typically declines with the passage of time  valuation reserves are provided against the inventory balances based on the agings of the inventories and market trends 
finance and service contract income recognition we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers over predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts to customers 
we may be charged back chargebacks for unearned financing fees or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
the revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees in administrator obligor states are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
in dealer obligor states  revenues from vehicle service contract fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the contracts 
finance and vehicle service contract revenues  net of estimated chargebacks  are included in other dealership revenues in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets the following are recently issued statements by the financial accounting standards board that we believe could have a significant impact on our reported financial condition or statement of operations 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations was issued 
sfas no 
eliminates the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method as the only acceptable method 
we adopted this statement effective july  acquired intangible assets  if any  are separately recognized if  among other things  the benefit is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  such as franchise agreements 
goodwill is recorded only to the extent the purchase price for an entity exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
sfas no 
changes the treatment of goodwill by no longer amortizing goodwill  however  other identifiable intangible assets are to be separately recognized and amortized  as applicable 
the statement requires  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets by applying a fair value based test 
a portion of our intangible assets relate to franchise value  which is considered to have an indefinite life 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the statement will result in the elimination of approximately million of goodwill amortization  annually  subsequent to december  additionally  adoption could result in an impairment of goodwill  based on the new fair value based test  which would be reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january  we are currently analyzing the impact this statement will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all items described are non trading

both swaps variable rates are based on day libor 
the rate shown is as of december  we receive interest assistance from various manufacturers 
generally  this assistance equals approximately to of our floorplan notes payable interest expense 
during  we recognized million of assistance  which we accounted for as a purchase discount and reflected as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement as vehicles were sold 
based on our capital structure as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an estimated million change in interest expense  net of tax 
however  as a portion of the interest assistance we receive from the manufacturers tracks changes in interest rates  we estimate that there is effectively no direct impact on our net income of any change in interest rates
