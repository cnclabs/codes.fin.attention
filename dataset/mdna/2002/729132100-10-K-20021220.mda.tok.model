item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide product realization services to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in the networking datacommunications telecom  medical  industrial commercial  computer and transportation industries 
we provide advanced electronics design  manufacturing and testing services to our customers with a focus on complex  high end products 
we offer our customers the ability to outsource all stages of product realization  including development and design  materials procurement and management  prototyping and new product introduction  testing  manufacturing configuration  logistics and test repair 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and the risk factors section beginning on page we provide contract manufacturing services on either a turnkey basis  where we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly  or on a consignment basis  where the customer supplies some  or occasionally all  materials necessary for product assembly 
turnkey services include materials procurement and warehousing in addition to manufacturing and involve greater resource investment and inventory risk management than consignment services 
turnkey manufacturing currently represents over percent of our net sales 
turnkey sales typically generate higher sales and higher gross profit dollars with lower gross margin percentages than consignment sales due to the inclusion of component costs  and related markup  in our net sales 
however  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
due to the nature of turnkey manufacturing  our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in materials costs and the degree of automation used in the assembly process 
mergers and acquisitions in january  we acquired certain assets of mcms  inc mcms  an electronics manufacturing services provider  for approximately million in cash 
the assets purchased from mcms include manufacturing operations in penang  malaysia  xiamen  china  and nampa  idaho 
we acquired these assets primarily to provide electronic manufacturing services in asia and to increase our customer base 
the acquisition did not include the assumption of any interest bearing debt  but included the assumption of total liabilities of approximately million 
we recorded the acquisition utilizing the accounting principles promulgated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
s and the results from mcms operations are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
no goodwill resulted from this acquisition 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs during the second quarter of fiscal associated with the acquisition of the mcms operations 
on may   we acquired qtron  inc qtron  a privately held ems provider located in san diego  california 
we purchased all of the outstanding shares of qtron for approximately million in cash  paid outstanding qtron notes payable of million to qtron shareholders and thereby assumed liabilities of million  including capital lease obligations of million for a new manufacturing facility 
the results of qtron s operations have been reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately million has been recorded as goodwill 
through september   we were amortizing the goodwill over years 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  in accordance with sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
see new accounting pronouncements on page regarding the periodic requirement to review goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
in december  the primary customer of our san diego facility provided notice of its intent to move two new programs to other non plexus facilities during our second fiscal quarter of as a consequence  we intend to close the san diego facility by the end of june we anticipate recording pre tax non recurring charges of approximately million to million in the first quarter of fiscal associated with the closing of the san diego facility 
these non recurring charges will include both an additional impairment of goodwill and the initial sfas no 
impairment evaluation as of october  as of september   we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million associated with the san diego facility 
as a result of these actions and the newly required periodic review of goodwill under sfas no 
 this amount will be fully written off in the first quarter of fiscal on december   we merged with ee corporation ee  a privately held pcb design and engineering service provider for electronic oems  through the issuance of  shares of its common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
costs associated with this merger in the amount of million have been expensed as required 
prior results were not restated  as they would not differ materially from reported results 
during fiscal  we also acquired operations in massachusetts  mexico and the united kingdom see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the year ended september  decreased percent to million from billion for the year ended september  net sales for fiscal included approximately million  or percent of sales  related to the acquired mcms operations 
our reduced sales levels reflect the continued slowdown in technology markets  primarily in the network datacommunications telecom  industrial commercial and computer industries  which have been further impacted by reduced end market demand and reduced availability to companies in these industries of capital resources to fund existing and emerging technologies 
we were also affected by a relatively sharp downturn of orders and forecasts  particularly in engineering  subsequent to the september  attacks  as a consequence of the economic uncertainties resulting from the attacks and their aftermath 
these factors resulted in customers becoming more cautious in placing new orders 
based on our current customers orders and forecasts  we currently expect first quarter fiscal sales to be in the bottom part of the range of million to million and second quarter fiscal sales to be in the range of million to million 
our second quarter fiscal will be impacted by the loss of our primary customer in our san diego operations 
however  our results will ultimately depend on the actual shipment levels 
see risk factors below for other factors which could affect sales 
net sales for the year ended september   increased percent to billion from million for the year ended september  our sales growth was due to sales increases in all end markets but primarily due to the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial end markets 
our acquisitions during fiscal accounted for slightly less than percent of sales for the year ended september  we had no customers which represented more than percent of sales for the years ended september  and lucent technologies accounted for percent of sales for the year ended september  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for percent of sales for the year ended september   compared to percent and percent for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as with sales to most of our customers  sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencement  termination  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued sales to our significant customers  and we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customer forecasts can and do change as a result of their end market demand and other factors 
although any material change in orders from these or other customers could materially affect our results of operations  we are dedicated to diversifying our customer base and decreasing our dependence on any particular customer or customers 
our sales for the years ended september   and  respectively  by industry were as follows industry networking datacommunications telecom medical industrial commercial computer transportation other gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september   decreased percent to million from million for the year ended september  the gross margin for the year ended september   was percent  compared to percent for the year ended september  gross margins have decreased from fiscal results due primarily to our reduced manufacturing and engineering capacity utilization 
overall gross margins continue to be affected by our lower sales levels as a result of a slowdown in end market demand  particularly in the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial industries  and its impact on our capacity utilization 
our gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of start up costs and efficiencies of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price erosion within the electronics industry  capacity utilization of surface mount and other equipment  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  average sales prices  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
these and other factors can cause variations in our operating results 
although our focus is on maintaining and expanding gross margins  there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
gross profit for the year ended september   increased percent to million from million for the year ended september  the gross margin for the year ended september   was percent  compared to percent for the year ended september  the decline in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the negative affect of acquisitions and reduced manufacturing capacity utilization 
in particular  gross margins resulting from the acquisition of the mexico turnkey operations of elamex  keltek and qtron operations were below our historical gross margins as we worked to integrate these acquisitions into our product realization model and increase their capacity utilization 
most of the research and development we conduct is paid for by our customers and is therefore included in both sales and cost of sales 
we conduct our own research and development  but that research and development is not specifically identified and we believe such expenses are less than one percent of our sales 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the year ended september   increased to million from million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  s a expenses were percent for the year ended september   compared to percent and percent for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in dollar terms and percentage of net sales was due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts and additional investment for information technology systems support related to the roll out of our new enterprise resource planning erp platform 
in late fiscal  we converted two manufacturing facilities to the new platform  which resulted in additional training and implementation costs 
training and implementation cost are expected to continue over the next two years as we convert our remaining facilities to the new erp platform 
staffing levels also increased during fiscal as a result of the acquisition of the mcms operations 
amortization of goodwill increased to million for the year ended september  from million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this was a result of the acquisitions of the mexico turnkey operations  keltek and qtron operations which resulted in additional goodwill 
commencing in the first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt sfas no 
 the impact of which will result in eliminating approximately million of annual amortization of goodwill 
see new accounting pronouncements on page regarding the periodic requirement to review goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
for the year ended september   we recorded a series of restructuring charges totaling million 
these charges were taken in response to the reduction in our sales levels and reduced capacity utilization 
we evaluated our cost structure compared to anticipated sales levels and determined that reductions of our workforce  consolidation of certain leased facilities  write downs of certain underutilized assets to fair value and planned facility closures were necessary to reduce costs to more appropriate levels in line with current and expected customer demand 
one facility  located near minneapolis  minnesota  was closed in late fiscal another facility  which is one of four located in neenah  wisconsin  will be phased out of operations by mid fiscal both facilities represent older  owned facilities that are no longer sufficient to service our customers needs and would have required significant investment to upgrade or replace them 
the minneapolis facility was sold in october in december  we announced our intent to take further global restructuring actions including the closure of our san diego  california manufacturing facility and the consolidation of our seattle  washington facilities 
the decision to close the san diego facility was made in response to a decision of the facility s major customer to transition two new programs to non plexus facilities 
approximately employees will be affected by these actions  along with more than employees from previously announced restructurings 
currently  we estimate total pre tax non recurring charges of approximately million to million to be recorded in our first fiscal quarter ending december  for the year ended september   we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs related to the mcms acquisition 
acquisition and merger costs of approximately million for the year ended september  were related to the qtron and ee acquisitions 
for the year ended september   we also had merger and acquisition costs of million related to agility  keltek and the mexico turnkey operations acquisitions 
for the year ended september   we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million 
we reduced our cost structure through the reduction of our work force and writing off certain under utilized assets in response to the reduction in our sales levels and reduced capacity utilization 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to a million tax benefit for the year ended september   from million and million of income tax expense for the years ended september  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate has decreased to  due to the effect of non tax deductible goodwill and merger expenses and our loss before income taxes being close to break even 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended september   compared to cash flows provided by used in operating activities of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
for the year ended september   actual days sales outstanding represented by our accounts receivable improved to days from days for the year ended september  included in this calculation is the addback of amounts utilized under the securitization facility to accounts receivable in the determination of days sales outstanding this amount was million and million as of september  and  respectively 
an improvement in our annualized inventory turns to turns for the year ended september  from turns for the year ended september  resulted in a decrease in our inventory levels 
this increase in inventory turns was primarily the result of an improved marketplace for components and improved inventory management 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended september  the primary uses included payments of million for the acquisition of mcms assets  million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and net payments of million for short term investments 
we utilize available cash  debt and leases to fund our operating requirements 
we utilize operating leases primarily in situations where technical obsolescence concerns are determined to outweigh the benefits of financing the equipment purchase 
we currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million to million 
this estimate does not include any acquisitions which we may undertake 
the level of capital expenditures for fiscal will be heavily dependent on anticipated sales levels 
cash flows used in financing activities totaling million for the year ended september  primarily represent net payments on our credit facilities 
the ratio of total liabilities to equity was to and to as of september  and  respectively 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with a group of banks 
effective november   we reduced our maximum borrowing capacity to million from million 
as of september   no amounts were outstanding  our available borrowing capacity was approximately million 
borrowing capacity utilized under the credit facility will be either through revolving or other loans or through guarantees of commercial paper 
interest on borrowings is computed at the applicable eurocurrency rate on the agreed currency  plus any commitment fees 
the credit facility matures on october   and requires among other things maintenance of minimum interest expense coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
during fiscal  plexus  along with our banking partners  amended our credit facility to allow us to revise certain covenants and be in compliance with these covenants 
the amendment was occasioned by the effect of our restructuring costs and acquisition and merger costs on compliance with the prior covenants 
in december  we announced our intent to take further global restructuring actions including the closure of our san diego manufacturing facility and the consolidation of our seattle facilities 
currently  the company estimates total pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million to be recorded in its first fiscal quarter ending december  as a result of these restructuring charges  we anticipate that we will not meet certain financial covenants of our credit facility for the quarter ending december  we therefore plan to terminate our credit facility prior to december  it is our intention to seek to replace the existing credit facility with a comparable facility 
however  we cannot assure whether  or under what terms  a new credit facility will be available 
pursuant to a public offering of shares of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal  we issued million shares of common stock for per share  with an underwriters discount of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  after discounts and commissions to the underwriters of approximately million 
additional expenses were approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering were utilized to refinance  in part  existing debt and to finance capital expenditures  capacity expansion and the qtron acquisition 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital 
we have agreed to sell up to million of trade accounts receivable without recourse to plexus abs inc abs  a wholly owned  limited purpose subsidiary 
abs is a separate corporate entity that sells participating interests in a pool of our accounts receivable to financial institutions 
the financial institutions then receive an ownership and security interest in the pool of receivables 
as of september   the total available funding amount under the asset securitization facility was approximately million  of which million was utilized 
as a result  accounts receivable has been reduced by million as of september   while long term debt and capital lease obligations does not include this million of off balance sheet financing 
in april and december  we  along with our banking partners  amended our receivables purchase agreement to allow us to revise certain covenants and be in compliance with these covenants 
our leasing capabilities  cash and short term investments and projected cash from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements through fiscal and the foreseeable future 
we anticipate negotiation during fiscal to replace our credit facility  although we cannot assure whether  or under what terms  a new or extended credit facility will be available 
while the availability of a credit facility facilitates corporate operations  we do not believe that lack of such a facility would materially affect our operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate using earnings to support our business 
disclosure about critical accounting policies on december   the sec issued fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
fr is an intermediate step to alert companies to the need for greater investor awareness of the sensitivity of financial statements to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying their preparation  including the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the more critical of these policies are as follows revenue recognition we continued to recognize revenues primarily when products are shipped 
revenue and profit relating to product design and development contracts are generally recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method 
the use of percentage of completion accounting does involve the use of estimates  but accounts for less than percent of our total revenues 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
inventories we value inventories primarily at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
as discussed later under risk factors  our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons which are beyond our control 
any of these  or certain additional actions  could impact the valuation of our inventory 
we continued to use the same techniques to value our inventory as we have in the past 
any actions taken by our customers that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations 
accounts receivable we value accounts receivable net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this allowance is based on our estimate of the portion of the receivables that will not be collected in the future 
however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
during fiscal  we converted million of accounts receivable from a related party customer into a minority equity interest 
in addition  we accepted stock warrants in exchange for million of accounts receivable from another customer during fiscal the conversion of accounts receivable to a minority equity interest and the acceptance of stock warrants represented full and final settlement of all accounts receivable with such customers 
as of september   the minority equity interest and the stock warrants are recorded net of a million and million reserve  respectively  in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows which the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill by determining whether the unamortized goodwill balance can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operation 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds 
as of september   no adjustments to the carrying value of our long lived assets were required 
in december  we announced restructuring actions planned for the first fiscal quarter ending december  which will result in significant adjustments to the carrying value of certain of our long term assets 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs from time to time  we have recorded restructuring costs in response to the reduction in our sales levels and reduced capacity utilization 
these restructuring charges included employee severance and benefit costs  costs related to plant closings  including leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  as applicable  and impairment of equipment 
severance and benefit costs are recorded when incurred 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the estimated lease loss is accrued for future lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less estimated sublease income 
for equipment  the impairment losses recognized are based on the fair value estimated using existing market prices for similar assets less costs to sell 
in december  we announced our intent to take further global restructuring actions including the closure of our san diego  california manufacturing facility and the consolidation of our seattle  washington facilities 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional disclosures concerning liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements on january   the sec issued fr  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this statement is to suggest steps that issuers should consider in meeting their current disclosure obligations with respect to the topics described 
liquidity disclosures we include a discussion of liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis 
more specifically  fr requires management to consider the following to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements or other arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  changes in terms  acceleration of maturity  or the creation of an additional financial obligation  such as adverse changes in the registrant s credit rating  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows  or stock price  or changes in the value of underlying  linked or indexed assets 
our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios to comply with the terms of the agreement 
no amounts are outstanding under the credit facility at september  and we do not currently anticipate the need to borrow on the credit facility in the near term 
we  along with our banking partners  have amended our credit facility to allow us to revise certain covenants and be in compliance with these covenants 
the amendment was occasioned by the effect of our restructuring costs and acquisition and merger costs on compliance with the prior covenants 
in december  we announced our intent to take further global restructuring actions including the closure of our san diego manufacturing facility and the consolidation of our seattle facilities 
currently  the company estimates total pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million to be recorded in its first fiscal quarter ending december  as a result of these restructuring charges  we anticipate that we will not meet certain financial covenants of our credit facility for the quarter ending december  we therefore plan to terminate our credit facility prior to december  it is our intention to seek to replace the existing credit facility with a comparable facility 
however  we cannot assure whether  or under what terms  a new credit facility will be available 
while the availability of a credit facility facilitates corporate operations  we do not believe that lack of such a facility would materially affect our operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified investment grade credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we are not aware of any specific factor or factors that could reasonably be expected to impair our ability to continue to engage in our historical operations at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect the registrant s ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we are not aware of anything that could reasonably be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
d 
guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties 
we do not have any significant guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties 
e 
written options on non financial assets for example  real estate puts 
we do not have any written options on non financial assets 
off balance sheet arrangements fr indicates that registrants should consider the need to provide disclosures concerning transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect materially liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 
we disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form k  an asset securitization facility that plexus entered into in fiscal plexus s wholly owned  limited purpose subsidiary  plexus abs inc  has agreed to purchase up to million of receivables from plexus and sell participating interests to financial institutions 
as of september   the total available funding amount under the asset securitization facility was approximately million  of which million was utilized 
any interests sold to the financial institutions are removed from the balance sheet as we have no risk of loss on such receivables since they are sold without recourse 
in april and december  we  along with our banking partners  amended our receivables purchase agreement to allow us to revise certain covenants and be in compliance with these covenants 
we also lease various assets under both capital and operating leases 
the aggregate payments under the capital leases and operating leases are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements in this report on form k 
there were no significant changes to these lease arrangements during fiscal  with the exception of certain operating leases assumed by us associated with our january acquisition of certain assets of mcms 
these leases primarily relate to production facilities and equipment in malaysia and china 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments in fr  the sec notes that current accounting standards require disclosure concerning a registrant s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as debt guarantees 
they also indicate that the disclosures responsive to these requirements usually are located in various parts of a registrant s filings 
the sec believes that investors would find it beneficial if aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments were provided in a single location so that a total picture of obligations would be readily available 
they further suggested that one useful aid to presenting the total picture of a registrant s liquidity and capital resources and the integral role of on and off balance sheet arrangements may be schedules of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the latest balance sheet date 
we are no different from most other registrants in that our disclosures are located in various parts of our regulatory filings  including notes     and to our consolidated financial statements in this report on form k 
in addition  we prepared schedules as of september  suggested by the sec in fr information in the following table is in thousands as of september  payments due by period and contractual obligations total thereafter gross capital lease obligations      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations      there are no unconditional purchase obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   other than our off balance sheet asset securitization facility million as of september   we did not have  and were not subject to  any other lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  or other commercial commitments 
disclosures about certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value we do not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related and certain other parties we have disclosed the effects of transactions with a related party in note to our consolidated financial statements in this report on form k 
there were no other significant transactions with related and certain other parties 
new accounting pronouncements in july  sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
the statements eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and require that goodwill and certain intangible assets not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed for impairment annually with any related losses recognized in earnings when incurred 
sfas no 
was effective for us for business combinations completed subsequent to june  sfas no 
will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal for existing goodwill and intangible assets 
the impact of sfas no 
will result in eliminating approximately million of annual amortization of goodwill 
however  we will be required to perform annual impairment tests to determine goodwill impairment  if any  which could materially affect the results in any given period 
sfas no 
requires that we perform a transitional goodwill impairment evaluation 
step one of the evaluation requires that we perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective october  and to complete our step one evaluation by march  subsequent to september   we completed step one of the evaluation and concluded that we have material goodwill impairment  since the estimated fair value based on expected future discounted cash flows to be generated from each location was significantly less than the carrying values 
we are in the process of completing the second step of the transitional impairment test for these locations 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of each location s goodwill  determined by allocating its fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured at the date of adoption 
the second step of the evaluation is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than september  in connection with allocating the fair value of the locations to the various assets and liabilities  we are in the process of obtaining independent valuations of unrecognized intangible assets and fixed assets 
upon completion of step two  any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
in december  the primary customer of our san diego facility provided notice of its intent to move two new programs to other non plexus facilities during our second fiscal quarter of as a consequence  we intend to close the san diego facility by the end of june we anticipate recording pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million associated with the closing of the san diego facility in the first quarter of fiscal these restructuring charges will include both an additional impairment of goodwill and the initial sfas no 
impairment evaluation as of october  as of september   we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million associated with the san diego facility 
as a result of these actions and the newly required periodic review of goodwill under sfas no 
 this amount will be fully written off in the first quarter of fiscal in august  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued 
sfas no 
sets forth the financial accounting and reporting to be followed for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
subsequently  the recorded liability will be accreted to its present value and the capitalized costs will be depreciated 
sfas no 
will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
sfas no 
modifies and expands the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets other than goodwill  which is specifically addressed by sfas no 
sfas no 
maintains the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized for a long lived asset to be held and used if its carrying value is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  with the recognized impairment being the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
with respect to long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale  sfas no 
requires that the asset be considered held and used until it is actually disposed of  but requires that its depreciable life be revised in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
sfas no 
also requires that an impairment loss be recognized at the date a long lived asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset 
sfas no 
will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
in may  sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections was issued 
the statement rescinds sfas no 
and requires that only unusual or infrequent gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items  consistent with apb this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends certain existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or result of operations 
the remaining provisions of this statement became effective for us starting may  and did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
restructuring charges recorded in fiscal and  as discussed in note  were recorded in accordance with issue risk factors our customer requirements and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the volume of customer orders relative to our capacity the level and timing of customer orders  particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers release a significant percentage of their orders during the last few weeks of a quarter the typical short life cycle of our customers products market acceptance of and demand for our customers products changes in our sales mix to our customers the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes changes in cost and availability of labor and components changes in economic conditions local events that may affect our production volume  such as local holidays 
the ems industry is impacted by the state of the us and global economies and world events 
a continued slowdown in the us or global economies  or in particular in the industries served by us  may result in our customers further reducing their forecasts 
our sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  impacted by the slowdown in the networking datacommunications  industrial and computer markets  which more recently have been further impacted by reduced end market demand and reduced availability of capital resources to fund existing and emerging technologies 
these factors contributed substantially to the decline in our fiscal net sales 
as a result  the demand for our services could continue to be weak or decrease  which in turn would impact our sales  capacity utilization  margins and results 
due to the nature of turnkey manufacturing services  our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs and availability  and the degree of capacity utilization in the manufacturing process 
the majority of our sales comes from a small number of customers and if we lose any of these customers  our sales and operating results could decline significantly 
sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority or near majority of our sales in recent periods 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the identities of our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of major customers  could seriously harm our business 
for example  the primary customer of our san diego  california facility provided us notice in december of its intent to move two new programs to other non plexus facilities during our second fiscal quarter of  as a consequence  we are closing that facility and taking significant restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal if we are not able to replace expired  canceled or reduced contracts with new business on a timely basis  our sales will decrease 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons which are beyond our control 
the success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could seriously harm our operating results 
such cancellations  reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur in response to the slowdown in the networking datacommunications telecom  industrial commercial and computer industries as a result of the overall weakness of the economy 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  facility requirements  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to estimate accurately the future requirements of those customers 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
although we have had a net increase in our manufacturing capacity over the past few fiscal years  we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific project 
we may have significant new customer relationships with emerging companies  which may present more risks than with established companies 
we currently anticipate that a significant percentage of our sales will continue to be to emerging companies  including start ups  particularly in the networking datacommunications market 
however  similar to our other customer relationships  there are no volume purchase commitments under these new programs  and the revenues we actually achieve may not meet our expectations 
in anticipation of future activities under these programs  we incur substantial expenses as we add personnel and manufacturing capacity and procure materials 
because emerging companies do not have a history of operations  it will be harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers 
our operating results will be harmed if sales do not develop to the extent and within the time frame we anticipate 
customer relationships with emerging companies also present special risks 
for example  because they do not have an extensive product history  there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products 
also  due to the current economic environment  additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or we previously experienced 
this tightening of financing for start up customers  together with many start up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk  especially in accounts receivable and inventories 
although we adjust our reserves for accounts receivable and inventories for all customers  including start up customers  based on the information available  these reserves may not be adequate 
failure to manage our growth and our contraction may seriously harm our business 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years  both internally and through acquisitions  even though the most recent periods have seen reductions in sales levels 
this growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on our operations 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our financial  operational and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  manage and motivate our employees 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
periods of contraction or reduced sales  such as fiscal  also create tensions and challenges 
we must determine whether all facilities remain productive and determine how to respond to changing levels of customer demand 
while maintenance of facilities increases short term costs  too much capacity reduction could impair our ability to respond to later market improvements or to maintain customer relationships 
our decisions as to how to reduce costs and capacity can affect our results in both the short term and long term 
we have a licensing arrangement for new erp software and related information systems 
conversions to new software and systems are complicated processes  and can cause management and operational disruptions which may affect us 
information flow and production could also be affected if the new software and systems do not perform as we expect 
we may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we have pursued a strategy that has included growth through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete future acquisitions  due primarily to increased competition for the acquisition of electronics manufacturing service operations 
if we are unable to acquire additional businesses  our growth could be inhibited 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions  such as mcms or future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us 
these risks include operating risks  such as the inability to integrate successfully our acquired operations businesses and personnel inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites strain placed on our personnel  systems and resources possible modification or termination of an acquired business customer programs  including cancellation of current or anticipated programs loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
financial risks  such as the use of cash resources  or incurrence of additional debt and related interest costs dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities inability to achieve expected operating margins to offset the increased fixed costs associated with acquisitions  and or inability to increase margins at acquired entities to plexus desired levels incurrence of large write offs or write downs impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses 
expansion of our business and operations may negatively impact our business 
we may expand our operations by establishing or acquiring new facilities or by expanding capacity in our current facilities 
we may expand both in geographical areas in which we currently operate and in new geographical areas within the united states and internationally 
we may not be able to find suitable facilities on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us 
expansion of our business and operations involves numerous business risks  including the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or capacity and to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value additional fixed costs which may not be fully absorbed by the new business difficulties in the timing of expansions  including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans creation of excess capacity  and the need to reduce capacity elsewhere if anticipated sales or opportunities do not materialize diversion of management s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions strain placed on our operational  financial  management  technical and information systems and resources disruption in manufacturing operations incurrence of significant costs and expenses inability to locate enough customers or employees to support the expansion 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks 
as part of the mcms acquisition in january  we acquired operations located in china and malaysia 
in addition  we acquired operations in mexico and the united kingdom in fiscal we may in the future expand into other international regions 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating in mexico and the united kingdom  and had no prior experience in china and malaysia 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of these international aspects of our operations  we are subject to the following risks that could materially impact our operating results economic or political instability transportation delays or interruptions and other effects of less developed infrastructure in many countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations utilization of different systems and equipment difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures the effects of international political developments 
in addition  changes in policies by the us or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties  tariffs  taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers 
for example  our mexico based operation utilizes the maquiladora program  which provides reduced tariffs and eases import regulations  and we could be adversely affected by changes in that program 
also  the newly acquired chinese and malaysian subsidiaries currently receive favorable tax treatment from the governments in those countries for approximately to years  which may or may not be renewed 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel maintain and enhance our technological capabilities develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to obtain raw materials or components for our assemblies on a timely basis or at all 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
during fiscal and early fiscal  component shortages were prevalent in our industry  and in certain areas recur from time to time 
in some cases  supply shortages and delays in deliveries of particular components have resulted in curtailed production  or delays in production  of assemblies using that component  which contributed to an increase in our inventory levels 
we expect that shortages and delays in deliveries of some components will continue from time to time 
an increase in economic activity could also result in shortages  if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate the increased orders 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis  we may experience manufacturing and shipping delays  which could harm our relationships with customers and reduce our sales 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such repricings or  if such repricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
our turnkey manufacturing services involve inventory risk 
most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis  where we purchase some or all of the materials required for designing  product assembling and manufacturing 
these services involve greater resource investment and inventory risk management than consignment services  where the customer provides these materials 
accordingly  various component price increases and inventory obsolescence could adversely affect our selling price  gross margins and operating results 
in our turnkey operations  we need to order parts and supplies based on customer forecasts  which may be for a larger quantity of product than is included in the firm orders ultimately received from those customers 
customers cancellation or reduction of orders can result in expenses to us 
while many of our customer agreements include provisions which require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory specifically ordered to meet their forecasts  we may not actually be reimbursed or be able to collect on these obligations 
in that case  we could have excess inventory and or cancellation or return charges from our supplies 
start up costs and inefficiencies related to new programs can adversely affect our operating results 
start up costs  the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships  and the need to estimate required resources in advance can adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
these factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs 
these factors also affect our ability to efficiently use labor and equipment 
in addition  if any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated  our operating results could be harmed  particularly in the short term 
we are subject to extensive government regulations 
we are also subject to environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  recycling and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of business 
these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense 
while we are not currently aware of any material violations  we may have to spend funds to comply with present and future regulations or be required to perform site remediation 
in addition  our medical device business  which represented approximately percent of our fiscal year sales  is subject to substantial government regulation  primarily from the fda and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
we must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design  development  testing  manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety 
failure to comply with these rules can result in  among other things  our and our customers being subject to fines  injunctions  civil penalties  criminal prosecution  recall or seizure of devices  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant pre market clearance or record approvals for projections or the withdrawal of marketing approvals 
the fda also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment  or refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers 
violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility 
in addition  the failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications which are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing errors or failures 
defects have been discovered in products we manufactured in the past and  despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts  defects may occur in the future 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects occur in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may also be impaired 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us 
even if customers are responsible for the defects  they may or may not be able to assume responsibility for any costs or payments 
our products are for the electronics industry  which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles 
factors affecting the electronics industry  in particular the short life cycle of products  could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  which result in short product life cycles the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidations and other changes in the electronics manufacturing services industry result in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
as a result  competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced sales and margins or loss of market share 
we may fail to secure or maintain necessary financing 
we have made and intend to continue to make substantial capital expenditures to expand our operations  acquire businesses and remain competitive in the rapidly changing electronics manufacturing services industry 
our ability to borrow under our current credit facility is dependent upon compliance with various financial covenants 
as a result of first quarter restructuring charges  we anticipate that we will not meet certain financial covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility for the quarter ending december  we therefore plan to terminate our unsecured revolving credit facility prior to december  it is our intention to seek to replace the revolving credit facility 
however we cannot assure whether  or under what terms  a new credit facility will be available 
our future success may depend on our ability to obtain financing and capital to support our continued growth and operations  including our working capital needs 
we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock or other equity securities issuing debt securities obtaining new credit facilities obtaining off balance sheet financing 
we may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to your ownership interest 
furthermore  any additional financing and capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as restrictive financial or operating covenants  and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel may harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of existing products 
the competition for these individuals is significant  and the loss of key employees  generally none of whom is subject to an employment agreement for a specified term or a post employment non competition agreement  could harm our business 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly and experienced declines in recent periods 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors and the market for our services  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and especially the nasdaq stock market along with market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility and weakness that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility and weakness in plexus stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices which they pay 
the volatility and weakness could also impair plexus ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
a discussion of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is incorporated by reference from our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  in this form k  within note description of business and significant accounting policies 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our fiscal expansion into additional international markets malaysia and china may increase the complexity and size of our foreign exchange risk 
as of september   our foreign currency contracts were scheduled to mature in less than three months and were not material 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we currently do not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our credit facilities and asset securitization facility 
interest on borrowings is computed at the applicable eurocurrency rate on the agreed currency 
a percent change in our weighted average interest rate on average long term borrowings would have impacted net interest expense by approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and respectively
