item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
we provide broadband wireless internet and wireless subscription television services using up to approximately mhz of radio spectrum licensed by the fcc in the ghz and ghz bands  primarily in medium and small markets across texas  oklahoma and the midwestern united states 
we own the bta authorization  or otherwise license or lease mds  mmds and itfs spectrum  in markets covering an estimated million total households  including two markets covering an estimated  total households for which we have entered into a definitive agreement or letter of intent to acquire 
on average  we own or lease mhz of spectrum per market 
our long term business strategy is to provide fixed  portable and  ultimately  mobile broadband internet access and other information services using our high capacity mmds radio spectrum in medium and small markets 
see item  business overview in this report 
historically  we have used our spectrum to provide wireless subscription television services  commonly referred to as wireless cable 
we presently have wireless cable transmission facilities constructed and operating in markets in eight states 
at march   we had approximately  wireless cable customers  including approximately  customers who subscribed only to programming service provided over our mmds spectrum  and  combo subscribers who subscribed to both our mmds programming service and to directv programming service sold by us 
in addition  at march   there were approximately  customers who received only directv programming sold by us 
in march  as part of our long term plan to focus on the use of our spectrum for broadband internet and other advanced wireless services  we announced the signing of agreements with directv  pegasus and time warner cable to convert substantially all of our wireless cable subscribers to programming provided by these entities 
see item  business conversion of wireless cable business in this report 
reorganization 
on april   the effective date  we consummated our plan to  among other things  exchange approximately million of senior and subordinated debt and accrued interest for common stock 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting  financial information in the consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december  and  and the period from the effective date to december  the successor period  is presented on a different basis than the financial information for the period january   to the effective date the predecessor period 
accordingly  such information is not comparable 
the predecessor period includes operations through march   plus the gain on debt forgiveness recognized on the effective date 
the successor period includes operations from the effective date through december  see item  business reorganization 
revenues 
our revenues currently consist primarily of monthly fees paid by wireless cable subscribers for basic programming  premium programming  equipment rental  and other miscellaneous fees  and revenues from our agency relationship with directv which will include revenues from directv and others in from the conversion program discussed in item of this report 
revenues also include fees generated from internet operations in austin and sherman denison  texas 
unless the context requires otherwise  all references to subscribers or systems are to our wireless cable subscribers and systems because revenues and subscribers from our internet business were immaterial in approximately of consolidated revenues 
subscription revenues from wireless cable subscribers and continuing monthly service fees from directv for each directv customer generated are recognized as service is provided 
if the company does not meet minimum subscriber benchmarks each year  the directv continuing monthly service fee will be reduced 
effective january   wireless cable and directv installation revenue  and revenue received from our agency relationship with directv except for continuing monthly service fees  which are recognized as received  is recognized to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  and the remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
a chargeback reserve is recorded for all directv contingencies 
prior to  wireless cable installation revenue was offset against the nonrecoverable portion of installation costs  with the excess cost capitalized and amortized to depreciation expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
prior to  directv installation revenue cash received directly from the customer in conjunction with the sale was offset against direct incremental costs  with the resulting amount recorded as a net asset 
this asset  referred to as subscriber acquisition costs  was amortized as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in proportion to the revenues projected to be generated over the expected subscriber relationship period 
revenue from our agency relationship with directv other than monthly service fees was recognized as the contingencies related to each revenue component were resolved 
a chargeback reserve was not recorded for canceled subscribers 
the company revised the application of its sfas no 
accounting for wireless cable installation and directv revenues prospectively  effective january   as discussed above 
see md a revised application of accounting policy and restatement of quarterly results 
system operations expenses 
system operations expenses include channel lease payments  wireless cable programming costs  labor  and overhead  and costs related to service calls and disconnects  transmitter site and tower rentals  and certain repairs and maintenance expenditures 
programming costs  with the exception of minimum payments  channel lease payments  and repairs and maintenance  are variable expenses based on the number of subscribers 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses include office and administrative costs of operating our wireless cable markets and our two internet markets  as well as sales and marketing and bad debt expenses related to these operations and corporate costs directly and indirectly allocated to these operations 
in addition  the direct incremental costs incurred in generating a customer relationship with directv  comprised of material  equipment and labor  are recorded as an asset 
this asset  referred to as subscriber acquisition costs  is amortized as a component of sg a expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
prior to  the direct incremental cost was offset by directv installation revenue  with only the resulting excess cost recorded as subscriber acquisition costs and amortized as a component of sg a expense in proportion to revenues projected to be generated over the expected subscriber relationship period 
the company revised the application of its sfas no 
accounting for directv installation revenue prospectively  effective january   as discussed above 
see md a revised application of accounting policy and restatements of quarterly results 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of systems and equipment and capitalized installation costs  and amortization of license and leased license investment 
our policy is to capitalize the direct costs of wireless cable installations 
these direct costs include reception materials and equipment on subscriber premises and installation labor 
these direct costs are capitalized as systems and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and are amortized over the useful life of the asset currently five years for the recoverable portion and the estimated average subscription term currently three years for the nonrecoverable portion of such costs 
the nonrecoverable portion of the cost of a wireless cable installation becomes fully depreciated upon disconnection of the subscriber 
prior to  the company capitalized only the excess of nonrecoverable costs of wireless cable installations over installation revenue 
the company revised the application of its sfas no 
accounting for wireless cable nonrecoverable installation costs prospectively  effective january   as discussed above 
see md a revised application of accounting policy and restatement of quarterly results 
ebitda 
ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non recurring items  is widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in the internet  cable television and telecommunication industries 
ebitda is also widely accepted as a financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda is not a financial measure determined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results or to cash flows as a measure of funds available for discretionary or other liquidity purposes 
ebitda may not be comparably calculated from one company to another 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table summarizes the operating results for the year ended december   in comparison to the years ended december  and  combining the results for the predecessor period january   through the effective date with the successor period the effective date through december  
the most significant impact of the plan was a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the write down of certain long lived assets to estimated fair value  a decrease in interest expense due to the extinguishment of certain liabilities subject to compromise  and a one time  non recurring gain on extinguishment of liabilities subject to compromise 
specific trends addressed within the discussion of operating results will refer to the combined results as presented in this table  unless otherwise noted years ended december  dollars in thousands revenues    systems operations expense    system operations expense percent of revenue selling  general and administrative expense    selling  general and administrative expense percent of revenue depreciation and amortization    impairment of long lived assets  interest income   interest expense    other income expense  reorganization costs  net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities  revenues 
our revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease from to and a decrease from to the average number of wireless cable subscribers for the year ended december   was  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during the years ended december   and  we had   and  average subscribers  respectively  who received only directv programming sold by us 
beginning in january  we did not include these customers in our reported wireless cable subscriber base but we do receive certain agency revenue from directv related to these accounts  as well as equipment lease payments from a portion of these customers 
we also do not include these customers or their related revenues in our calculation of recurring average revenue per subscriber 
prior year calculations have been revised to conform with this presentation 
the decline in revenues from to was primarily due to fewer total wireless cable subscribers resulting from decreased sales and marketing as we continued to shift our principal business focus from providing wireless cable service to testing and developing our broadband wireless ip based services  price increases for our wireless cable service in the first and third quarters of and fourth quarter of  which resulted in increased disconnects by video subscribers in and  respectively  and the suspension  in seven markets in march  of our offer of video programming provided solely over mmds frequencies in anticipation of transitioning this spectrum to internet services 
in addition  in the company adjusted the fair value of its liabilities at fresh start by million  and correspondingly reduced revenues that had been deferred and recognized since fresh start 
also  in connection with its revised application of sfas no 
in  the company established a million chargeback reserve for canceled subscribers 
these two changes resulted in a reduction in total revenues in of million 
this decline was partially offset by a revision in policy for recognizing wireless cable and directv installation revenue and revenue received from our agency relationship with directv except for continuing monthly service fees  which are recognized as received 
prior to  wireless cable installation revenue was offset against the nonrecoverable portion of installation costs  with the excess cost capitalized and amortized to depreciation expense over the expected subscriber relationship period 
prior to  directv installation revenue cash received directly from the customer in conjunction with the sale was offset against direct incremental costs  with the resulting amount recorded as a net asset and amortized to sg a in proportion to the revenues projected to be generated over the expected subscriber relationship period 
beginning in  these revenues are now recognized to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  and the remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
this resulted in million of additional revenues in average monthly recurring revenue per subscriber was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase over these periods is due to overall higher priced packages being purchased by our subscribers  including increased purchases of premium programming and price increases for wireless cable services 
we expect to convert our wireless cable subscriber base to satellite programming provided by directv and pegasus  and cable programming provided by time warner cable  by march except for a nominal residual royalty and recognition of deferred revenue related to cash received at the time of conversion  we do not expect our existing wireless cable subscriber base to continue to generate material revenues or cash flows for the company beyond march see item  business conversion of wireless cable business in this report 
we expect to recognize revenues associated with the conversion of subscribers to directv and pegasus to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  and the remainder to be deferred and amortized to income over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
a chargeback reserve will be recorded for all directv contingencies 
we do not expect the decline in revenues to be offset materially by an increase in revenues from our internet business in  as it is unlikely that we will be able to validate the most efficient technical platform for delivery of advanced wireless services early enough in to then deploy and successfully operate this technology in our markets 
system operations expense 
system operations expenses were in  million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  system operations expenses were in  in and in the decrease in system operations expense over the periods presented was primarily due to lower service call expense and programming expense as a result of lower subscriber count and a larger proportion of directv subscribers  which have lower programming costs 
system operations expense as a percent of revenue increased in and due to higher costs under certain spectrum leases that were renegotiated in preparation for providing two way broadband wireless services  and due to the fixed portion of technical labor in certain video markets which has been reduced to minimum levels with the decline in subscribers 
we expect system operations expense to decrease further in as we reduce technical and operational support in our wireless cable markets to minimum levels and eliminate programming and service call costs 
we will continue to incur labor costs through and the first quarter of in connection with the conversion of our wireless cable subscriber base 
see item  business conversion of wireless cable business in this report 
sg a expense 
sg a expense was million in  million in and million in as a percent of revenues  sg a expense was in  in and in sg a expense decreased annually from through due to savings from the consolidation of certain offices and management in our wireless cable markets  lower bad debt expense due to improved collections  lower wireless cable marketing expenses  and a reduction in start up and general and administrative costs  principally incurred in the first quarter of  related to our broadband wireless internet business 
the reduction in overall sg a from through was partially offset by increased costs related to the development of internet access and other ip based services and related infrastructure at the end of and the beginning of  the operation of our two operating internet markets in austin and sherman denison  texas and allocable corporate overhead 
internet sg a decreased from to  primarily due to a reduction in force and related cost savings caused by a delay in availability of a next generation technology platform 
we expect overall sg a expenses to continue to decline in as wireless cable television field offices are closed and related administrative costs are reduced 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from to was primarily due to a larger number of disconnected mmds subscribers 
when subscribers are disconnected  the remaining balance of nonrecoverable equipment related to the installation of that subscriber is written off to depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from to is principally due to fewer disconnects in compared to and  to a lesser extent  the sale of used equipment during and we expect depreciation and amortization to increase in as wireless cable assets are fully depreciated  and wireless cable market operations are closed upon conversion of our wireless cable subscriber base as discussed above 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our systems and equipment  and license and leased license investment assets spectrum licenses and leases for impairment in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
events and circumstances that we considered in our review included i the expected conversion of substantially all of our wireless cable subscribers to satellite and cable programming provided by other companies  ii the need to continue evaluating the development of technology for mmds service which likely would delay deployment of new internet markets beyond  and iii the uncertainties associated with raising capital required to implement our long term business plan 
in determining whether an impairment was required for systems and equipment  we examined the future cash flows expected to be generated from these assets and the amount that we estimated could be realized for these assets in an orderly disposition  if required 
in analyzing our license and leased license investment assets  we retained the services of a third party to provide a fair market valuation 
as a result  we determined that a non cash impairment charge of million in was required to write down systems and equipment and license and leased license investments to estimated fair value  as follows systems and equipment million license and leased license investment million total million although the third party market valuation of our aggregate license and leased license investment assets was substantially in excess of our aggregate carrying cost  as required by sfas no 
we examined these assets on an individual market basis and determined that the carrying value related to ten markets should be written down in the total amount of million 
our estimates of future gross revenues and operating cash flows  the remaining estimated lives of long lived assets  or both could be reduced in the future due to changes in  among other things  technology  government regulation  available financing  or competition 
as a result  the carrying amounts of long lived assets could be reduced by additional amounts which would be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
operating loss 
we generated operating losses of million million excluding the impairment of long lived assets in  million in and million in the improvement in operating losses excluding the impairment of long lived assets from to resulted from lower programming expense  decreased marketing costs and other sg a savings discussed above  and lower depreciation and amortization expense 
the increased losses from to were primarily due to lower wireless cable revenues  additional expenditures related to testing and development of broadband wireless services  and increased depreciation related to a larger number of disconnects in increased losses for were partially offset by lower programming expense  savings from consolidation of certain offices and management in our wireless cable markets  lower wireless cable marketing costs  and lower bad debt expense 
compared to  we expect operating loss in to decrease slightly 
ebitda 
ebitda was a negative million for the year ended december   a negative  for the year ended december  and a positive million for the year ended december  the decrease in ebitda from to was primarily due to decreased wireless cable revenues resulting from fewer subscribers as we continued to shift our principal focus to developing our broadband wireless ip based services  and from start up and sg a costs related to our broadband wireless internet operations 
we expect ebitda to decrease materially from in  as we convert wireless cable subscribers and clear our spectrum for our broadband wireless internet business 
interest income 
interest income was  in  million in and million in the decrease in interest income from to was due to higher earnings during on larger unrestricted cash balances 
the increase in interest income from to was due to higher rates earned in on larger unrestricted cash balances partly resulting from cash received on the sale of our investment in wireless one  inc wireless one during average interest rates were in  in  and in interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased from to due to lower principal balances on our bta debt and capital leases 
interest expense increased slightly from to because of higher debt balances related to capital lease obligations incurred in connection with the sale and leaseback of tower sites that were sold during the fourth quarter of and the first nine months of interest rates on our capital lease obligations in were an average of 
the interest rate on other notes payable in was 
other income expense 
other income was  during  million during and  during other income in principally includes the recognition of a deferred gain on the sale and leaseback of of our towers during and and a  gain from the sale of our equity interest in a mexican mmds company 
during the first and third quarters of  we received million and  respectively  in exchange for our equity interest in wireless one 
the entire amount was recognized as other income  as our investment balance had been reduced to zero 
other income during also included the recognition of the deferred gain on the tower sale and leaseback described above 
other income in consists primarily of cash settlements from certain litigation matters 
income tax benefit 
federal income tax law related to reorganizations generally requires that the amount of income from discharge of indebtedness that occurs in connection with a chapter bankruptcy be used to reduce federal tax attributes 
generally  the reduction is applied to reduce net operating loss carryforwards  followed by other tax attributes including the basis of certain assets and the tax basis of subsidiary stock tax attribute reduction 
an election exists to reduce the basis of depreciable assets first  which can be favorable under certain circumstances 
management elected to apply the required reduction first to tax basis in depreciable assets  and then to net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of reduction in depreciable assets was approximately million 
the amount of reduction in net operating loss carryforwards was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
no income tax benefit was recorded for the years ended december   and reorganization costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in expenses related to our reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
these costs were for financial and legal advisors  accountants and administrative costs 
there were no reorganization costs in or gain on debt forgiveness 
in connection with our reorganization under chapter  on the april   effective date of our reorganization  we recorded an extraordinary gain of approximately million reflecting the extinguishment of certain liabilities subject to compromise in exchange for common stock and warrants 
upon consummation of our plan on april   our senior and convertible subordinated notes totaling approximately million  including the interest accrued thereon and associated unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs  were canceled and exchanged for million shares of newly issued common stock and warrants to acquire  shares of common stock  with a combined estimated fair value of million as of the effective date 
this extraordinary gain is not taxable to us pursuant to federal income tax law because it arose in connection with our recapitalization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
it does  however  result in a permanent tax attribute reduction 
net loss 
we have recorded net losses since our inception 
our net loss was million in million excluding the impairment of long lived assets and million in excluding the gain of million in discussed below  net loss in was million 
excluding the extraordinary gain on debt forgiveness discussed above  we incurred a net loss of million for the period from january   to the effective date and a net loss of million for the period from the effective date to december  the net loss from to was primarily impacted by the following lower wireless cable revenue and programming costs related to fewer subscribers  the impact of revising the application of sfas no 
 in cost savings from consolidation of certain market offices and management  decreased subscription television marketing expenses  the impairment of long lived assets in  a gain of million during on the exchange of our equity interest in wireless one and on the sale and leaseback of our towers  and no reorganization costs in or compared to million in loss per share for the year ended december   was per share  compared to in and for the period from the effective date to december  earnings per share information has not been presented for the predecessor period as nucentrix was recapitalized on the effective date in connection with our plan and  accordingly  per share amounts are not comparable between the predecessor period and the successor period 
compared to  we expect our net loss in to increase as wireless cable assets are fully depreciated and wireless cable market operations are closed upon conversion of our wireless cable subscriber base 
balance sheet as of december   compared to the balance sheet as of december  material changes to balance sheet accounts from to were as follows the decrease in subscriber receivables resulted primarily from a decrease of  average wireless cable subscribers 
the decrease in other receivables resulted primarily from a decrease in receivables from directv resulting from a change in the structure of certain subsidy programs and from lower installs compared to the prior year 
the decrease in systems and equipment  and license and leased license investment was due to the impairment of long lived assets 
the decrease in net other assets resulted from the elimination of an intangible asset created in fresh start accounting and from normal amortization of intangible assets 
in addition  long term restricted cash  representing restricted investments in bank certificates pledged as collateral for long term capital leases  now have less than a year to maturity and are classified as short term restricted assets 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue resulting from a change in the structure of certain subsidy programs from directv  from lower programming and subscriber related payables resulting from a lower subscriber count in the current year  and from a reduction in accrued taxes 
this was partially offset by the establishment of a canceled subscriber chargeback reserve in for through deferred revenue related to our agency relationship with directv 
the decrease in other long term liabilities is primarily due to a reclassification to current liabilities of certain tax related obligations 
liquidity and capital resources the broadband wireless business is capital intensive 
since inception  we have spent funds to lease or otherwise acquire mmds channel rights in various markets and operating systems  to construct video operating systems and two internet systems  and to finance initial system operating losses 
our primary sources of capital have been subscription fees  debt financing  the sale of common stock  and the sale of mmds spectrum rights that were not essential to our business strategy 
the approval by the fcc of the use of mmds spectrum for digital two way communications services and the fcc s flexible use authorization will allow us to use our spectrum to provide fixed  portable and  ultimately  mobile broadband wireless services such as high speed internet access services  voice over ip and wireless telecommunications services 
the growth of our business by using our spectrum to provide broadband data and voice communications services will require substantial investment in capital expenditures 
cash used in operations was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  cash used in operations during was primarily due to increased subscriber acquisition costs related to our directv agency relationship  and severance payments related to a reduction in force in the first quarter and to pay accrued property taxes and other liabilities 
cash provided by operations during included higher revenue received from our agency relationship with directv due to higher installs in cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million 
the increase in cash used in operations from to resulted primarily from recognition during of deferred agency revenue received in from our alliance with directv  and from payment of previously accrued reorganization costs 
cash used in investing activities principally relates to the acquisition and installation of subscriber equipment  the upgrade of transmission equipment in certain markets  and the acquisition of mmds spectrum rights  partially offset by the sale of mmds spectrum rights that are not a part of our strategic plan 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in investing activities during included expenditures for engineering  legal  site acquisition  and other costs related to the acquisition of mmds channel rights 
cash used in investing activities in included expenditures related to our applications for two way licenses  partially offset by million from the exchange of our equity interest in wireless one and approximately  from the sale leaseback of our communications towers 
cash used in investing activities was million in cash used in investing activities decreased from to primarily due to million received in the first nine months of from the exchange of our equity interest in wireless one 
in addition  we had lower expenditures for systems and equipment related to our wireless cable business  partially offset by higher expenditures for engineering  legal  site acquisition  and other costs related to our application for two way licenses 
cash used in financing activities was million during compared to  during and  during cash used in financing activities in was for payments on our bta debt and capital lease obligations related to the sale and leaseback of our communications towers 
cash used by financing activities during also included principal payments on our bta debt and capital lease obligations 
this was partially offset by million in cash proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash used during was for principal payments on our bta debt  capital lease obligations and other notes payable  several of which have been fully repaid  offset by million in cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
at march   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and  in restricted cash representing collateral securing various outstanding letters of credit to certain of our vendors 
as set forth in note b to the consolidated financial statements  the consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
in conjunction with its year end audit  kpmg llp  our independent accountants  has issued an audit opinion with respect to our consolidated financial statements which includes a qualification that raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
kpmg llp has stated in its report that the qualification in their report which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern is based on our history of recurring net operating losses and our resulting dependence on access to additional financing to avoid the negative cash balance that we project for the second quarter of we have discussed these two matters in item  business risk factors we are pursuing a new business that we have not previously operated on a large scale 
we may not be able to successfully implement our long term business strategy or correct our history of losses  and business risk factors we may not be able to obtain the additional financing necessary to implement our long term business strategy on satisfactory terms and conditions 
as we have described elsewhere in this report  additional capital will be required to implement our long term business plan and we likely will seek additional capital or alternative financing in the next months  we have in place a business plan that management believes will allow nucentrix to continue to operate in the normal course of business  without obtaining additional financing or deploying any new internet markets in  at least through the first quarter of  and if we are unable to obtain financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms  we have an alternative plan that management believes will allow nucentrix to continue operations at least through the second quarter of this plan would include reducing or eliminating spectrum carrying and construction costs in non strategic markets  reducing corporate overhead including personnel reductions and reducing or eliminating other discretionary expenditures 
future cash requirements our goal is to become a leading provider of advanced wireless services in our markets 
to implement our long term business strategy we intend to first offer high speed fixed and portable broadband internet access to medium sized and small businesses  sohos  telecommuters  and residential consumers in our markets 
subject to market demand  technological developments and interference regulations  a flexible use allocation in the ghz band could allow us ultimately to offer mobile g and voice services 
the growth of our business by using our spectrum to provide fixed  portable or mobile broadband internet service will require substantial investment in capital expenditures 
we expect that next generation mmds technology will provide greater coverage capabilities by addressing line of sight limitations that exist in current equipment  and will allow customers to install and upgrade customer premises equipment themselves 
these improvements should allow us to reduce subscriber related costs and operating expenses  however  the development and launch of broadband wireless mmds networks will be capital intensive  and additional capital will be required to implement our long term strategy of providing advanced wireless services in medium and small markets 
we estimate that a launch of a next generation broadband wireless system providing high speed internet access in a typical market will involve an initial expenditure of approximately  to million for network equipment  depending upon the system design and type and sophistication of the equipment 
in addition  we estimate that the acquisition and installation of each new internet subscriber will cost between and depending upon the type of customer 
this includes charges for equipment  labor and direct commissions 
this may be offset partially by installation and other up front fees 
other launch costs include the cost of securing adequate space for marketing and operational facilities  as well as costs related to employees 
as a result of these costs  operating losses are likely to be incurred by a system during the start up period 
as part of our long term plan to focus on the use of our spectrum for broadband internet and other advanced wireless services  in march we announced agreements to convert substantially all of our wireless cable subscribers to directv and time warner cable programming 
we estimate that approximately  of our subscribers will be eligible for conversion to directv programming  and approximately  subscribers will be eligible for conversion to time warner cable 
as a result of this strategic shift in the focus of our business  revenues and cash flows from our subscription television business will decline substantially as our wireless cable subscribers convert to directv  pegasus or time warner cable or otherwise disconnect their service with us 
except for a nominal residual royalty payment and recognition of deferred revenue related to cash received at the time of conversion  we do not expect our existing wireless cable subscriber base to continue to generate material revenues or cash flows for the company after march although we intend to reduce expenditures associated with our wireless cable business  ongoing costs of maintaining our fcc spectrum licenses and leases  as well as other corporate overhead  will exceed revenues as we implement the conversion program 
we are continuing to evaluate the development of technology for mmds service  the commitments by other mmds operators to specific technology platforms  the accessibility of capital markets  and the availability of other sources of financing 
however  until we are able to deploy a technology platform for which another major mmds operator has made a substantial purchase commitment  and have obtained financing on satisfactory terms and conditions  we intend to continue to look for efficiencies  maximize our cash resources and preserve strategic spectrum resources 
this likely will result in deployment of no new internet markets in we expect that cash on hand of million at march   and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations in the normal course of business at least through the first quarter of the consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
we are continuing to evaluate our near and long term capital needs  and likely will seek additional capital in the next months 
options for raising additional capital include the sale of debt or equity securities  borrowings under secured or unsecured loan arrangements  including vendor equipment financing  and sales of assets 
we can provide no assurance that such capital or financing will be available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms 
if the company is unable to obtain financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms  management has developed and intends to implement a plan that management believes will allow the company to continue operations at least through the second quarter of this plan would include reducing or eliminating spectrum carrying and construction costs in non strategic markets  reducing corporate overhead including personnel reductions and reducing or eliminating other discretionary expenditures

effects of reorganization our company and certain of our subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
subsidiaries in which we own less than of the voting stock will file separate federal income tax returns 
we have had no material state or federal income tax expense since inception 
as of december  and before taking into consideration the effects of the reorganization  we had approximately million in net operating losses for us federal income tax purposes  expiring in years through we estimate that approximately million of the above losses relate to various acquisitions and as such are subject to certain limitations 
we adopted fresh start reporting on the april   effective date of our plan in accordance with sop fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value and beginning retained earnings set to zero 
liabilities subject to compromise also were adjusted to zero in the debt discharge portion of the fresh start reporting entry 
in addition  on the effective date our outstanding common stock was canceled and newly issued shares of common stock and warrants were distributed to certain creditors in satisfaction of their claims against us 
in connection with the debt discharge  nucentrix recorded an extraordinary gain of approximately million 
federal income tax law generally requires that the amount of income from discharge of indebtedness that occurs in connection with a chapter bankruptcy be used to reduce federal tax attributes 
generally  the reduction is applied to reduce net operating loss carryforwards  followed by other tax attributes including the basis of certain assets and the tax basis of subsidiary stock 
an election exists to reduce the basis of depreciable assets first  which can be favorable under certain circumstances 
management has elected to apply the required reduction first to tax basis in depreciable assets  and then to net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of reduction in the tax basis of depreciable assets was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining basis in depreciable assets 
the amount of reduction in net operating loss carryforwards was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining net operating loss carryforwards at december  in addition to the permanent tax attribute reduction  we also must limit the annual deduction of pre bankruptcy net operating losses and built in deductions to an amount no greater than the fair market value of nucentrix immediately after the reorganization  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the annual limitation applicable to our pre bankruptcy net operating losses and built in deductions currently is estimated to be approximately million 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenues currently consist primarily of monthly fees paid by wireless cable subscribers for basic programming  premium programming  equipment rental  and other miscellaneous fees  and revenues from our agency relationship with directv which will include revenues from directv and others in from the conversion program discussed in item  business of this report 
revenues also include fees generated from internet operations in austin and sherman denison  texas 
unless the context requires otherwise  all references to subscribers or systems are to wireless cable subscribers and systems because revenues and subscribers from internet business were immaterial in approximately of consolidated revenues 
subscription revenues from wireless cable subscribers and continuing monthly service fees from directv for each directv customer generated are recognized as service is provided 
if the company does not meet minimum subscriber benchmarks each year  the directv continuing monthly service fee will be reduced 
effective january   wireless cable and directv installation revenue  and revenue received from our agency relationship with directv except for continuing monthly service fees  which are recognized as received  is recognized to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  and the remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
a chargeback reserve is recorded for all directv contingencies 
prior to  wireless cable installation revenue was offset against the nonrecoverable portion of installation costs  with the excess cost capitalized and amortized to depreciation expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
prior to  directv installation revenues cash received directly from the customer in conjunction with the sale was offset against direct incremental costs  with the resulting amount recorded as a net asset 
this asset  referred to as subscriber acquisition costs  was amortized as a component of sg a expense in proportion to the revenues projected to be generated over the expected subscriber relationship period 
revenue from our agency relationship with directv other than monthly service fees was recognized as the contingencies related to each revenue component were resolved 
a chargeback reserve was not recorded for canceled subscribers 
the company revised the application of its sfas no 
accounting for wireless cable installation and directv revenues prospectively  effective january   as discussed above 
see md a revised application of accounting policy and restatement of quarterly results 
the direct costs of wireless cable installations include reception materials and equipment on subscriber premises and installation labor  which are amortized over the useful life of the asset presently five years for the recoverable portion and the estimated average subscription term presently three years for the nonrecoverable portion of such costs 
the nonrecoverable portion of the cost of a subscriber installation becomes fully depreciated upon disconnection of the subscriber 
prior to  the company capitalized only the excess of non recoverable costs of wireless cable installations over installation revenues 
the company revised the application of its sfas no 
accounting for wireless cable non recoverable installation costs prospectively  effective january   to discontinue the netting of installation fees against nonrecoverable costs of subscriber installations 
see md a change in accounting policies and restatement of quarterly results 
our revenue recognition for wireless cable and directv installation revenue  and amortization of the recoverable portion of direct costs of wireless cable installations  is based on assumptions regarding our expected subscriber term 
the expected subscriber term of three years currently used for these purposes is based on historic subscriber churn rates 
if a different subscriber term was used  the revenue amounts reported could be materially different than amounts reported in this report  and if the subscriber term changes in future years  the amounts reported in future years would not be comparable to the years reported in this report 
the direct incremental costs incurred in generating a customer relationship with directv  comprised of material  equipment and labor  are recorded as an asset 
this asset  referred to as subscriber acquisition costs  is amortized as a component of sg a expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
our long term operating assets  which include headend and base station equipment  are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives 
our licenses and leased license investments  which include our fcc licenses and spectrum leases  are amortized from the inception of service in each market 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our long lived assets and certain intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the net asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down our systems and equipment  and license and leased license investments by a total of million 
see md a results of operations for the three years ended december  impairment of long lived assets and note to the consolidated financial statements 
revised application of accounting policy and restatement of quarterly results the company revised its application of sfas no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies sfas no 
 for its wireless cable service and directv programming service during the fourth quarter of  retroactively effective to the beginning of prior to this revision wireless cable installation revenue was offset against the nonrecoverable portion of installation costs  with the excess cost capitalized and amortized to depreciation expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years  the excess nonrecoverable costs of a wireless cable installation over installation revenue were capitalized and amortized to depreciation expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years  directv installation revenue was offset against direct incremental costs  with the resulting amount recorded as a net asset  this asset  referred to as subscriber acquisition costs  was amortized as a component of sg a expense in proportion to the revenues projected to be generated over the expected subscriber relationship period  and revenue from our agency relationship with directv other than monthly service fees was recognized as the contingencies related to each revenue component were resolved  a chargeback reserve was not recorded for canceled subscribers 
the revised application of sfas no 
resulted in the following changes to the company s accounting practices wireless cable and directv installation revenue  and revenue received from our agency relationship with directv except for continuing monthly service fees  which are recognized as received  is recognized to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  the remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years  and a chargeback reserve is recorded for all directv contingencies  and direct incremental costs incurred in generating a customer relationship with directv  comprised of material  equipment and labor  is recorded as an asset and amortized as a component of sg a expense over the expected subscriber relationship period of three years 
since the revised application of sfas no 
was retroactively effective to the beginning of  financial information for the first three quarters of has been revised 
the revised application of sfas no 
resulted in million of additional revenue in the first three quarters of also  in connection with its revised application of sfas no 
in  the company reduced revenues to establish a million chargeback reserve for canceled subscribers 
in addition  in the company adjusted the fair value of its liabilities at fresh start and correspondingly reduced revenues that had been deferred and recognized since fresh start for a net reduction in revenues in the first three quarters of million 
other miscellaneous adjustments reduced revenues in the first three quarters a total of approximately  the net effect of the company s changes on its financial results for the first  second and third quarters of  as previously reported in the company s quarterly reports on form q for such quarters  was a decrease in reported revenues from million to million in the first quarter  million to million in the second quarter  and million to million in the third quarter  an increase in reported operating loss from million to million in the first quarter  million to million in the second quarter  and million to million in the third quarter  an increase in reported net loss and net loss per basic and diluted common share from million to million in the first quarter  million to million in the second quarter  and million to million in the third quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for periods prior to  neither the revised application of sfas no 
nor the other changes discussed above had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s long term operating assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  from one to years 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
included in these operating assets are costs of headend and base station equipment  which historically have been used in the operation of our wireless cable television business 
as we implement our strategic shift in the use of our spectrum from video service to broadband wireless internet and other advanced wireless services  we expect to be able to use our headends and base stations in the provision of such services 
the company s licenses and leased license investments  which include costs incurred to acquire and or develop spectrum rights  are amortized over years beginning with the inception of service in each market since fresh start and years for those markets that existed at fresh start 
commitments and contingencies we are a party to several purported class action lawsuits alleging that we overcharged our customers for administrative late fees  breached warranties in connection with our subscription television service  and or violated various federal and state requirements relating to consumer credit and leasing transactions 
we believe the lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend them 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of these proceedings or to estimate the amounts or potential range of loss with respect to these matters  and while we do not expect such an adverse outcome  we believe that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
for a more detailed discussion of legal matters  see item  legal proceedings 
in may  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the mds  mmds and itfs spectrum licenses  lease rights and other assets of wireless cable of rockford  llc and allen leeds in rockford  illinois 
in october  the fcc dismissed the bta owner s application for consent to assign the rockford bta to the company 
as a result  the company or the bta owner may terminate the purchase agreement  or the parties may determine to modify the agreement 
in november  the bta owner filed a petition for reconsideration of the fcc s decision 
if the parties determine to proceed  the transaction will be subject to other customary closing conditions including due diligence 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations include long term debt primarily related to bta installment notes  capital lease obligations primarily related to tower leases  operating leases primarily related to spectrum leases  and other long term obligations purchase installments for spectrum license acquisitions and settlement payments  as summarized below 
payments due by year total after in thousands long term debt     capital lease obligations    operating leases      other long term obligations inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or is likely to have any significant impact on our operations 
we believe that we will be able to increase subscriber rates  if necessary  to keep pace with inflationary increases in costs 
recently issued accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic fair value based tests of the goodwill s impairment  and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
additionally  under the provision of the new accounting standard  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted by the company  as required  in fiscal year the impact of sfas on the company s financial statements has not yet been determined 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
no later than the beginning of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early applications encouraged 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities certificates of deposit 
at december   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately  with an overall weighted average return of approximately and an overall weighted average life of less than year 
the marketable securities held by us have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of december  the fair value of our long term debt at december   is estimated to be million based on the overall rate of the long term debt of and an overall maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are not currently evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we do not currently have any exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
all business transactions are in us dollars
