overview to date  our revenues and cash flows from operations have come from research collaborations with large chemical  life science and electronics companies  license of proprietary materials  sale and license of instruments and software  and government grants 
we currently have approximately life science  chemical and electronics collaborative partners and customers worldwide  including such leading companies as celanese  dow chemical  eli lilly and company  exxonmobil chemical  merck co  unilever  and sumitomo chemical 
we expect that our cash flows and revenue for will be comprised in large part of payments to be made and revenue to be earned under these and new agreements together with product and license revenue particularly from our discovery tools business 
we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation and informatics necessary to pursue high throughput discovery for proprietary materials 
these materials include polymers  phosphors and catalysts for life science applications  catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  and new materials for electronics applications 
despite challenges in the overall business climate  we met our financial goals  achieving four consecutive quarters of profitability and generating revenues of million  an increase of over we ended the year with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis 
in addition  we generated positive cash flow  ending the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
our revenue increased from million in to million in to million in operating expenses increased from million in to million in to million in our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development  including the development of new instruments and software  to enhance our technologies 
in addition  an important part of our strategy is to expand our operations and employee base  and to build our resources for research and development  business development and marketing 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 

table of contents sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy revenue from collaborations and grants consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as government grants received for proprietary materials research 
product and license revenue consists of payments from customers for products including proprietary materials  discovery tools systems and consumables as well as license fees and royalties on manual laboratory instruments and software sold under license by third parties 
we recognize revenue from the sale of discovery tools  and all costs of manufacture are expensed  once customer acceptance has been achieved 
a warranty reserve is established at the time of customer acceptance 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product and license revenue as these payments become due 
the company considers all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
accordingly  the cost of products sold as a percentage of product and license revenue will fluctuate from one period to the next based on the timing of when extended payments are due as well as the mix of products sold 
we recognize royalty revenues based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing the company s software  intellectual property and know how 
we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements and government grants as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements and grants 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we had deferred revenues of approximately million 
the terms of our collaboration agreements generally require us to perform minimum levels of research 
our sources of potential revenue for the next several years are likely to be payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  royalties from our partners based on revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements  sales of discovery tools and other instruments  licensing of software and intellectual property  and government research grants 
see notes and of notes to financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies and our collaborative agreements 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty reserve for each discovery tool system delivered 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material unfavorable impact on the company if system failures or the cost to repair a system is greater than what the company has used in estimating the warranty expense accrual 
deferred compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  in   in and million in the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees and consultants in all operating expense categories

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues our total revenues increased to million in up from million in this increase was due largely to the growth in our discovery tools business which generated million of revenue in up from million in the remainder of the increase in revenue was attributable to the addition of new research collaborations 
the company segregates revenue by industry collaborations  proprietary materials and discovery tools 
industry collaboration revenue is further segregated into four categories for purposes of internal management reporting chemicals  industrial polymers  electronic materials  and life sciences and for includes a  license fee that is included in product and license revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 
years ended december  in thousands industry collaborations chemicals industrial polymers electronic materials life sciences proprietary materials life sciences discovery tools total the increase in industry collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was largely attributable to new research collaborations initiated with chemical companies such as exxonmobil and life science companies such as merck 
applied biosystems  bayer  celanese  exxonmobil and the dow chemical company accounted for    and of total revenue for the months ended december   and    and of revenue for the same period in revenue from research collaborations exceeded research and development costs for the year ended december  primarily because of increasing research contract profitability 
the excess of research and development costs over research revenue during the year ended december  was primarily due to the research costs associated with internal projects in our proprietary materials business and the development costs associated with the initiation of our discovery tools business 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million for the twelve month period ended december  compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in cost of products sold in the twelve month period ended december  was largely attributable to the discovery tools polyolefins systems delivered to exxonmobil chemical company  the discovery tools rapidlgpc tm system delivered to girsa and the discovery tools polymerization systems delivered to both girsa and sumitomo chemical company  ltd 
we have had limited sales of discovery tools systems and consumables to date  and the cost of products sold is expected to fluctuate from period to period and will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volumes in each period 

table of contents research and development expenses the company has entered into a number of research and development collaborations to perform research for customers in exclusive fields 
the major collaborative arrangements all have similar contractual terms 
under the collaborative arrangements  symyx is responsible for performing research at levels of either full time equivalent staffing or number of experiments as defined in the agreements 
the collaborative partner is entitled to develop and commercialize materials discovered in or under collaboration within the defined field 
symyx typically receives research and development funding at specified amounts per full time equivalent employee working on the project or on a per experiment fee basis and is entitled to receive royalties on the sale of any products commercialized under the agreement or payments on the achievement of specified research milestones by the company or its collaborative partners 
the agreements also contain procedures by which the company and the customer will determine royalty rates for the sale or license of products under the agreements 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom symyx conducted research and development  together with the primary focus of the collaborations and the date upon which the current contract ends 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between symyx and the collaborative partner 
current research partner contract ends primary focus of collaborative efforts bayer polyolefins  commodity chemicals celanese catalysts for commodity chemicals dow chemical polyolefins and pharmaceutical intermediates merck workflow for rapid discovery  identification and characterization of novel crystalline salt and polymorphic forms of drug candidates we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate based on full time equivalent fte effort  that approximately of research development efforts in were undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort was on our own internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business 
due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  depreciation of facilities  and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in was due primarily to increases in salaries and other personnel related costs  facilities costs and chemical and scientific supplies costs to support our additional collaborative and internal research efforts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in outside research and consultant costs and the deferred compensation charge 
research and development expenses represented of service revenues in and of service revenues in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to revenue increases associated with the addition of significant contracts and a reduction in outside research and consultant costs in our core businesses are research to discover new materials and the sale of instruments and related software licenses 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal 
table of contents and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in expenses increased primarily due to the addition of a number of business development personnel  increased salaries and other personnel related costs due to additional staffing necessary to manage and support our growth 
general and administrative expenses also increased due to an increase in travel costs related mainly to business development and sales efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation charge 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we expand our business development and administrative staff  add facilities  and incur escalating costs related to being a public company such as directors and officers insurance and professional fees 
net interest income expense net interest income expense represents interest income earned on our cash and available for sale securities net of interest expense on equipment financing loans 
interest income decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to lower interest rates in we anticipate that our interest income in will be significantly lower than  due to our higher yielding securities being progressively replaced  on either maturity or sale  with securities yielding substantially lower interest rates in interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease was due to a reduction in the outstanding balances of equipment financing loans used to partially fund our original acquisition of equipment 
at december  we had fully repaid amounts owed under these equipment financing loans 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the provision differs from the expected tax liability at a statutory rate primarily due to the realization of previously unbenefited deferred tax assets 
we expect our average tax rate for to be significantly higher than our average rate as we have now realized the majority of the benefits related to previously incurred net operating losses 
there was no provision for income taxes for the year ended december  due to operating losses 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to revenue that has been recognized for income tax purposes but deferred for financial reporting purposes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in  if not utilized 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets includes approximately million attributable to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity upon realization 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
years ended december  and revenues our total revenues increased to million in  up from million in this increase was due primarily to the introduction of our discovery tools business which generated million of revenue in together with a development candidate transfer fee which provided revenue of million in the 
table of contents remainder of the increase in revenue was attributable to the addition of new and expanded research collaborations with companies in the chemicals  industrial polymers and life science industries  partially offset by the conclusion of the siemens electronic materials collaboration and a lower level of funding received by our electronic materials group from government grants 
years ended december  in thousands industry collaborations chemicals industrial polymers electronic materials life sciences proprietary materials life sciences discovery tools total applied biosystems  bayer  celanese and the dow chemical company accounted for   and of total revenue for the months ended december   and   and of revenue for the same period in revenue from research collaborations was less than research and development expense for the year ended december  due primarily to the research costs associated with internal projects primarily in our proprietary materials business and the development costs associated with the introduction of our discovery tools business 
the excess of revenue over research and development costs during the year ended december  was primarily because we did not incur significant costs in our discovery tools and proprietary materials businesses 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million for the twelve month period ended december  there was no product revenue and therefore no cost of products sold for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in cost of products sold was due directly to the introduction of the discovery tools business  which first resulted in product revenue in the year the company has limited sales of discovery tools systems and consumables to date  and the cost of products sold is expected to fluctuate from period to period and will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volumes in each period

in prior years  we had financed our operations primarily through research and development funding from collaborative partners  net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and  prior to the initial public offering  private placements of preferred stock totaling million  and to a lesser extent  equipment financing loans 
our operating activities provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales  partially offset by operating expenses 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities and purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment were million in  million in and million in we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations
