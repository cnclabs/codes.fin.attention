in this increase was partially offset by a decrease  relative to revenues  in salaries  wages and employee benefits other than driver wages 
the percentage increase  relative to revenues  in operations and maintenance cost was primarily the result of a increase in purchased transportation expense from million in to million in resulting from revenues derived from the logistics division and operations in mexico 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in fuel cost resulting from a 
decrease in the average price per gallon in from and an improvement in fuel efficiency to miles per gallon in from miles per gallon in fuel efficiency is affected by several factors including tractor idle time management  driver quality  engine technology and weather conditions in north america

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percent of revenue  resulted from a increase in tractor utilization from to  as mentioned above  and a increase in net revenue per mile partially offset by slightly higher depreciation rates on certain groups of equipment see item business revenue equipment acquisition program above 
the decrease in other expenses  as a percentage of revenue  resulted primarily from reduced recruiting and training costs brought about by a lower driver turnover rate and a more competitive driver compensation program 
as a result of the foregoing factors  operating income increased to million  or of revenue  in from million or  of revenues  in interest expense decreased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from significantly lower outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates

although the company competes primarily on the basis of its service provided to its customers rather than rates charged  rate discounting continues to be a factor in obtaining and retaining business 
the number of firms competing in the truckload segment of the industry has increased dramatically since the deregulation of the industry in also  a depressed economy tends to increase the competitive pressure placed on rate and service from alternative modes of transportation such as less than truckload and railroads 
the company s management believes that the truckload segment of the market has reached a certain level of maturity as the market exists currently and that the company s further growth in the truckload segment of the industry is likely to be attained by increasing its market share rather than through an increase in the overall size of the market

the increase in other expenses  as a percentage of revenue  resulted primarily from higher recruiting and training costs brought about by a higher driver turnover rate and increased competition for drivers 
the percentage decrease  relative to salaries  wages and employee benefits expense for compared to was due to the reduction in management and executive incentives for  which are based on the profitability of the company  the effects of fuel surcharges and the elimination of a substantial portion of drivers incentives earned during the fourth quarter of which resulted from a change in the drivers pay package  except for drivers in the company s dedicated services division  that eliminated incentive pay and overall  increased mileage based pay by

most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with increases in inflation generally resulting in increased operating costs and expenses 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on the company s overall operating costs would not be expected to be greater for the company than for its competitors 
seasonality in the trucking industry generally  revenues decrease as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses increase  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs 
future revenues could be impacted if customers reduce shipments due to temporary plant closings  which historically have occurred during july and december 
fuel availability and cost the motor carrier industry is dependent upon the availability of diesel fuel  and fuel shortages or increases in fuel taxes or fuel costs have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect the profitability of usa truck  inc 
fuel prices have fluctuated widely and fuel taxes have generally increased in recent years 
the company has not experienced difficulty in maintaining necessary fuel supplies  and in the past the company generally has been able to recover most of the increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes from customers through increased freight rates 
diesel prices decreased during  but there can be no assurance that diesel prices will remain at price levels experienced in recent periods 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover any future increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes through increased rates
