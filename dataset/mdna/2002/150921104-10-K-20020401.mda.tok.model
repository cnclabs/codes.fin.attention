item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in april  cell genesys  inc cell genesys or the company has focused its research and product development efforts on human disease therapies that are based on innovative gene modification technologies 
the company s strategic objective is to develop and commercialize cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and gene therapies to treat cancer and other major  life threatening diseases 
cell genesys current clinical programs include gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies 
gvax cancer vaccines are in phase ii studies for lung cancer  prostate cancer  pancreatic cancer  and leukemia and in phase i ii studies for multiple myeloma 
the company expects to initiate a phase iii trial for gvax lung cancer vaccine in late and a phase iii trial for gvax prostate cancer vaccine during clinical programs evaluating the company s oncolytic virus therapies include a phase ii study of cg  an intratumorally administered product for early stage prostate cancer  and a phase i ii study of cg  an intravenously administered therapy for late stage prostate cancer 
in addition  cell genesys has preclinical oncolytic virus programs evaluating potential therapies for liver cancer  colon cancer and bladder cancer as well as preclinical gene therapy programs evaluating potential therapies for multiple types of cancer and hemophilia 
additionally  cell genesys has a majority owned subsidiary  ceregene inc  which is focused on gene therapies for central nervous system disorders  and also continues to hold approximately nine million shares of common stock of its former subsidiary  abgenix nasdaq abgx  which is focused on the development and commercialization of antibody therapies 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
revenue recognition since the company s inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and other payments where we continue involvement through development is recognized ratably over the development period 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under these collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred 
incentive milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process because the company has no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to cell genesys  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments received that has not been earned 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates in the financial statements include  but are not limited to accrued but unbilled expenses in clinical trails  outside experts and consultants including legal and accounting fees  useful lives of property and equipment  and other items 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in revenues for were derived primarily from the company s gvax collaboration 
during  the company recognized million in milestone payments related to clinical progress in the gvax lung program 
also during  the company restructured its gvax collaboration to regain full rights to its gvax prostate cancer vaccine program and converted its gvax lung program to a reciprocal royalty arrangement 
this restructuring will result in lower collaboration reimbursements relating to the gvax prostate program  but reimbursements relating to the gvax lung program are not affected by the restructuring and are likely to increase as associated costs increase 
revenues for were impacted by the adoption of sab and the resulting change in the company s revenue recognition policy 
as a result of the adoption of sab a cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million  net of taxes  was recorded in see the revenue recognition note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our adoption of sab 
revenues for included a non recurring payment of million received in connection with the termination of the company s aids gene therapy collaboration agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals formerly hoechst marion roussel in september the company s gene activation technology agreement with aventis for gene activated erythropoietin epo provides for milestone payments and annual maintenance fees  in addition to royalties on future sales of potential gene activated protein products 
the company recognized revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively  pursuant to the aventis agreement 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million during  from million in and million in the increase can be attributed primarily to the company s expanding clinical trials for both its gvax cancer vaccines and the addition of oncolytic virus therapy programs 
during  the company advanced its research and development through clinical trial programs including trials of gvax vaccines in multiple cancers as well as in the oncolytic virus therapies as well as preclinical programs including cancer and hemophilia 
the relatively low amount spent in was primarily the result of a corporate restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of as well as the discontinuance of the aids gene therapy program 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in future years to support expanded  more advanced and more numerous clinical trials and additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
biopharmaceutical products such as those that we develop generally take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an investigational drug application which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii  and iii 
costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have three products in development that have been targeted for phase iii studies 
however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to a biologic license application  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see other factors affecting future operations below 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
timing of completion of these trials is based on typical times to completion for trials at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see other factors affecting future operations below 
product indication phase of development estimated completion of phase gvax lung non small cell lung cancer phase ii gvax prostate prostate cancer phase ii gvax panceatic pancreatic cancer phase ii gvax leukemia acute leukemia phase ii gvax myeloma multiple myeloma phase i ii cv oncolytic virus prostate cancer phase ii cv oncolytic virus prostate cancer phase i general and administrative expenses were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase resulted from additional headcount and facility infrastructure to support expanding preclinical and clinical programs including facilities added during future spending for general and administrative costs is expected to continue to increase in future years to support the growing infrastructure needs of the company  particularly in the area of facilities 
operating expenses were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in included the non recurring charge for purchased in process research and development of million resulted from the acquisition of calydon 
in january  the company created a new subsidiary  ceregene  inc  which is focused on gene therapies for neurologic disorders such as alzheimer s disease and parkinson s disease 
the company contributed million cash and access to technology and patents in the central nervous system cns gene therapy area  in exchange for approximately percent ownership of the new company 
ceregene s financial statements are currently consolidated into the operations of the company  but this may change should the company s ownership position be decreased as a result of outside financing by ceregene 
abgenix  inc  a former subsidiary of the company  was fully consolidated in the company s financial statements prior to july  as a result of abgenix s ipo on july   the company s ownership percentage was reduced to less than percent  and abgenix was accounted for under the equity method of accounting from that date to november in  the sale of abgenix stock resulted in million realized gain 
in november  abgenix completed a public offering of million shares and a private placement of million shares of its common stock  further reducing cell genesys ownership to approximately percent 
consequently  from november forward  the company has accounted for its investment in abgenix as equity securities which are considered available for sale in accordance with sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
interest and other income was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the higher income in compared to is a result of higher average cash balances  plus million realized gains earned from converting a portion of the investment portfolio from tax free securities to taxable securities during the first quarter of  partially offset by lower market interest rates in compared with prior years 
in  the company realized gains on sales of abgenix stock of million 
the company did not sell any abgenix common stock during interest expense increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in the slight increase from is a result of additional capital leases resulting from the acquisition of calydon in the third quarter of the decrease from reflects expired capital leases and repayment of a million tenant improvement loan in march interest expense is expected to increase in future years as a result of a million liquid collateral debt financing completed in december in connection with the construction of the company s manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
cell genesys net loss was million in  compared to net income of million in and net loss of million in the loss for was due to the million charge for purchased in process research and development from the calydon acquisition and increased research and development expenses in advancing clinical and preclinical programs 
the net income for was primarily due to a million gain realized on sales of abgenix common stock  net of tax  partially offset by a million  net of tax  revenue adjustment under the cumulative effect of accounting change following the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab during the first quarter of the loss in was primarily due to a one time merger termination charge of million in december losses  excluding non recurring charges and gains from sales of abgenix stock  are expected to continue and may increase in future years as operating expenses rise  particularly as the company incurs expenses related to manufacturing and late stage human testing of its potential products 
the company recorded a tax benefit for of million  which represents the estimated refund available from the carryback of s losses to offset taxable income in at december   cell genesys had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
the large capital gains associated with the sale of a portion of the company s investment in abgenix during february and november were substantially offset by utilizing a large portion of the company s previously available net operating loss carryovers and tax credits 
in process research and development on september  the company announced that it had completed the acquisition of calydon  inc  a private biotechnology company focused on the treatment of cancer using genetically engineered oncolytic viruses  for approximately million in cell genesys stock and other consideration and assumption of approximately million in liabilities  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition provided cell genesys with a third product platform in addition to cancer vaccines and cancer gene therapies as well as a product  cg  for early stage prostate cancer that is a potential candidate for phase iii clinical trials 
the company engaged the services of an outside consulting firm to estimate the value of the acquired assets 
approximately million of the total purchase price represented the value of in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future uses and was charged to our operations in the third quarter ended september  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of calydon are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from september the million in process research and development charge represents the value using a discounted cash flow methodology  attributable to the in process research and development of calydon based on a valuation analysis of such research and development 
in process technology was expensed upon acquisition as technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the charge relates to specific on going research and development 
management believes that the allocation of the purchase price to in process research and development is appropriate given the future potential of this research and development to contribute to our operations 
assuming this research continues through all stages of clinical development  we project substantial future research and development expenditures related to this technology 
liquidity and capital resources cell genesys ended with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which million is classified as restricted cash 
information regarding the classification of these assets is included in notes to financial statements  fair value of financial instruments 
the company has maintained its financial position through strategic management of its resources including the company s holdings in abgenix of which cell genesys continues to hold approximately million shares of common stock and by relying on funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
additionally  in late  cell genesys secured a million asset backed financing in connection with the construction of the company s manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
cell genesys has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements  sale of abgenix common stock and secured financing 
in february and november  the company received an aggregate of million in net proceeds for the sale of shares of abgenix common stock 
from inception through february   the company received million in net proceeds from cell genesys equity financings  million under collaborative agreements and million from property and secured financings 
in connection with the gain on sale of abgenix common stock in  the company paid million in federal and state income tax 
the company recorded a tax benefit for of million  which represents the estimated refund available from the carryback of s losses to offset taxable income in the company has additional unutilized nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of these nol carryforwards is limited by irs regulation section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income that can be offset by nols following a change in control 
the company  for irs purposes  experienced a change in control during its acquisition of somatix in it is the company s current intention to minimize future tax liabilities on sales of abgenix stock by offsetting gains against current operating losses and the nol carryfowards allowed under section in addition  the company has certain research and development tax credits which it may utilize to offset such gains 
however  under some circumstances the company may sell more abgenix stock and consequently recognize more gain than it may be able to shelter from tax using these methods 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases and an asset backed debt financing at december   were in thousands operating debt leases financing years ending december and beyond   total minimum lease payment   less amount representing interest  present value of future lease payments  cell genesys currently has three facilities under construction and at various stages of completion 
the company s manufacturing facility for cell based vaccines located in hayward  california  is expected to be completed in late expenditures associated with the completion and validation of this facility during are expected to total approximately to million 
in addition  the company recently announced the opening of a new manufacturing facility in memphis  tennessee that will be devoted to the manufacture of patient specific cancer vaccines for non small cell lung cancer  in support of phase iii trials expected to commence late in total costs for equipment and improvements for this facility are expected to approximate million in finally  in the company announced that it had signed a lease with a purchase option for a new facility in south san francisco  intended to serve as the company s new corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
construction of this new facility began in  and total payments for build out of tenant improvements during are expected to be approximately to million 
cell genesys anticipates that fiscal year cash usage will not exceed approximately million 
operating cash usage does not include any potential offset from sales of abgenix stock or usage for capital expenditures or any potential acquisitions 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the attraction of collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  the cost of litigation  and patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings or their resolution 
nonetheless  the company s ongoing development programs and any increase in the number of programs will reduce the current cash resources and potentially create the need to raise further capital 
therefore  the company may continue to consider financing alternatives  including the potential sale of additional shares of abgenix stock and debt financings 
a substantial portion of the company s working capital consists of shares maintained in its former subsidiary  abgenix 
these shares are carried at market value and have been subject to extreme fluctuation in recent quarters due to the highly volatile nature of the market price of abgenix stock 
to the extent that we continue to hold a substantial amount of these shares  our working capital position can be expected to continue to fluctuate in future periods 
while the company believes that its current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next year and beyond  it anticipates entertaining the possibility of raising additional capital in advance of actual capital expenditures to preserve its liquidity 
therefore  liquidity and volatility of capital markets play a significant role in the decision to raise capital 
the types of financing available to the company include the sale of abgenix securities  asset backed debt financing and private or public placement of cell genesys equity securities 
the company s evaluation processes regularly consider the liquidity of capital markets  dilution  shareholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on stockholders 
certain of the financing options available to the company have some type of negative consequence to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a slightly negative future consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements business combinations in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june   including the company s acquisition of calydon  inc in september sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the standard also establishes specific guidance for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal year the company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
asset retirement obligations in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the company is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas  which will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending december  asset impairments in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal year and will be applied prospectively 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
in addition  these risks are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our products are in developmental stage  are not approved for commercial sale and might not receive regulatory approval or become commercially viable 
all of our potential cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and gene therapy products are in research and development 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales for at least the next several years 
our products currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will be successful or that any of our future products will ultimately be commercially successful 
even if developed  our products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit us to operate profitably 
our cancer vaccine and gene therapy programs depend on new and unproven technologies 
gene therapy is a new technology 
existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of gene therapy are limited 
data relating to our specific gene therapy approaches are also limited 
our gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies are currently being tested in phase i ii and phase ii human clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy 
none of our other products or therapies under development are in human clinical trials 
the results of preclinical studies do not predict safety or efficacy in humans 
possible side effects of gene therapy may be serious and potentially life threatening 
unacceptable side effects may be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of our potential products or thereafter 
there are many reasons that potential products that appear promising at an early stage of research or development do not result in commercially successful products 
although we are testing proposed products or therapies in human clinical trials  we cannot guarantee that we will be permitted to undertake human clinical trials for any of our other products 
also  the results of this testing might not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of these products 
even if clinical trials are successful  we might not obtain regulatory approval for any indication 
finally  even if our products proceed successfully through clinical trials and receive regulatory approval  there is no guarantee that an approved product can be manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or that such a product will be successfully marketed 
we have not been profitable in our operations absent the gains on sales of abgenix stock and may not become profitable in the future 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit since our inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  compared with million at december  for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million including a charge for purchased in process technology for million as a result of the calydon acquisition 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years due primarily to the expansion of research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing and to a lesser extent  from general and administrative expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market any products 
we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve or sustain product revenues or profitability 
we may have a need for substantial additional funds 
we will need substantial funds for existing and planned preclinical and clinical trials  to continue research and development activities  and to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products we may develop 
at some point in the future  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  such as continued scientific progress of research and development programs magnitude of such programs expenses progress of preclinical and clinical testing time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent claims competing technological and market developments changes in collaborative relationships with japan tobacco and others terms of any additional collaborative arrangements into which we may enter our ability to establish research  development and commercialization arrangements pertaining to products other than those covered by existing collaborative arrangements cost of establishing manufacturing facilities cost of commercialization activities demand for our products  if and when approved potential redemption obligations in connection with conversion of the series b preferred stock our ability to realize the carrying value of the abgenix stock due to its volatility we expect to be able to raise additional funds through collaborative relationships  sales of some portion or all of our investment in abgenix  additional equity or debt financings  or otherwise 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
there can be no assurance that any such additional funding will be available to us  or  if available  that it will be on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  stockholders will incur immediate dilution 
there can be no assurance that opportunities for in licensing technologies or for third party collaborations will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research  development and clinical activities 
alternatively  we may need to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
we rely heavily on the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including cell genesys  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
cell genesys currently has approximately issued or granted patents and approximately pending applications 
although we are prosecuting patent applications  we cannot be certain whether any given application will result in the issuance of a patent or  if any patent is issued  whether it will provide significant proprietary protection or will be invalidated 
also  patent applications in the united states are confidential until patents are issued 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching licenses granted to us 
the company is aware of competing intellectual property relating to both its programs in cancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses 
while the company currently believes it has freedom to operate in these areas  there can be no assurance that its position will not be challenged by others in the future 
we may be required to obtain licenses to certain third party technologies or genes necessary in order to market our products 
any failure to license any technologies or genes required to commercialize our technologies or products at reasonable cost may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may also have to engage in litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  to enforce our patents  or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
to determine the priority of inventions  the united states patent and trademark office frequently declares interference proceedings 
in europe  other patents can be revoked through opposition proceedings 
such proceedings could result in an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions 
we are currently involved in multiple interference and or opposition proceedings with regard to gene activation technology certain ex vivo gene therapies certain vector technologies chimeric receptor technology we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property position in these areas and on our business as a whole 
we may be involved in other interference and or opposition proceedings in the future 
we believe that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and to maintain our competitive position 
our competitors may independently develop similar or better proprietary information and techniques and disclose them publicly 
also  there can be no assurance that others will not gain access to our trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets 
we require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to an individual during the course of the employment or consulting relationship generally must be kept confidential 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the employee while employed by us relating to our business are our exclusive property 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the fields of cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus and gene therapy are highly competitive 
competition in the field from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and from research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase 
in many instances  we compete with other commercial entities in acquiring products or technology from universities 
there are numerous competitors working on products to treat each of the diseases for which we are seeking to develop therapeutic products 
some competitors are pursuing a product development strategy competitive with ours  particularly with respect to our cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
certain of these competitive products are in more advanced stages of product development and clinical trials 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours  or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
some of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products  in obtaining united states food and drug administration fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and in manufacturing and marketing such products 
accordingly  our competitors may obtain patent protection or fda approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain certain biological materials necessary to support our research  development or manufacturing of any of our planned therapies 
if we are permitted to commence commercial sales of products  we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency  areas in which we have limited or no experience 
we expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  on product efficacy price safety reliability availability patent protection sales  marketing and distribution capabilities our competitive positions also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient funding for the often lengthy period between product conception and commercial sales 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the stock prices of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including cell genesys have historically been highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors may affect our stock price fluctuations in our financial results announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or our competitors announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of our or our competitors products developments in patent or other proprietary rights affecting us or our competitors public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies general market conditions fluctuations in the price of abgenix stock severe fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market in general which are unrelated to our operating performance issuance of common stock upon conversion of the series b preferred stock future sales of such common stock or other shares of common stock by existing stockholders the perception that such issuances or sales could occur our business is subject to extensive regulation and any failure to obtain required regulatory approvals could prevent or delay the commercialization of our products 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and foreign countries is important in the manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and our research and development activities 
all of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other premarket approval procedures by the fda and similar authorities in foreign countries 
since our potential products involve the application of new technologies  regulatory approvals may take longer than for products produced using more conventional methods with which these regulatory agencies are more familiar and comfortable 
various federal and  in some cases  state laws also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of these products 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal laws  requires significant expenditures 
any delay or failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain regulatory approvals could hinder the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
in responding to a new drug application  or a product license application  the fda may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or if granted may not cover all the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval 
also  an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
in addition to laws and regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under occupational safety and health act environmental protection act toxic substances control act resource conservation and recovery act other present and potential future federal  state or local laws and regulations our manufacturing facilities are subject to licensing requirements of the california department of health services 
while not subject to license by the fda  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda as well as by the california department of health services 
a separate license from the fda is required for commercial manufacture of any product 
failure to maintain these licenses or to meet the inspection criteria of the fda and the california department of health services would disrupt our manufacturing processes and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
for marketing outside the united states  we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs and devices 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop these markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our product development activities involve the use of hazardous materials and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with environmental laws 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury  by accident or as the results of intentional acts of terrorists  from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any resulting liability could exceed our resources 
we may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
we may depend on our strategic partners for the sales  marketing and distribution of our future products 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
we may need to rely on sales and marketing expertise of potential corporate partners for our initial products 
the decision to market future products directly or through corporate partners will be based on a number of factors  including market size and concentration size and expertise of the partner s sales force in a particular market our overall strategic objectives we may in the future be exposed to product liability claims and may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our potential products may expose us to liability claims resulting from the use of our products 
these claims might be made by consumers  health care providers or by others selling our products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with respect to each of our clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance or that sufficient coverage can be acquired at a reasonable cost 
an inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost  or at all  could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing or commercialization of our products or otherwise affect our financial condition 
a product liability claim or recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
sales of our future products will be influenced by the willingness of third party payers to provide reimbursement 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our potential products will depend in part upon coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  including government agencies private health care insurers and other health care payers such as health maintenance organizations self insured employee plans blue cross blue shield and similar plans there is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
in particular  reimbursement from government agencies  insurers and large health organizations may become more restricted in the future 
our potential products represent a new mode of therapy and  while the cost benefit ratio of the products may be favorable  we expect that the costs associated with our products will be substantial 
there can be no assurance that our proposed products  if successfully developed  will be considered cost effective by third party payers 
insurance coverage might not be provided by third party payers at all or without substantial delay 
even if such coverage is provided  the approved reimbursement might not provide sufficient funds to enable us to become profitable 
the pricing of our future products may be influenced in part by government controls 
the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may impair future revenues and profitability of biotechnology companies 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control 
while we cannot predict whether the government will adopt any such legislative or regulatory proposals  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we depend on our key technical and management personnel and collaborative partners to advance our technology  and the loss of these personnel or partners could impair the development of our products 
we rely and will continue to rely on our key management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
there is intense competition from other companies  research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we will need to continue to recruit experts in the areas of clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel 
if we do not succeed in recruiting such personnel or developing such expertise  our business could suffer significantly 
we have clinical trial agreements with a number of public and private medical institutions relating to the conduct of human clinical trials for our gvax cancer vaccine programs and oncolytic virus therapies 
the early termination of any of these clinical trial agreements would hinder the progress of our clinical trials 
if any of these relationships are terminated  the clinical trials might not be completed and the results might not be evaluated 
we rely on the continued availability of outside scientific collaborators performing research 
these relationships generally may be terminated at any time by the collaborator  typically by giving days notice 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to our activities 
our agreements with these collaborators  as well as those with our scientific consultants  provide that any rights we obtain as a result of their research efforts will be subject to the rights of the research institutions in such work 
in addition  some of these collaborators have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may potentially conflict with their obligations to us 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that inventions or processes discovered by our scientific collaborators or consultants will become our property 
cell genesys stockholders may be diluted by the exercise of outstanding stock options  the conversion of outstanding series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or other issuances of our common stock 
substantially all the outstanding shares of cell genesys common stock are eligible for sale in the public market 
conversion of the series b preferred stock or exercise of outstanding stock options would result in issuance of additional shares of common stock  diluting existing investors 
the number of shares of common stock issued  and therefore the dilution of existing investors  would increase as a result of either i an event triggering the antidilution rights of any outstanding shares of series b preferred stock  or ii a decline in the market price of the company s common stock immediately prior to conversion of the series b preferred stock 
the holders of the series b preferred stock may choose at any time to convert their shares into common stock 
in that event  the number of shares of common stock issued would be based on the lower of a fixed conversion price of per share for the remaining shares from the original issue of million face value preferred stock and per share for the shares issued january from call options or the average of certain trading prices during the trading days preceding such date of conversion 
as of december   the market price of cell genesys common stock traded above the two fixed conversion price of and 
consequently  the conversion rate for the shares is based on the fixed conversion price 
as of december   the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock issued in november were convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock  while the outstanding shares issued in january were convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock 
as the market price declines below the fixed conversion rate  the greater the decline in the market price  the greater the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock 
following the issuance of the new preferred shares in  no further call options remain outstanding 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption of fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist activity and other events beyond our control 
our facilities in california have  in the past  been subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event that these or other of our facilities are subject to future blackouts  they could disrupt the operations of the affected facilities 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price is greatly influenced by the market price of abgenix stock  which has been highly volatile 
our retained ownership of approximately million abgenix shares represents a material portion of the total assets on our balance sheet 
abgenix stock prices have proven to be highly volatile 
the value of our million shares of abgenix stock was approximately million at december  versus approximately million at december  movements in the price of abgenix stock  up or down  exert corresponding influences on the market price of our stock 
our business could suffer as a result of our strategic acquisitions and investments 
in january  the company acquired the principal operating assets of chiron corporation s gene therapy business  a fully equipped and staffed manufacturing facility 
also in january  we launched ceregene  inc  formed through the acquisition of neurologic gene therapeutics  a private san diego based start up company 
finally  in august  we acquired calydon  inc  a private biotechnology company focused on the treatment of cancer using genetically engineered oncolytic viruses 
we may not be able to fully integrate all these companies  their intellectual property or personnel  and our attempts to do so will place additional burdens on our management and infrastructure 
these acquisitions will subject us to a number of risks  including the loss of key personnel and business relationships  difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating the new personnel and operations of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the expense associated with maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders  or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investments in related businesses  products or technologies 
future acquisitions could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities or the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities 
there can be no assurance that any strategic acquisition or investment will succeed 
any future acquisition or investment could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
