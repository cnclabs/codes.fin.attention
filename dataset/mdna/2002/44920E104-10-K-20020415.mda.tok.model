item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in view of the evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that a description of our revenues and operating results is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our current business plan assumes that we will not derive any significant revenues from advertising or other activities during the first half of  or even later 
our business plan further assumes that  subject to cash flow availability  we will continue to invest in and disburse substantial funds to continue current operations and to develop our single network of special interest  continuously streaming broadband entertainment channels  for which purpose we will require additional capital investments 
remaining a going concern will require additional financing until such time as sufficient cash flows are generated from operations 
anticipated non interest bearing loans from an affiliated person  together with our limited current cash resources and operating revenues  are expected to be able to support our operations through the end of the second quarter of the year we will need to obtain substantial additional financing in order to continue and expand our operations and to sustain our cash flow needs 
we do not know if additional financing  in excess of what is currently anticipated  will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we would incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage ownership of all holders of common stock 
if we do raise more equity capital in the future  it is likely that it will result in substantial dilution to our present stockholders 
any inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail or cease business operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december   year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  on revenues of  derived from licensing and advertising fees and from our sale of pls encoding mechanisms 
our net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million upon revenues of  derived from licensing and advertising fees 
our net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million on revenues of  derived from advertising and the production of infomercials 
production costs for the development of our original content for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to approximately million and million for the two preceding years  respectively  reflecting the cessation of our own content production efforts in production costs include i data communications  ii software license fees  iii content license fees  where necessary in order to acquire additional content  and iv expenses of hiring and compensating employees who handle production and delivery of our content 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of approximately million in personnel costs   in professional and consulting fees   in equipment and depreciation   in sales and marketing costs  and  in other general and administrative costs 
by way of comparison  expenditures for each of these categories were million     and approximately million  respectively  for the year ended december  internet domain and web service costs  together with miscellaneous expenses  accounted for the balance in each of the two years ended december  our selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of  in personnel costs   in professional and consulting fees   in rent  overhead  equipment and depreciation   in sales and marketing costs  and  in other general and administrative costs 
internet domain and web service costs  together with miscellaneous expenses  accounted for the balance 
we incurred depreciation and amortization expense of   and  for the years ended  respectively  december   and this was derived primarily from depreciation relating to our leasehold improvements and furniture  computer and camera equipment purchases 
our net loss for the year ended december  included writedowns of  in fixed assets and  representing a portion of our equity investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary  as well as a  writeoff of capitalized software development costs 
our net loss for the year ended december  includes a fixed asset write down of  primarily attributable to the closure of our paris  france facility and the relocation of our operations from new york city to miami beach  florida  offset in part by interest income of  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities in our initial public offering  from several private placements and by means of non interest bearing loans and capital contributions from an affiliated person 
net proceeds from these sales have totaled approximately million  with million raised in the initial public offering and the balance raised in the private placements 
for the year ended december   we used approximately million in connection with our operating activities 
such amount was primarily attributable to net losses  offset in part by common stock and options issued for services  increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue  and depreciation  amortization and unearned compensation expenses 
for the year ended december   approximately  and million was provided by investing activities and financing activities  respectively 
we believe that continuation and growth of our operations will depend largely on our ability to become a leading source for continuously streaming media entertainment niche programming on the internet 
during the year ended december   we continued to invest in and incur significant expenditures and costs to achieve this goal 
accordingly  we intend to continue to make significant investments to acquire content  to increase the number of viewers of our sls channels  to attract advertisers for our sls channels  to ensure that the technology needed to provide our content stays current and to sell our pls technology at december   we had  in cash which we believe  together with anticipated non interest bearing loans and or additional capital contributions from an affiliated person and our limited operating revenues  will support our operations through the end of the third quarter of we will require substantial additional financing to remain a going concern and to expand our operations 
we do not know if additional financing  in excess of what is currently anticipated  will be available to us or  if it is available  whether it will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
any inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail or cease business operations 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis above contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us and to our present and future business operations within the meaning of federal securities law 
we have identified these statements by using forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  predict  contemplate  continue  believe  intend  the negative of the foregoing words  or other similar words 
these words  however  are not the exclusive means by which you can identify these statements 
you can also identify forward looking statements because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or of financial conditions  characterize future events or circumstances or state other forward looking information 
the forward looking statements included in management s discussion and analysis are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made using information currently available to us  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events  these statements involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially and significantly from the results projected and discussed in the forward looking statements 
we caution you that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  the risk factors set forth herein 
risk factors we have a limited operating history we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects  having only commenced our initial business operations in april our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for internet broadcasting  services and advertising 
these risks include our ability to provide compelling and unique content to internet users  successfully market and sell our services  and effectively develop new and maintain existing relationships with advertisers  content providers  business customers and advertising agencies and other persons with which do business 
as we have such a limited history of operations  investors will be unable to assess our future operating performance or our future financial results or condition by comparing these criteria against their past or present equivalents 
we have extremely limited cash flow our business requires substantial capital to continue operations 
at the present time  we have not generated material revenues from operations 
to date  our cash flow has primarily come from intermittent sales of our securities and from non interest bearing loans from an affiliated person 
we also have minimal cash on hand 
we can give no assurance our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations at present levels  if at all 
we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future we have only recently recognized material revenues from services or advertising and we have experienced net losses since inception 
we expect to incur significant losses on both a quarterly and an annual basis for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability 
we will need significant additional financing to continue operations we will require substantial additional financing in order to be able to continue operations beyond the second quarter of we have no current definitive arrangements with respect to additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we may incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will result in substantial pro rata dilution to our present stockholders 
our inability to obtain additional financing will materially adversely affect us  including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail operations or to cease operations altogether 
technological stock in general have recently experienced significant downturns on the financial markets  and the trend is expected to continue indefinitely 
negative investor sentiment for technology stocks will adversely affect our ability to secure additional financing 
low price and trading volume in our stock may result in delisting of trading on the american stock exchange the price and volume at which our stock has recently traded on the american stock exchange does not meet its criteria for continued listing 
although the amex has not officially communicated any intention to us to delist our stock  if our stock were to be delisted  it would materially affect the ability of an investor to dispose of their shares of our stock  and further reduce the liquidity of their investment 
we will be unable to attract viewers to our networks and their channels if the public rejects streaming technology our success will depend upon market acceptance of streaming technology as an alternative to broadcast television 
without streaming technology  viewers would not be able to initiate playback of our programming until such programming is downloaded in its entirety  resulting in significant waiting times 
the acceptance of streaming technology will depend upon a number of factors  including market acceptance of streaming players such as microsoft s windows media player tm  real networks real player tm  and mediumcom player  technological improvements to the internet infrastructure to allow for improved video and audio quality and a reduction in internet usage congestion 
in addition  internet congestion may interrupt audio and video streams  resulting in user dissatisfaction 
our prospects will be adversely affected if streaming media technology fails to achieve or maintain broad acceptance 
we are dependent on providers of streaming media products we currently license software products that enable the broadcast of streaming media from such companies and others 
we may need to acquire additional licenses to meet our future needs 
users are currently able to download electronically copies of microsoft s windows media player tm  real network s real player tm  and our mediumcom software free of charge 
if providers of streaming media products substantially increase license fees charged to us for the use of their products or refuse to license such products to us  our ability to provide streaming audio and video will be adversely affected 
we are dependent on providers of broadband and high speed internet access we rely on providers of broadband and high speed internet access to facilitate the viewing of our sls channels 
because our mediumcom player  which is the software used to play the sls channels  can only play sls channels using high speed internet access  without such access viewers would not be able to download our sls programming 
if providers of broadband and high speed internet access do not sustain existing operations  or fail to maintain current access speeds  our ability to provide streaming video will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights we regard our copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  patents  and similar intellectual property as significant to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with our employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have applied for federal trademark protection for our networks and other channels and brands and intend to apply for federal trademark protection for other marks and names used in our business 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we are unable to assure investors as to the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights or those of other companies within the industry 
we are also unable to assure investors that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate 
furthermore  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
government regulation of the internet could harm our business there are few laws or regulations directly applicable to the internet 
for example  the digital millennium copyright act  enacted into law in  protects certain qualifying online service providers from copyright infringement liability  the internet tax freedom act  also enacted in  placed a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on internet access and commerce  and under the communications decency act  an internet service provider will not be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 
the appeal of the internet makes it likely  however  that state  national or international laws may be implemented in the future covering such issues as user privacy  defamatory speech  copyright infringement  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
any new law or regulation may have the effect of limiting the use of the internet and its growth as a new medium to communicate could harm our business 
we currently do not collect sales or other taxes with respect to the sale of services or products in states and countries where we believe we are not required to do so 
one or more states or countries have sought to impose sales or other tax obligations on companies that engage in online commerce within their jurisdictions 
a successful assertion by one or more states or countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on products and services  or remit payment of sales or other taxes for prior periods  could adversely affect our business 
the child online protection act of imposes criminal penalties and civil liability on anyone engaged in the business of selling or transferring material that is harmful to minors  by means of the internet  without restricting access to this type of material by underage persons 
numerous states have adopted or are currently considering similar types of legislation 
the imposition upon us of potential liability for broadcasting content that is harmful to minors could require us to implement measures to reduce exposure to liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources  or to discontinue various content offerings 
further  the costs of defending against any claims and potential adverse outcomes of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on certain third party providers our future success depends upon our ability to aggregate and deliver compelling content over the internet 
we rely exclusively on third party content providers  such as television stations and networks  businesses and other organizations  film producers and distributors  and record labels for compelling and entertaining content 
our ability to maintain and build relationships with content providers is critical to our success 
although many of our agreements with third party content providers are for initial terms of more than one year  such agreements may not be renewed or may be terminated prior to the expiration of their terms if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations 
our inability to secure licenses from content providers or the termination of a significant number of content provider agreements would decrease the availability of content that we can offer users 
such inability or termination may result in decreased traffic on our websites and  as a result  decreased advertising revenue  which could adversely affect our business 
we also rely on certain technologies we license from third parties 
there can be no assurance these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of such technology could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could harm our business 
however  other than our trademarks and service marks  we do not believe that the loss of any particular one of our intellectual property rights would materially harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have purchased no options and entered into no swaps 
we have no bank borrowing facility that could subject us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
