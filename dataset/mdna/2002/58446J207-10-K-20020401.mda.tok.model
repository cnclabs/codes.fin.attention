item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction beginning in july  we conducted a review of our operations  including product offerings  marketing methods and pricing 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement a series of actions and decisions designed to improve gross profit margin  refine our marketing efforts and reduce general and administrative costs 
specifically  we i reduced the number of items offered for sale at both its radio spirits and audio book club subsidiaries  ii moved fulfillment of our old time radio products to a third party fulfillment provider  iii limited our investment and marketing efforts in downloadable audio due to lack of customer acceptance at this time  and the limited number and high price point of digital audio download players currently produced and iv refined our marketing of old time radio products and our marketing efforts to existing audio book club members 
in connection with the movement of the fulfillment of old time radio products to a third party provider  in the first quarter of  we closed our old time radio operations in schaumburg  illinois and now run all of our operations  except for fulfillment  from our corporate headquarters located in cedar knolls  new jersey 
in the third quarter of  as a result of the actions and decisions made after our aforementioned review of our operations  we recorded million of write downs and strategic charges 
in addition to these strategic charges  we recorded a charge of million to write off the entire carrying amount of our cost method investment in i jam 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed long lived assets and certain related identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fasb due to a change in facts and circumstances 
we determined that the revised estimates of cash flows from certain of our acquired operations would no longer be sufficient to recover the carrying value of goodwill associated with these businesses 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the goodwill associated with these businesses was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was measured as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its fair value  which was based upon discounted cash flows 
as a result of the series of strategic initiatives  described above  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we have determined  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly  in we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
as a result of the recording of the goodwill write off  the strategic charges and the income tax benefit  as well as fluctuations in operating results depending on the timing  magnitude and success of audio book club new member advertising campaigns  comparisons of our historical operating results from year to year may not be meaningful 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  the carrying value and net realizable value of inventories  the recoverability of advances to publishers and other rightsholders  the future revenue associated with deferred advertising and promotion costs  investments  fixed assets  the valuation allowance provided to reduce our deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o we record reductions to our revenue for future returns and record an estimate of future bad debts arising from current sales 
these allowances are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
if members and customers return products to us in the future at higher rates than in the past or than we currently anticipate  our net sales would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected 
also  if the financial condition of our customers  including both individual consumers or retail chains  were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payment to us  additional allowances would be required 
o we are required to capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position reporting on advertising costs and amortize these costs over the period of probable future benefits 
in order to determine the amount of advertising to be capitalized and the manner and period over which the advertising should be amortized  we prepare estimates of probable future revenues arising from the direct response advertising in excess of future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues 
if future revenue does not meet our estimates or if members buying patterns were to shift  adjustments to the amount and manner of amortization would be required 
actual amounts incurred for advertising and promotion  net of settlements with certain vendors principally for unprofitable internet marketing campaigns  for the year ended december  were million 
the difference between the amount expended of million for the year ended december  and the amount recorded as advertising and promotion expense  of million  for the year ended december  is due to amortization of previously capitalized direct response advertising 
o the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary timing differences become deductible 
as a result of a series of strategic initiatives  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  management has determined  based on the company s improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
should we determine we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
o goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
at december   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  which is subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
we do not believe the transitional impairment provisions of this statement will have any impact on our financial statements overview we are a leading seller of spoken audio and nostalgia products  including audiobooks and old time radio shows  through direct response  retail and internet channels

our marketing programs have consisted primarily of direct mail  media advertising and marketing on the internet 
we capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position reporting on advertising costs and amortize these costs over the period of future benefit  based on our historical experience 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  historical operating data as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales cost of sales write downs advertising and promotion advertising and promotion write downs general and administrative expense asset write downs and strategic charges depreciation and amortization expense non cash write down of goodwill interest income expense  net income tax benefit extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in gross sales is primarily attributable to more focused marketing at audio book club to concentrate on more profitable new members and non recurring i jam marketing revenue we recorded in in addition  in the beginning of  we revised the logic used in determining customer product shipments  which resulted in lower gross sales but also lower return rates 
returns  discounts and allowances declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  returns  discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross sales were in as compared to of gross sales for the prior comparable period due to aforementioned revisions in the logic used in determining customer shipments 
principally as a result of lower gross sales  partially offset by lower return rates  net sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was million  of which million represented a charge for the write down of inventory in the third quarter of excluding the write down  cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  is principally due to revisions in the merchandising of our products  including increases in our selling prices and selection of products  which contribute greater gross profit 
as a result  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  excluding the write down  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  was million of which  million represented write downs to deferred member acquisition costs as described below 
excluding the write downs  advertising and promotion expenses increased million or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  actual amounts incurred for advertising and promotion  net of settlements with certain vendors principally for unprofitable internet marketing campaigns  for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  from the amount incurred in the year ended december  of million 
the difference between the amount expended and the amount recorded as expense is due to amortization of previously capitalized direct response advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior comparable period 
general and administrative expense decreases are principally attributable to decreases in bad debt expenses commensurate with the reduction in net sales  payroll and related costs due to previously announced staff reductions  office expenses  telephone costs related to a reduction in service calls  travel costs  public relations costs and consulting services principally relating to internet maintenance and development 
we also benefited from settlements with certain vendors in as a result of the actions and decisions made after our aforementioned review of our operations  we recorded million of strategic charges in these charges include the following o million of inventory written down to net realizable value due to a reduction in the number of stock keeping units sku s  o million of write downs to deferred member acquisition costs at audio book club related to new member acquisition campaigns that have been determined to be no longer profitable and recoverable through future operations based upon historical performance and future projections  o million of write downs to royalty advances paid to audiobook publishers and other license holders primarily associated with inventory titles that will no longer be carried and sold to members  o million of write downs to deferred member acquisition costs at radio spirits related to old time radio new customer acquisition campaigns that have been determined to be no longer profitable and recoverable through future operations based upon historical performance and future projections  o a write down of million of customer lists acquired in the columbia house audiobook club purchase due to the inability to recover this asset through future operations  o million of fixed assets of the old time radio operations written down to net realizable value due to the closing of the schaumburg  illinois facility  o million of write downs of royalty advances paid for downloadable licensing rights that are no longer recoverable due to the strategic decisions made  o million of write downs of prepaid assets  o million of write offs to receivables that are deemed uncollectible  o million of net write offs of capitalized website development costs related to downloadable audio all of which are no longer recoverable due to the strategic changes in the business  and o million accrued for lease termination costs in connection with the closing of the schaumburg  illinois facility 
of these charges  million related to inventory write downs has been recorded to costs of sales strategic charges  million has been recorded to advertising and promotion write downs and the remaining million has been recorded to asset write downs and strategic charges 
in addition to these strategic charges  we have recorded a charge of million to write off the entire carrying amount of our cost method investment in i jam 
this charge has been recorded to asset write downs and strategic charges 
we have determined that an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment has occurred  triggered by a strategic change in the direction of the investee as a result of continued losses and operating deficiencies  along with projected future losses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to the write down of goodwill taken in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed long lived assets and certain related identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fasb due to a change in facts and circumstances 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic decision to reduce spending on marketing to customers acquired in the acquisitions of the columbia house audiobook club  doubleday direct s audiobooks direct and adventures in cassettes in order to focus its resources on more profitable revenue sources 
in addition  we sold the remaining inventory acquired in its acquisition of adventures in cassettes and do not expect to derive any future revenues associated with this business 
consequently  we determined that the revised estimates of cash flows from such operations would no longer be sufficient to recover the carrying value of goodwill associated with these businesses 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the goodwill associated with these businesses was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was measured as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its fair value  which was based upon discounted cash flows 
net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense is due to a lower average outstanding principal balance on our debt  as well as lower interest rates on the portion of our debt  which has adjustable interest rates 
net loss before income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss before income taxes and an extraordinary item in of million for the year ended december  as a result of the series of strategic initiatives described above  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we have determined  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
in april  we repaid million of our bank debt out of the net proceeds from our follow on primary offering 
accordingly  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million relating to the write off of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with such debt 
due  in part  to the reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets offset by the strategic charges enumerated above  we had a net loss of million  or per share of common stock for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million or per share of common stock for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in gross sales was primarily attributable to a slowdown in the aggressive marketing at both audio book club and radio spirits 
in addition  we revised the logic used in determining customer product shipments  which resulted in lower gross sales but also lower return rates 
we also instituted a policy of offering higher discounts  which resulted in lower dollar sales 
this policy was subsequently eliminated 
returns  discounts and allowances declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  returns  discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross sales were in as compared to of gross sales for the prior comparable period 
the decrease in returns is due to aforementioned revisions in the logic used in determining customer shipments  as well as lower gross sales 
principally as a result of lower gross sales  partially offset by lower return rates  net sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was as compared to in the prior comparable period 
in  we offered an everyday low pricing discount structure to audio book club members via both the catalog and at audiobookclub 
com 
beginning in january  we eliminated this discount structure 
advertising and promotion expenses increased million or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  actual amounts expended for advertising and promotion in the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from the amount expended in the year ended december  of million 
the difference between the amount expended and the amount recorded as expense is due to the capitalization of direct response advertising 
beginning in january  the company was required to capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position reporting on advertising costs and amortize these costs over the period of future benefit 
since was the first year we capitalized new member acquisitions costs  we capitalized a very large portion of direct response advertising expenditures 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior comparable period 
general and administrative expense increases are principally attributable to increased personnel and related costs including costs of bringing rsi fulfillment in house  investor and public relation expenses and consulting expenses  including outside internet development and maintenance expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is principally due to amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of doubleday direct s audiobooks direct 
net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december  the company has reduced its debt by million since december  loss before extraordinary item for the year ended december  was million or per share as compared to a net loss of million or 
per share for the year ended december  in april  we repaid million of our bank debt out of the net proceeds from our follow on primary offering 
accordingly  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million relating to the write off of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with such debt 
primarily due to the write off of goodwill of million  net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share of common stock as compared to a net loss of million or 
per share of common stock for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our cash requirements through sales of our equity and debt securities and borrowings from financial institutions and our principal shareholders 
we have implemented a series of initiatives to increase cash flow 
while these initiatives have successfully reduced cash used in operations in  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing to repay debt  fund the expansion of operations  acquisitions  working capital or other related uses 
the asset write downs and strategic charges taken in are not expected to impact future cash flows except for million of accrued lease termination costs in connection with the closing of the schaumburg  illinois facility  assuming the facility is not sub leased 
we are required under our the loan agreement for our bank debt to make payments on our debt  in  as follows o a payment of  was made in march o payments of  are due may and june  o monthly payments of  are due at the end of each month beginning in july and ending december  we anticipate making the payments from cash flow generated from operations 
we also have notes to huntingdon corporation huntingdon  a company wholly owned by our chairman  norton herrick of million and  these notes mature on january  and april   respectively 
for the year ended december   our cash decreased by million  as we used net cash of million and million for operating and investing activities  respectively  and had cash provided by financing activities of million 
net cash used in operations principally consisted of the net loss of million  including a million reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  an increase in prepaid expenses of and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash used in operations was partially offset by asset write downs and strategic charges of million  depreciation and amortization expenses included in net loss of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in royalty advances of million and a net decrease in deferred member acquisition costs of million 
the increase in prepaid expenses is principally the result of advertising costs incurred in december for an audio book club direct mail campaign  which mailed in january the decrease in accounts payable is principally due to payments made to vendors as our cash flow improved and settlement agreements we entered into with certain vendors 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to lower net sales and to the collection of retail receivables  net of returns  at our old time radio business 
the decrease in inventories is principally due to a reduction in the number of titles offered for sale 
the decrease in deferred member acquisition cost is principally due to settlements with direct response vendors  principally on the internet  and reductions in the size of our direct response advertising campaigns resulting in better response rates 
cash used in investing activities was for the acquisition of fixed assets  principally for kiosks to be placed at certain retail stores and computer equipment  and the acquisition of certain rights relating to our video products 
on may   we issued a million secured senior convertible note to huntingdon corporation huntingdon  a company wholly owned by our chairman  norton herrick 
in addition  we issued a million secured senior subordinated convertible note to huntingdon for advances previously received including an advance of million received in february for a further description of these transactions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k 
on may   we modified a million senior subordinated convertible note held by norton herrick 
we also modified a million senior subordinated convertible note held by evan herrick  norton herrick s son 
for a further description of these transactions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k

at december   the amount we may borrow under the revolving loan agreement was million  the amount outstanding under the revolving loan agreement 
in march  we made an additional million loan payment  as of march  the amount we may borrow under the revolving loan agreement was million  which was the amount outstanding under the revolving loan agreement 
on january   evan herrick  a principal shareholder of the registrant  exchanged million principal amount of a million principal amount convertible note of mediabay  inc in exchange for  shares of series a preferred stock of mediabay  having a liquidation preference of million 
the preferred share dividend rate of per share is the same as the interest rate of the note  and is payable in additional preferred shares  shares of common stock of mediabay or cash  at the holder s option  provided that if the holder elects to receive payment in cash  the payment will accrue until mediabay is permitted to make the payment under its existing credit facility 
on february   huntingdon purchased a million principal amount convertible senior promissory note due june  the note is convertible into shares of common stock at the rate of of principal and or interest per share 
this note was issued in consideration of a million loan made to the company by huntingdon 
on april   huntingdon extended the maturity date of the million secured senior convertible note to january  and ii the million secured senior subordinated convertible note to april  for no additonal consideration 
as partial consideration for the loan and pursuant to an agreement dated april   the company granted to huntingdon warrants to purchase  of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable until may  recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet one of two criteria 
the statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
existing goodwill continued to be amortized through the remainder of fiscal at which time amortization ceased  and we are currently performing a transitional goodwill impairment test 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal periods beginning january  at december   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  which is subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
we do not believe the transitional impairment provisions of this statement will have any impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas at the beginning of our fiscal year we have not determined the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
this statement requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
this statement also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of this statement are required to be adopted by the company at the beginning of its fiscal year we have not determined the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
net operating losses our net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in under section of the internal revenue code of  utilization of prior net operating losses is limited after an ownership change  as defined in section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the additional equity financing we obtained in may result in an ownership change and  thus  may limit our use of our prior net operating losses 
in the event we achieve profitable operations  any significant limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would have the effect of increasing our tax liability and reducing net income and available cash reserves 
we are unable to determine the availability of net operating losses since this availability is dependent upon profitable operations  which we have not achieved in prior periods 
we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net operating loss carryforwards
