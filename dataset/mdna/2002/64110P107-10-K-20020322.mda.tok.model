on december  the acquisition date  the company acquired  for aggregate consideration of million  all of the outstanding stock of datachannel  inc  a washington corporation datachannel 
on the acquisition date  datachannel  a leading provider of enterprise portal solutions  became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the acquisition 
the aggregate consideration included approximately million in cash including assumed debt of million  million of acquisition costs paid subsequent to the acquisition date and  shares of the company s common stock valued at approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assumed tangible net liabilities of approximately million was allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development  and goodwill in the amounts of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
results of operations of datachannel from the acquisition date are included in the company s consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates netegrity s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenues are primarily generated from the sale of perpetual licenses to its proprietary siteminder  dms and nis products and services 
the company generates its services revenue from consulting and training services performed for customers and from maintenance and support 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we license our software products on a perpetual basis 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company does not offer a right of return on its products 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  product  undelivered maintenance and support  and training and consulting  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
in addition  we assess whether collection is probable or not based on the credit worthiness of the customer 
initial credit worthiness is assessed through dun bradstreet or similar credit rating agencies 
credit worthiness for follow on transactions is assessed through a review of the transaction history with the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
revenues for maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangibles purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
in our recording of the acquisition of datachannel on december   values were assigned to in process research and development iprd and intangible assets for acquired technology and goodwill based on management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenues and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
the allocation of purchase price to iprd of million represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the acquisition date  the development of these projects had not reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the statement of operations for the year ended december  at the acquisition date  datachannel was conducting testing activities associated with the development of next generation technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for enterprise information portal solutions 
the technologies under development were approximately complete based on project duration and costs 
datachannel had spent approximately million on the iprd projects and expected to spend another million to complete these specific research and development activities 
iprd was identified and valued through extensive interviews  analysis of data concerning developmental products  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  and  if applicable  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the iprd 
the projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of determined after consideration of various factors including the company s cost of capital and the risk associated with the various technologies 
the acquired existing technology  which is comprised of products that are already technologically feasible  relates primarily to the technology incorporated in earlier versions of the datachannel server product 
the company is amortizing the acquired existing technology of approximately million on a straight line basis over an estimated remaining useful life of three years 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the asset will generate revenue 
intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents statement of operations data as percentages of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  statement of operations data revenues software licenses services other total revenues cost of revenues cost of software licenses cost of services cost of other total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses acquired in process research and development non recurring expenses loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss siteminder and dms software revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  siteminder and dms services revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  other revenues consisting primarily of licensing the rights to use software products developed by checkpoint software technologies  ltd accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  nis revenues were not significant for the year ended december  we currently sell our siteminder  dms and nis products through a combination of our direct sales force  worldwide resellers  referral partners and licensees 
international sales amounted to approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues derived outside of north america will increase 
increasing our international sales may subject us to risks  many of which are outside our control  including economic uncertainties  currency fluctuations  political instability and uncertain cultural and regulatory environments 
our cost of revenues includes  among other things  royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  amortization of acquired software  product fulfillment costs  and salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education and technical support services organizations  and the associated cost of training facilities 
our operating expenses are classified into two general categories selling  general and administrative and research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for selling  administrative and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  legal and accounting services  public relations  marketing materials  trade shows and certain facilities related expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and outside contractor costs to support product development 
historically we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our research and development  sales  marketing and professional services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
historically  the company has incurred substantial losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in future periods as we increase sales and marketing operations  expand distribution channels  increase research and development  broaden professional services  expand facilities and support  and improve operational and financial systems 
accordingly  in order to maintain and enhance our profitability  it will be necessary to achieve continued growth in revenues 
although we have experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods  that growth has been from a relatively small customer base  and there can be no assurance that those growth rates are sustainable 
therefore  historical growth rates are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our revenues or achieve sustained profitability 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  software license revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase is due to the continued increase in market awareness and the acceptance of the siteminder product  the expansion of our sales organization and the leveraging of our strategic partner relationships 
for the year ended december   the company added new siteminder software customers 
nis revenues were not significant for the year ended december  service revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase is attributable to maintenance and services arrangements for a growing customer base coupled with increasing demand to provide installation and integration services for our new customers

total cost of revenues increased by approximately million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  cost of software licenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to favorable revisions of royalty contracts with third party licensors slightly offset by increases in amortization on acquired software 
cost of services increased by approximately million or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increases in payroll and related personnel expenses for our consulting and training organizations as a result of increased siteminder service revenues

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase is attributable to several factors 
approximately million including million related to the datachannel acquisition  or  of this increase relates to increased payroll and related costs including the addition of approximately employees in the sales and marketing organization of the company during and the full year effect of approximately employees hired during the second half of fiscal year and million  or  in costs for additional administrative support personnel

the remaining increase relates to increased general expenses in support of the additional head count added to research and development for the year ended december  we expect to continue to increase the amount spent on research and development in the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and enhance our product line to address the evolving needs of customers deploying large scale and transaction based e business applications 
acquired in process research and development 
in  we recorded non recurring charges of million or of total revenue for acquired in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of datachannel 
this amount was expensed on the date of acquisition because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future will not result in substantial charges for acquired in process research and development 
such charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results

other income 
other income decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this decrease was mainly attributable to declines in interest rates for cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities coupled with larger foreign currency translation losses during the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared with a provision of  for the year ended december  this increase relates to federal alternative minimum taxes  state taxes and foreign taxes 
the provision for the year ended december  differs from the expected tax rates due to nondeductible acquired in process research and development expenses offset by a reduction in the company s valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  against which a full valuation allowance has been provided  available for federal and state purposes to reduce future taxable income expiring on various dates through of the million of net operating loss carryforwards  million is attributable to tax deductions relating to stock options and million is related to the acquisition of datachannel 
the benefit of the stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
the benefit of the acquired net operating loss carryforward will reduce goodwill when realized 
under the tax reform act of  the utilization of a corporation s net operating loss carryforward is limited following a greater than change in ownership over a three year period 
as a result of the datachannel acquisition million of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency in the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its revenues outside of the united states 
international sales are typically denominated in us dollars 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
translation gains and losses amounting to a loss of approximately  as of december  are deferred and accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions  amounting to a loss of approximately  during the year ended december   are included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
a change in the valuation of the functional currencies relative to the us dollar as of december  and would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the years then ended 
interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments including floating rate bonds  municipal bonds  asset backed securities and money market instruments in accordance with an investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
we estimate that if the average yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of the year and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the same basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the investment portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income and future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio
