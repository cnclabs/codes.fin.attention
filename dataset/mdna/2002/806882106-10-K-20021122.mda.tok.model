item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost methods 
the production and accounting process utilized by the company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
the company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates  the company not only runs periodic tests  but also performs physical inventories 
physical inventories can normally detect significant variations in volume  but because of variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer  and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally upon shipment 
title for both recycled metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment 
substantially all of the company s ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  minimizing credit risk 
however  domestic ferrous recycled metal sales  non ferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore no provisions are made when the sale is recognized 
bad debt reserves the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts  notes and advances receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where management is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we maintain a reserve that considers the total receivables outstanding  historical collection rates and economic trends 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
these consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonable established  and no other amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate 
in a number of cases  it is possible the company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance 
in these situations  recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
results of operations the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the western united states 
for example  increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal however  during fiscal and  the asian financial crisis severely curtailed demand and decreased prices  causing a negative impact on the results of the metal recycling business 
during fiscal  the company saw demand for recycled metal rise  but unusually large supplies of recycled ferrous metal became available in certain of the countries that were part of the former soviet union  thereby holding prices down 
in addition  domestic demand for finished steel products was strong  but lower cost imports  primarily from asia  caused average prices to generally decline 
in fiscal  the demand for recycled metals declined in the united states as domestic steel production declined  however  demand in asia  particularly in china  remained firm 
selling prices also continued to be adversely affected by supplies coming out of the former soviet union 
demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing united states economy and competition from lower cost imports 
during the first six months of fiscal  recycled metals prices approached record lows due primarily to weak domestic demand 
however  in the second half of the fiscal year  prices rose due to improved demand from domestic steel producers 
in addition  exports of recycled metal from the former soviet union were restrained by higher export taxes and selected export bans 
however  domestic demand for finished steel remained sluggish in the western united states throughout fiscal united states tariffs on selected steel products announced in march had little effect on most of the products produced by the steel manufacturing business  namely rebar and merchant bar 
the result was a record low average net selling price for the steel manufacturing business 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business  and the breakdown of income from operations between the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business  joint ventures  corporate and eliminations 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total sales to the steel manufacturing business sales to unaffiliated customers steel manufacturing business total income loss from operations year ended august  in millions metals recycling business steel manufacturing business jvs in the metals recycling business jv suppliers of metals corporate expense intercompany eliminations impairment and other nonrecurring charges income from operations ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business are made at a negotiated rate per ton that is intended to approximate market 
includes year end lifo adjustments that reduced income from operations by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and increased income from operations by million in fiscal this adjustment was partially offset in fiscal by a million gain from a nonrecurring sale of jv property 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
impairment and other nonrecurring charges related to the metals recycling business 
the amount is shown separately to assist in understanding the business financial results 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for the metals recycling business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year 
revenues for the steel manufacturing business were slightly lower primarily due to lower average net selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices 
ferrous volumes increased  tons and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased to per ton 
diminished supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former soviet union and growing worldwide demand drove the volume and price increases 
asia  especially china and korea  continues to be the primary destination of export sales 
in fiscal  the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons  an increase of  tons compared with fiscal because of the continued soft united states economy  domestic third party ferrous tonnage decreased  ton to  tons 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business decreased to  tons due to production curtailments in this business 
nonferrous revenues decreased million to million due to a corresponding reduction in sales volume 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  a decline of per pound from fiscal the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues of million in fiscal  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
the volume of finished steel products sold increased  but the average net selling price per ton decreased compared with fiscal sales of finished steel products were up to  tons while the average net selling price per ton decreased per ton to per ton  a record low 
the decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower average net selling prices for all major product lines which were partially offset by the increase in sales volumes 
the decrease in the average sales price per ton is primarily due to the sluggish united states economy and weak end user demand  continuing competition from lower cost steel imports and a shift in product mix from merchant bar to wire rod 
the increase in sales volume was due to a greater sales volume of wire rod  which was partially offset by a decline in the sales volume of merchant bar 
the higher wire rod volume was due to additional demand by a major customer 
tariffs on selected imported steel products enacted in march and april by the international trade commission itc under section of the trade act did not produced any significant price benefits 
in october  the itc announced duty margins of up to and subsidy rates of up to against foreign producers of wire rod products from eight foreign countries 
it is anticipated that these duties  if they remain in effect  will favorably impact the steel manufacturing business wire rod prices 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods increased million to million and was percent of revenues compared with in fiscal the increase to was primarily due to eroded margins for the steel manufacturing business 
gross profit decreased million to million 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from for fiscal to during fiscal  contributing to a million increase in gross profit 
this increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume  partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers for ferrous recycled metals  resulting in a per ton increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the company paid for unprocessed metal 
lower shipping costs per ton partially offset the purchase price increases 
competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million to million and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to over in fiscal the increase was due to higher fixed costs being spread over fewer production tons as mill curtailments that began in august continued throughout fiscal melt shop production fell and rolling mill production fell compared with fiscal also  contributing to the increase was a rise in energy costs 
energy cost increased due to the western energy shortage which increased contracted power rates 
average cost of sales per ton increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increased cost of sales per ton  combined with the per ton reduction in average net selling price  resulted in a decrease in gross profit of million in fiscal compared with fiscal impairment and other nonrecurring charges 
the company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of million in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million for the early termination of a fixed price alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective 
the alaska barge contract charge included a million write off of a note receivable and a million payment to terminate the contract 
also  an impairment charge of million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car crushing business and an impairment charge of million was recorded for the closure of an under performing yard in reno  nevada 
the company now sublets the reno facility and leases the equipment to a third party that sells its recycled metal output to the company 
nonrecurring charges of million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company 
the company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were to per ton lower than the all in contracted rates 
shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totalled approximately million 
additionally  a loss of million was recorded for the sale of a non strategic steel forging business 
a number of the charges were a direct result of the company s implementation of economic value added eva which is a tool used to measure financial performance and acceptable returns on investment as well as compensate management on the change in eva performance 
since implementing eva  the company has re analyzed the business performance and related outlook for many of its assets 
the result of these reviews  using the eva tool  led to many operational and management changes in the company s business 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strong demand from asia  especially china and korea 
these joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to increased sales volume  higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company in fiscal the use of eva has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the jv lifo inventory adjustment compared with a benefit of million in fiscal operating income in fiscal also benefited by million representing the company s share of a nonrecurring gain on sale of jv property 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased sales by the company s self service auto dismantling joint venture 
increased sales prices  more efficient operations  and lower interest costs drove the revenue growth and income improvements 
selling and commission expenses 
these expenses increased million compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales 
general and administrative expenses 
compared with fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to a million increase in wages as a result of annual merit increases and bonus accruals related to the company s eva performance and a million in increased insurance expense due to adverse insurance market conditions since september  interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased million compared with fiscal due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the company s borrowings averaged million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in average borrowings reflects improved cash flow as a result of substantial decreases in inventory during fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal other income 
other income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates charged on variable interest rate advances and notes to joint venture businesses 
in addition  this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non qualified pension payments 
during fiscal and  the company recognized losses from the trust fund assets in the amount of million and million  respectively 
income tax provision 
as part of the acquisition of proler international corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
prior to fiscal  federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the nols 
accordingly  the company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the nols because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits 
in fiscal  a change in federal tax law allowed the company to use the nols to offset taxable income from all sources  subject to a limit of million per year 
during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from the use of million of nols  which was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was as compared to the statutory rate of 
in fiscal  it was determined that the company qualified for million of enterprise zone tax credits in the state of california 
these credits can be used to offset california state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a california franchise income tax liability 
any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely 
the combination of nols and enterprise zone tax credits made the company s effective tax rate for fiscal as compared with a statutory rate of 
as noted above  federal income tax law limits the company s use of nols to million per year 
unused nols may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years  though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years through  if not used by then 
subject to the annual limit  there remains at august  million of proler nols that may be used in future years before they expire 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business were lower as consolidated revenues decreased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  a decrease of million 
ferrous revenues decreased million to million primarily as a result of lower average net selling prices 
ferrous volumes decreased  tons and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased per ton to per ton 
however  prices firmed in the fourth quarter of fiscal as the volume of lower cost ferrous recycled metal from the countries of the former soviet union diminished 
the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons  an increase of  tons in fiscal compared with fiscal demand from asia  particularly china  has remained strong and pushed ferrous export tons higher in fiscal compared with fiscal because of the softening united states economy domestic third party ferrous tonnage decreased  ton 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to an increase in melt shop production at the company s steel mini mill 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher volumes 
improvements in the processes used to extract metal from the automobile shredding process and a temporary backlog of unprocessed shredder residue provided higher volumes of nonferrous metals  increasing sales volume by million pounds in fiscal compared with fiscal the average nonferrous selling price decreased per pound due to slowing demand caused primarily by the slowdown in the united states economy 
the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues of million in fiscal  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
sales of finished steel products declined to  tons while the average net selling price per ton increased per ton to per ton 
the decrease in sales volumes came from all major product lines with the exception of reinforcing bar  for which sales volume approximated prior year levels 
the slight increase in the average sales price per ton is primarily due to the change in product mix 
during fiscal  the company focused on selling those products  such as reinforcing bar  which have higher margins 
the slowing united states economy  as well as competition from lower cost steel imports  continues to impact sales volumes and prices 
on june   president bush asked the united states international trade commission to investigate the effects of steel imports on the domestic steel industry under section of the trade act 
the commission has determined that some steel imports were a threat to domestic steel producers  and the president imposed safeguard restrictions on steel imports to aid the steel industry 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold decreased million to million and was of revenues  consistent with fiscal however  gross profit decreased million to million 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business decreased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton decreased as demand for processed metal declined  allowing the company to lower the price paid for unprocessed metal 
gross profit decreased million compared with the prior fiscal year as the decline in the cost of unprocessed ferrous metal was more than offset by a decrease in the average net selling price per ton for ferrous recycled metal 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business decreased million reflecting the lower sales volume for fiscal compared with fiscal cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to decreased production volume  that spread fixed costs over fewer tons  and a higher volume of sales to california  which have higher freight and distribution costs than sales in the pacific northwest 
this increased cost of sales per ton resulted in a decrease in gross profit of million in fiscal compared with fiscal income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower average ferrous selling prices partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to competition from the countries of the former soviet union as well as lower demand from domestic steel mills 
the lower ferrous revenues were partially offset by higher nonferrous revenues 
this increase was due to greater nonferrous metal recovery from higher ferrous volumes processed and improved processes for the extraction of nonferrous metals 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to increased sales volume  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company 
this led to improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
also  the hugo neu joint ventures were able to lower buying prices as selling prices declined 
the company also benefited by million to reflect the company s share of lifo inventory adjustments 
in comparison  the results for fiscal were adversely affected by a million lifo inventory adjustment 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased sales by the company s self service auto dismantling joint venture 
increased sales prices and lower interest costs drove the improvements 
selling and commission expenses 
compared with fiscal  there was a decrease of million 
this was primarily due to lower commission expense for the metals recycling business due to a decrease in ferrous recycled metals export sales 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the company averaged borrowings of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in average borrowings reflects a substantial decrease in borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal due primarily to inventory reductions then and during the first half of fiscal  as well as a million improvement in cash flow from the company s joint ventures 
this lower borrowing level continued through fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets 
fiscal gain loss on sale of assets improved by million 
the increase is mainly attributable to the fact that last year s amount included a loss of million on the sale of a vessel used to export recycled metal 
other income 
other income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a million change in gains and losses recognized on trust fund assets of a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain company executives 
other income was also adversely impacted by lower average interest rates on advances and notes to joint venture partners  resulting in a decrease of million 
income tax provision 
as part of the acquisition of proler international  corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
prior to fiscal  federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the nols 
accordingly  the company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the nols because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits 
in fiscal  federal tax law was amended  which allowed the company to utilize the nols to offset substantially all of its taxable income 
as a result  in fiscal  the company utilized million of nols in determining its effective tax rate  which included a catch up of million of nols 
this change in tax law resulted in an effective tax of in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from the utilization of million of nols  and was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was only as compared to the statutory rate of 
as noted above  federal income tax law limits the company s use of nols to million per year 
unused nols may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years  though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years through  if not used by then 
subject to the annual limit  there remained at august  million of proler nols that may be used in future years before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated by operations was million  compared to million last year 
the increase in cash flow provided by operations was primarily the result of improved operating profits before nonrecurring items and lower year end inventories 
cash was also generated by million of net cash distributed from the company s joint ventures  million of which was attributable to barrowings under the new joint venture credit facility discussed below net of the increase in cash retained by the joint ventures 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
because of generally poor market conditions  coupled with larger capital investments in the mid to late s  the company has focused its capital investment on non discretionary capital and investments with shorter paybacks 
as part of its acquisitions of proler and mmi  the company assumed environmental liabilities that aggregated million as of august  the company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities 
the company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement of million that expires in june in the aggregate  the company had borrowings outstanding under this line of million as of august  the million is classified as a current liability as the credit agreement expires during fiscal management intends to replace the bank credit facility with a new agreement 
further  management believes it has the ability to refinance the facility based upon the company s financial position and from preliminary discussions with various banks that participate in its current facility 
as of august   the company had additional uncommitted lines of credit available of million 
the company s debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
in july  the company s metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation entered into a million revolving credit facility jv credit facility with a group of banks for working capital and general credit purposes 
prior to this time  the joint ventures working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the company and hugo neu corporation 
the jv credit facility expires in july  is secured by the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses and has a negative pledge on the remaining assets 
the company is not a guarantor of the jv credit facility 
the jv credit facility has a number of covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners 
as of august   the joint ventures were in compliance with such covenants 
borrowings under the jv credit facility totaled million at august  the company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments 
the following table summarizes these future obligations and commitments as of august  in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases      letters of credit   jv credit facility   total      this disclosure assumes that if the jv credit facility is not renewed or refinanced upon expiration  the company and hugo neu corporation would restore their previous arrangement under which each funded one half of the joint ventures cash needs 
pursuant to a stock repurchase program  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its stock when the market price of the company s stock is not reflective of management s opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock 
management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the company manage its targeted capital structure 
as of august   a total of million shares had been purchased under this program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its stock for a total of million 
the company believes that the current cash balance  internally generated funds  existing credit facilities and its anticipation of being able to refinance its credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements and future environmental obligations for the next year 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
factors that could affect future results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one can generally identify these forward looking statements because they contain expect  believe and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
examples of factors affecting schnitzer steel industries  inc s wholly owned operations and its joint ventures the company that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following cyclicality and general market considerations selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to volatile supply and demand conditions beyond the company s control  resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices 
while the company attempts to maintain margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices  the company s ability to do so is limited by competitive factors as well as the impact of lower prices on the volume of scrap available to the company 
moreover  increases in recycled metals prices can adversely affect the operating results of the company s steel manufacturing business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices 
the steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions 
future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the company 
the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income 
revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry  which is an important buyer of the company s finished steel products 
the timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather 
the company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year 
customer requirements  shipping schedules and other factors limit the company s control over the timing of these shipments 
variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes  as well as earnings  are based in part on the assumption that orders from customers for larger shipments are not cancelled or delayed 
competition the recycled metals industry is highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors  principally price 
the company has competition from both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals 
the company competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors for sales to foreign customers 
the domestic steel industry also is highly competitive 
steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor 
the company competes with several steel producers in the western united states for sales of its products 
in addition  in recent years  the company has experienced significant foreign competition  which is often subsidized by large government agencies 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future 
in march and april  the itc imposed tariffs on imported steel  under section of the trade act  to aid the domestic steel industry 
to date  those tariffs have not significantly benefited selling prices for finished steel products 
in october  the itc announced duty margins of up to and subsidy rate of up to against wire rod products from eight foreign countries 
the company cannot  however  predict the impact of these duty margins and subsidy rates on prices and operating results 
joint ventures the company has significant investments in joint venture companies 
the company does not manage the day to day activities of these businesses 
as a result  it does not have the same ability to control the operations and related financial results as it does with its wholly owned businesses 
these businesses are  however  affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned above 
therefore  it is difficult to predict the financial results of these businesses 
energy supply the company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities 
in particular  electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately of the cost of steel manufactured for the company s steel manufacturing business 
the steel manufacturing business purchases electric power under long term contracts from government sources which rely on the bonneville power administration bpa 
historically  these contracts have had favorable prices and are long term in nature 
the company has a five year contract that expires in september on october   the bpa increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the west coast and lower supplies 
this increase was in the form of a cost recovery adjustment clause crac added to bpa s contract with mcminnville 
the crac is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the west coast power shortage 
the crac  which bpa can adjust every six months  was at october   and then reduced to at april  and at october  however  it is not possible to predict future rate changes 
the steel manufacturing business also has long term contracts for natural gas 
in october  the company entered into a new contract set to expire on october  the latest contract negotiations resulted in rates that were higher then the previous agreement 
as this contract comes to an end  the company will attempt to negotiate a new long term contract  however  it is not possible to predict the terms of the contract 
the inability of the company to negotiate favorable terms of electricity  natural gas and other energy sources could adversely affect the performance of the company 
tax laws the company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of net operating loss carryforwards nols  state of california enterprise zone tax credits and foreign sales corporations or extraterritorial income exclusions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company cannot predict how future tax law changes might affect the company s effective tax rate 
shipping and handling both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner 
the cost to transport the products can be affected by circumstances over which the company has no control such as fuel prices  governmental regulations on transportation  and changes in market rates 
also  the products are handled  at times  by union workers and the company cannot predict when or if union labor relations could affect the cost or timeliness of shipments 
insurance the cost of the company s insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market 
though the company s loss record and relationship with its underwriters is good it cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments  principally long term debt 
sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair value from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to those market sensitive instruments of such changes 
the discount rates used for such present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at august   plus or minus 
a change in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  would result in an immaterial effect on consolidated earnings or cash flows 
this discussion of market risks necessarily makes forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values will not differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to greater than changes in interest rates or changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in debt instruments or cash flows associated with them 
at august   the company held no derivatives
