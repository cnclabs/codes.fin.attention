the company has a bank loan agreement bank agreement which includes a term loan  encompassing a tranche a and b  and a million revolving credit facility 
at december   the tranche a had a balance of million and matures over the period to  and the tranche b had a balance of million and matures over the period and the revolving credit facility expires in  and  availability under the facility at december  was million  after reduction of million for outstanding letters of credit 
the bank agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of of the capital stock of the company s direct domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries  as defined in the bank agreement 
the bank agreement also requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests  and includes limitations with respect to  among other things  indebtedness and restricted payments  including dividends on the company s common stock

the agreement expires in may with respect to million of accounts receivable and expires in july with respect to an additional million of accounts receivable

ebitda is not a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not an alternative to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
the company believes that ebitda provides additional information for determining its ability to meet future debt service requirements  however  ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements 
the company s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures  product development activities and debt service requirements 
the company s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its senior subordinated notes due notes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow  the company s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the company s current sale of accounts receivable agreement 
the company expects that operating and capital expenditures  product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources  however  the company s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the company s products  a deterioration in certain of the company s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the company s accounts receivable 
the company has not paid  and does not have any present intention to commence payment of  cash dividends on its common stock

million of such proceeds was used to redeem million principal amount of notes at a price of and the balance of the proceeds was used to pay down term debt under the bank agreement 
the redemption of notes resulted in an extraordinary loss for the early extinguishment of debt consisting of a prepayment premium and the write off of related deferred debt issuance costs of million  less tax benefits of million 
environmental matters subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december honeywell  amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites 
amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site 
the responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between amphenol and honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in for sites covered by this agreement  to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition  honeywell is currently obligated to pay of the costs up to million and of the costs in excess of million 
at december   approximately million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement 
honeywell representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities 
management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
risk management the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions 
in other cases involving us export sales  raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale  such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products 
allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts  discounts  returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience  current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates average cost  or market 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
depreciable assets property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the appropriateness and the recoverablility of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions 
the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital  although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had interest rate volatility protection in the form of such swaps that effectively fixed the company s libor interest rate on million of floating rate bank debt at 
at december   the three month libor rate was 
these swap agreements expire in a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 
million 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
