this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
healthstream s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed and those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion provides an overview of our history together with a summary of our revenue recognition policies  policy regarding impairment of long lived assets  and the significant current year transactions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for strategic alliances and acquisitions 
overview and critical accounting policies healthstream was incorporated in and began marketing its internet based solutions in march the company evolved from an initial focus of providing multimedia tools for information dissemination to a facilitator of training tools for entities in the healthcare industry 
revenues from the healthcare organization business unit are derived from the following categories provision of services through our internet based e learning products  content subscriptions  licensing  maintenance and support of installed learning management products  content subscriptions  custom content development  and a variety of online and enduring products 
revenues from the pharmaceutical and medical device companies are derived from live event development  coordination  and registration services  web cast events  online development and training  and other educational and training services 
internet based e learning products and content subscriptions are provided on a per person subscription basis with fees ranging from over to more than per month  based on the size of the facility and the content offerings 
contracts for e learning products range from  to approximately  based on the duration of the contract  number of users and content involved 
revenue derived from the provision of services through our internet based e learning products are recognized ratably over the term of the service agreement 
the company also offers training services for hlc users to facilitate integration of this technology 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
other transaction based online services are provided based on a fee ranging from to per underlying credit hour  or based upon access to a body of content for a defined period of time 
most courses provide one to three credit hours  however  during we began selling board review courses that include significantly more credit 
we recognize revenue for online content subscription services ratably over the subscription period and recognize revenue for transaction based online course sales when the course is delivered 
training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
late in  we began entering into arrangements that provide for commercial support of online courseware 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the term unless usage exceeds the ratable portion 
as discussed in risk factors above  revenue recognition policies for internet based e learning products and other services vary significantly from our installed learning management products 
revenues from installed learning management products are recognized upon shipment or installation of the software 
the one time license fee typically ranges from  to  based on the number of users 
revenues related to installed learning management products may be subject to fluctuations because purchases of these licenses typically are included in customers capital expenditure budgets 
services such as training  maintenance and technical support are provided either based on a fixed fee  estimated usage or actual time incurred 
maintenance and technical support revenues are recognized over the term of the service period 
revenues derived from the sale of products requiring significant modification  conversion or customization are recorded based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours 
training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
we recognize custom content development revenues based on the percentage of a project that is completed 
we recognize revenue from live event development and coordination services based on the percentage of completion method using labor hours 
event registration services are recognized upon completion of the related event 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of drug and product introductions and budget cycles for such companies 
we accounted for long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  statement through december  in accordance with statement  we reviewed internal and external factors to determine whether events or changes in facts and circumstances were present and indicative of an impairment of long lived assets 
this review included estimates of future cash flows related to such long lived assets 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to impairment of long lived assets during the year ended december  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  will be adopted as of january  effective october   we entered into a new four year agreement with hca  replacing the prior agreement with columbia information systems  inc that had approximately two and one half years remaining 
together with hca  we mutually agreed to cancel the warrant held by cis holdings  inc  an affiliate of hca  to purchase our common stock 
as a result  we are no longer amortizing the remaining cost of the warrant as a reduction of revenues 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenues through september  provided under the prior service agreement that included the grant of the warrant to cis holdings  inc  were recognized as services were rendered  net of the amortization of the fair value of the related warrant as a reduction of the revenues proportionately over the term of the four year agreement 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and services to healthcare workers through healthcare organizations 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based e learning products will increase 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the transaction fees for courseware resulting from this marketing may either be paid by the employer or sponsoring organization or  in the case of healthcare professionals  may be billed directly to the individual 
our internet based e learning model allows us to host our system in a central data center  therefore eliminating the need for costly onsite installations of our software 
under the internet based e learning model  revenues are generated by charging for use of our courseware on a subscription basis 
in addition  we will continue to sell services on our web site on a transaction basis 
in february  we entered into a five year agreement with webmd corporation  formerly healtheon webmd  webmd 
the agreement provided that we would be the exclusive provider of education  continuing education and training services for all healthcare organizations  healthcare professionals and healthcare workers on all web sites owned or operated by webmd in exchange for certain guaranteed payments 
webmd also purchased million of our common stock in a private sale that closed concurrently with our ipo 
during  we expensed and paid webmd million 
at december   we accrued but did not pay royalties related to this agreement of million 
on january   we terminated the prior agreement with webmd and set forth a new business arrangement 
under the new  non exclusive three year agreement  we will be a preferred provider of continuing medical education  continuing education and board preparation courses for webmd s professional portal 
under this new arrangement  financial consideration is based entirely on revenues generated from the sale of healthstream s services to webmd s professional portal customers 
we have acquired the following companies since all of which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting de medici systems

as a result of the acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill of million and million of other acquisition intangibles at december  goodwill and intangibles  net of accumulated amortization  represented and of total assets and and of total shareholders equity at december  and  respectively 
our weighted average amortization period is years 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect amortization expense to decline during as a result of new accounting standards 
we expect to continue to transition m  synquest  and de medici customers from existing platforms to our internet based e learning products  and therefore expect that revenues will remain comparable or improve when compared to the annual maintenance fees with increases related to sales of additional content and courseware 
to date  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technologies  create  license and acquire our content  build brand awareness  develop our infrastructure and expand our business  and have yet to achieve significant revenues or generate positive operating cash flows 
as a result  we have incurred operating losses in each fiscal quarter since we expect operating losses and negative cash flow to continue through  as we continue to expand our business and develop synergies with the companies we have acquired 
these costs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
results of operations revenues and expense components the following descriptions of the components of revenues and expenses apply to the comparison of results of operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we began producing discrete financial information under two reportable segments during healthcare organizations and professionals hco and pharmaceutical and medical device companies pmd

compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately million  or  to million for from approximately million for revenues for consisted of million for hco and million for pmd 
in  revenues consisted of million for hco and million for pmd 
the growth in hco revenues over related primarily to growth in our internet based learning network  while pmd increases resulted primarily from live event development  coordination and registration services associated with the full year impact of the acquisition of edi 
we expect hco revenues to increase during as a result of continued growth in internet based e learning product revenues as well as due to the elimination of warrant expense as a reduction of revenues 
we expect hco revenues associated with the installed learning management products to decline as customers continue to transition to the internet based e learning products 
we expect pmd revenues to grow as well primarily due to increased penetration of live event business 
revenues for and are presented net of warrant expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
during  of revenues related to live event development  coordination and registration services  related to maintenance and support fees for our installed learning management products  related to our internet based e learning products  related to other transactions and product sales including commercial support  related to online development services  related to our installed learning management product licensing fees and related to web cast events

we expect revenues to continue to increase during cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased approximately million  or  to million for from approximately million for the increase was primarily due to additional personnel associated with implementation of internet based e learning products  higher direct costs associated with live event development  coordination and registration services and growth in other direct expenses that increase along with related revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for from for this decrease as a percentage of revenues resulted from lower costs associated with installed learning management products and lower fixed costs associated with internet based e learning products 
we expect that cost of revenues will increase during  but decrease as a percentage of revenues as internet based e learning product revenues increase 
this change is attributable to the fact that a large component of the costs associated with the internet based e learning products are of a fixed nature 
cost of goods approximated of revenues for hco and of revenues for pmd during we expect costs of goods to decrease as a percentage of revenues for hco in as a result of continued growth in revenues associated with internet based e learning products 
we expect cost of goods to increase as a percentage of revenues during for pmd as a result of additional personnel associated with new product teams 
product development 
product development expenses decreased approximately million  or  to million for from approximately million for as a percentage of revenues  product development expenses decreased to for from for this decrease was due primarily to lower installed learning management product support costs 
we expect product development expenses to increase slightly during  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues  as a result of continued reductions in installed learning product maintenance and content development during  which we expect to be offset by investments in new product development 
such new product efforts may be somewhat mitigated by capitalization of new product developments if such investments result in technologically feasible products during product development expenses as a percentage of revenues approximated for hco and for pmd in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  including personnel costs  increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase related primarily to an increase of million related to personnel costs associated with additional sales personnel and the full year impact of the synquest acquisition in september as well as increased commissions associated with new contract value in this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million associated with lower advertising and marketing spending in as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in from in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase during  but decrease as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues approximated for hco and for pmd for during  we expect sales and marketing for hco to remain fairly consistent with levels  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues as revenues continue to grow 
for pmd  we expect sales and marketing to increase both in total and as a percentage of revenues as we focus on further penetration of existing customer relationships and introduction of new products 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase consisted of a million increase in amortization  primarily associated with the acquisition of de medici and the full year impact of the acquisitions of synquest and edi 
the depreciation increase of million related to the impact of fixed asset additions associated with the acquisitions and those added in the normal course of business 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect amortization expense to decline during as a result of new accounting standards 
while depreciation will increase as a result of capital expenditures during  amortization will decrease as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization upon the adoption of new accounting standards 
depreciation and amortization for both hco and pmd is expected to decline in both in total and as a percentage of revenues as a result of implementation of new accounting standards 
other general and administrative 
other general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million for from approximately million for as a percentage of revenues  other general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for the decrease is attributable to a million gain on the renegotiation of the webmd agreement during as well as the elimination of million in fixed royalties incurred during associated with the webmd arrangement 
the gain and decline in fixed royalties were somewhat offset by the full year impact of the synquest and edi acquisitions  which resulted in additional administrative personnel and facility expenses 
the impact of these acquisitions was partially mitigated by the consolidation of offices and administrative functions during we expect other general and administrative expenses to decline during both in total and as a percentage of revenues  primarily as a result of actions taken to consolidate functions during other general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues approximated for hco and for pmd during we expect other general and administrative expenses for hco to decline in total and as a percentage of revenues during as a result of consolidation of facilities and duplicative functions

in addition  revenues from installed learning management systems may be subject to fluctuations because purchases of these licenses typically are included in customers capital expenditure budgets  and sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of drug and product introductions and budget cycles for such companies 
during the second quarter of  the company closed two office locations and recorded a one time office consolidation charge 
further  during our evaluation of long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations largely through proceeds from our ipo  private placements of equity securities  loans from related parties and  to a lesser extent  from revenues generated from the sale of our products and services 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in and million in cash used in operating activities during related to the million net loss  increases in accounts and unbilled receivables  prepaid development fees  deferred revenue and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets  other assets  and accrued liabilities 
these operating uses of cash were offset by the million gain on the webmd renegotiation  non cash warrant expense of million  office consolidation charge of million  impairment charges of million  depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  as well as other non cash expenses 
cash used in operating activities during was attributable to funding net operating losses and increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  which were partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities and depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in and million in cash used in investing activities during was primarily related to the purchase of investments of million  property and equipment of million  issuance of a note receivable of million  and the acquisition of de medici systems of million  which were offset by the sale and redemption of investments of million and the million received for the repayment of a note 
cash used in investing activities during was primarily for the purchase of investments of million  property and equipment of million and the acquisitions made in of million  partially offset by the receipt of million of cash from the sale of investments by the company 
cash used in financing activities was approximately million in and cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in cash used in financing activities during related to the repurchase of  shares of common stock from webmd for million and million related to payments under capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities in related primarily to the ipo and a private placement of common stock  net of offering costs and repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and related interest receivable 
we have no bank credit facility or other indebtedness other than capital lease obligations 
as of february   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and related interest receivable of approximately million 
we believe that the net proceeds from the ipo and the preceding private offerings received during will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital  new product development  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our growth strategy may also include acquiring companies that complement our products and services 
we anticipate that these acquisitions  if any  will be effected through a combination of stock and cash consideration 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required during or following that period in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
commitments and contingencies in connection with our october agreement with hca  hca will pay us minimum revenues of million over the four year term of the agreement 
we expect that our capital expenses will be approximately to million in our strategic alliances have typically provided for payments to distribution  content and development partners based on revenues  and we expect to continue similar arrangements in the future 
as a result  our commitments for variable payments approximate  related to agreements under which other companies have agreed to provide content development services for us 
in addition to these commitments  our lease obligations outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements include approximately  in   in   in   in   in and  thereafter 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  statement and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply statement beginning january  while we have not completed the assessment of the impact of the statement  application of the non amortization provisions of the statement would result in a decrease in net loss of approximately million per share per year 
this estimate is based on our current level of amortization expense for intangibles with indefinite lives and the current weighted average shares outstanding 
during  we will perform the test for goodwill impairment using the two step process described in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount  if any  of impairment 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first six months of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement will be adopted as of january  we have reviewed the provisions of statement  and believe that upon adoption  the statement will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the statement supersedes fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we do not have any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness other than approximately  of capital lease arrangements 
accordingly  the company is not exposed to significant interest rate market risk 
the company is exposed to market risk with respect to its cash and investment balances 
at december   the company had cash and investments totaling approximately million 
at this investment level  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income and increase the net loss on an annualized basis by approximately  the company manages its investment risk by investing in corporate debt securities  foreign corporate debt and secured corporate debt securities with minimum acceptable credit ratings 
for certificates of deposit and corporate obligations  ratings must be a a or better  a p or better for commercial paper  a a or better for taxable or tax advantaged auction rate securities and aaa or better for tax free auction rate securities 
the company also requires that all securities must mature within months from the original settlement date  the average portfolio shall not exceed months  and the greater of or million shall mature within days 
further  the company s investment policy also limits concentration exposure and other potential risk areas 
the above market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward looking statements of market risk assuming the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of actual developments in the market
