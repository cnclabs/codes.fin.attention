item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition liquidity 
direct sales organization during the early launch stages of our marketing program  our senior management is managing and conducting our marketing activities for our x traweb tm products and services 
a target market oriented  direct sales organization has been established that has responsibility for specific geographic regions  and coordinates the activities of outside marketing partners  including value added resellers and information technology consultants within those regions 
currently  there are three employees focused on direct sales in the united states 
we also engage independent commission agents to market our products in the energy and other targeted markets 
as we expand our operations  we plan to hire additional sales personnel  or engage additional independent commission agents  to cover new markets and augment the services of sales and marketing personnel in certain larger markets 
strategic marketing alliances as an integral part of our marketing program  we are establishing strategic marketing alliances with outside companies that have strong influence within the respective target markets for our x traweb tm products and services 
we will seek to align ourselves with partners that are capable of substantially accelerating our penetration of a target market or of adding material value to our marketing program through the reduction of costs  managerial infrastructure  and other economic advantages 
we have implemented a sales plan targeting and pursuing prospective customers through organizations such as management consulting firms  computer networking consultants and value added resellers 
we are in discussions to form marketing alliances in the residential security  facilities management and internet sectors 
moreover  we have formed several such alliances to date in the natural gas and energy sectors 
our staff formerly worked with texaco natural gas inc to market our x traweb products to customers in the natural gas field 
we are also working with cooperative connextions  llc to market our x traweb products and services to rural electrical utilities operating in approximately states west of the mississippi river 
our technology offers these co marketing partners a value added component to the services already being provided to their existing customers 
these co marketing partners provide us with a credible avenue of introduction to other potential customers for our products and services 
advertising and promotions an integral part of our long term marketing plan is the generation of awareness within the target markets for our products and services 
we allocate a portion of our budget toward ongoing advertising  promotions  and public relations activities  including direct mail  trade print media advertising  trade show participation and sales personnel incentives 
to reach an even wider audience as we continue to develop widespread awareness of our portal and proprietary telemetry solutions  we plan to implement an advertising and promotional support program designed to establish x traweb as a recognized brand name that is especially familiar to decision makers within our target markets  and synonymous with premier quality technology and products  highly effective services and tangible cost efficiencies  enhance our branding efforts through the use of industry experts to promote our product and services  position our technological capabilities  management  products  services and level of support as an industry standard 
we also plan to implement advertising in trade publications on a regular basis 
we have appointed a public relations firm  with substantial expertise in the information technology industry  to assist us in the development and execution of periodic public relations campaigns  including campaigns coordinated with new product introductions in existing markets and expanded introductions to new markets 
we have also highlighted our activities through occasional articles in trade publications and national business newspapers 
we have participated in regional  national and international trade shows that are conducted for industries that comprise our target markets  including telemetry and internet technology industry trade shows such as the annual trade show cibet in hannover  germany and comdex in las vegas  nevada 
we intend to maintain a regular presence at key trade shows throughout our development  and use our presence at such events to not only attract customers  but also generate follow on marketing opportunities  subject to budget constraints imposed by the terms of the notes 
in the past we have invested heavily in such advertising and promotions 
in we spent approximately  and in we spent approximately  in such activities 
however  our budget constraints have significantly curtailed these advertising plans  and we anticipate spending only  to execute the marketing and promotion plans during because of our limited resources  and restriction on our spending  it is possible that we will further curtail these activities 
research and development we invest significantly in research and development activities 
these activities consist of proprietary development on our spread spectrum radios and x traweb tm products and services 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development in the future  subject  however  to the limitation that we cannot incur a monthly burn rate greater than  in any month  while the notes are outstanding 
thus  our research efforts will be significantly curtailed during such period 
also  in october  we closed down our kansas city office  where our research and development activities were primarily conducted 
we will continue to engage in research and development activities for our own products  on a limited basis as discussed above 
current and future projects include new spread spectrum transceivers in the ghz band  improving x traweb tm products to enable plug and play developer kits  improved x traweb components such as the x tracam tm  a camera that captures video images and transmits them to the internet without the use of a personal computer where they can be viewed using a standard browser  and similar projects 
manufacturing until december   we also performed manufacturing services for other manufacturers and vendors of medical  communications  computer graphics and consumer electronic products at our salt lake city manufacturing facility  and sold antennas from our gonic  new hampshire facility 
we discontinued our direct manufacturing operations effective as of december   and now outsource the manufacturing activities of our products through third parties except antennae which we manufacture directly 
these third party manufacturers include a taiwan based company and several domestic manufacturers 
contract design and development general at the present time  we are not seeking design and development service contracts except in partnering situations in which we would have an ownership interest in the products and or technology which are the subject of the contract and which promote the sale of our proprietary products  such as our x traweb tm products 
for example  we typically provide certain engineering services for the application of our x traweb tm products for use in a specific application or applications desired by a vending machine manufacturer or a manufacturer of fast food restaurant equipment or for installation in the monitoring of a gas pipeline or the control system in a refrigeration storage unit or office management system 
formerly  we were engaged in providing engineering  design and development services to client specifications on a fee for services basis 
under one significant contract  we developed a low cost spread spectrum technology for use in certain products sold by kyushu matsushita electric co  ltd 
kme  which is also known as panasonic which is more fully described below 
we also developed devices for use in the automatic meter reading field for williams wireless  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the williams companies 
kyushu matsushita electric co 
ltd 
panasonic contract in april  we acquired a corporation by merger in  which entered into a contract with kyushu matsushita electric co  ltd 
to develop low cost spread spectrum radio technology for use in certain panasonic products 
as part of our development contract with kme  we granted kme a world wide  non exclusive license to use or authorize the use of any patents  copyrights  technical know how and other intellectual property rights embodied in our lcssr technology in the manufacture of kme products  and agreed not to license others to use technology which is developed under our contract with kme in connection with any telephone related products for a period of two years from the first shipment of kme products using the technology 
in consideration for these rights and our services  kme agreed to pay royalties to us on sales of kme products using the technology above a prescribed minimum amount of sales for a period of two years from the initial shipments of any such products 
during   or about of the  royalty income we recognized was earned under this contract and we have not received any further royalties therefrom since such contract expired in september  competition we have a number of current competitors in all aspects of our business  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us  and which include such industrial giants as panasonic  motorola  sony and at t 
we intend to compete in our industry by concentrating on certain product or service niches within the overall market 
however  most of our competitors offer products which have one or more features or functions similar to those offered by us  and many have the resources available to develop products with features and functions  competitive with or superior to those offered by us 
we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop superior features or functions in their products or that the we will be able to maintain a lower cost advantage for our products 
a key element of our competitive strategy is to align ourself with major manufacturers by developing proprietary products or technology for market leaders that can be incorporated into its partner manufacturers products 
we formerly had a marketing alliance with texaco natural gas inc  and currently have such alliances with cooperative connextions  llc to market our x traweb products in the united states and with audiotel spa for marketing such products in italy 
we previously licensed low cost spread spectrum technology for use in certain products sold by panasonic which agreement expired in september  and entered into a var agreement with motorola  inc to sell its moscad remote terminal units 
we also believe that our agreements with kme ie  panasonic  and motorola  illustrate the manner in which we can partner with much larger  established companies to access mass markets for our proprietary wireless communications products and technology 
our management has identified five primary competitors offering either telemetry related products and services or web enabled technologies itron  a developer and manufacturer of automated meter reading solutions  including wired and wireless automated meter reading devices  spyglass  inc which develops software and firmware  including web enabling firmware for embedded microcontrollers  emware  a provider of distributed embedded device networking software that provides internet connectivity for any device that scales from bit microcontrollers to bit microprocessors  connect one  a developer and manufacturer of internet connectivity solutions that enable devices to connect to the internet without requiring a pc  and phar lap software  inc  a provider of realtime operating systems and software development tools for applications 
while each of these companies offers products and or services that have some parallels to those provided by x traweb  none currently provides  to our knowledge  the type of cost effective  total solution approach that we do 
in addition  we believe we combine successfully all of the necessary technical elements with the additional capability for wireless system integration and communications 
in addition  our management has identified two key competitors in the radio products field 
however  our management believes that our radios provide better performance at a lower price for comparable radios offered by such companies 
employees as of december  we had employees 
of these employees  were classified as executive  as administrative personnel  as engineering  and as sales and marketing 
our employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit  and we are not aware of any labor union organizing activity 
patents and intellectual property we believe that reliance upon trade secrets  copyrights and unpatented proprietary know how in conjunction with the development of new products is at least as important as patent protection in our business since most patents provide fairly narrow protection  and are of limited value in areas of rapid technological change 
further  patents require public disclosure of information that may otherwise be subject to trade secret protection 
we presently own two united states patents covering antenna technology  and have a united states patent which covers spread spectrum demodulation technology 
spread spectrum communication is a method for transmitting and receiving coded information that is resistant to interference due to the fact that the transmission is spread over a large bandwidth 
this method requires  however  that both the transmitter and the receiver have the same spreading code ie  a pre determined  fixed pattern used to spread the information over the larger bandwidth 
the purpose of the technology covered by our spread spectrum patent is to recover and remove the spreading code from a transmission signal  and thus obtain the original information  in a simpler  less expensive manner 
under the terms of a litigation settlement entered into with a former co venturer  we agreed that our former co venturer is entitled to full and equal ownership with us  of the spread spectrum demodulation technology covered by the patent application  including the right to incorporate  develop  utilize and exploit the technology 
any uses or products developed or derived from such technology  however  shall be the sole property of the party which develops or derives such uses or products 
in addition  if one of the parties elects to prosecute the patent application prior to final acceptance or rejection by the us patent office  failure by the other party to contribute equally to the costs of prosecuting the application will result in the loss of its rights to the technology 
at this time  we do not have any plans to prosecute this patent application  and are unaware of any plans by our former co venturer to prosecute the application 
in addition  during we filed a united states patent application for each of two separate software codes 
furthermore  during  we filed four us patent applications on various operating aspects of the x traweb tm system  although we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued to us 
williams wireless  inc williams raised a claim that we violated the non competition provisions of their agreements by allegedly marketing x traweb tm products in the telemetry meter reading applications 
we  in turn  claimed that williams wireless  inc failed to satisfy all of its duties under its various agreements with us 
while we believed that williams claim was properly disputable  the parties orally agreed to enter into a settlement agreement and mutual release 
on march   before such settlement agreement was concluded  williams sold substantially all of its assets and business  including its agreements with us  to an unrelated party  internet telemetry corp 
itc  and thereafter we resolved this dispute amicably 
we and itc entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release dated as of august   which contained the following key elements a each party released the other of any claims under the williams agreements with us  and the parties terminated such agreements in all respects  b we agreed to grant itc a perpetual  non exclusive irrevocable royalty free worldwide license to manufacture  use and sell our microhopper radio  as configured on the date of our agreement  as a component of itc s telemetry systems or products  and to manufacture  use and sell such radio only when incorporated into itc s telemetry systems or products  c each party agreed to allow the other party to resell the other s products pursuant to a standard resellers agreement adopted by such party  and d each party agreed to indemnify the other from any claims arising under such agreement 
we believe that this agreement will have no material adverse effect on our business 
we have not filed any patent applications in foreign countries 
item properties as of december   our executive offices and principal administrative offices are located at greenwood plaza boulevard  greenwood village  colorado in approximately  square feet of space which is leased at a monthly cost of  for base rental and allocable common area maintenance charges 
we also pay for certain utility expenses 
the five year lease for these premises expires on december  in addition  we continue to operate our facility in gonic  new hampshire of approximately  square feet at a monthly rent of  prior to november  we also maintained leased offices in overland park  kansas of approximately  square feet at a monthly rent of  which we discontinued at such time 
we believe that our facilities are satisfactory for our present scale of operations 
we have obligations under various equipment leases which are not material 
item legal proceedings on february  the pinnacle fund lp  barry m 
kitt and tom and denise hunse filed a lawsuit against us with respect to the purchase of a total of  shares of our common stock at per share in a private placement transaction in february the plaintiffs seek rescission of the transaction and or damages  including treble damages  which they allege arise out of our failure to file a registration statement on or before december  the lawsuit is currently pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
the case is in the discovery stage  with certain parties having exchanged documents and written responses to questions asked 
in december  the district court in utah approved the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their pleadings to commence a lawsuit against five individual defendants david d 
singer  an officer director  donald i 
wallace  a former officer director  malcolm thomas  a director  charles taylor  a director and a former officer  kevin childress and to assert an additional cause of action against them for the underlying state law securities claim against the company  and new causes of action against the company for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and promissory estoppel  and a new cause of action for fraud against mr 
singer 
the company and individual defendants recently filed answers to these new claims in the case 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to such action and intend to prosecute our defense of the action vigorously  but there can be no assurance as to the outcome thereof 
we will also vigorously contest these new additional claims and believe we have meritorious defenses to these new claims  and it is anticipated that the individual defendants named in the lawsuit will do the same  although we cannot assure you of the result in such lawsuit

in june  which are designed to offer various services of x traweb products and to provide financing capability of sales of x traweb products or services  respectively  although neither entity derived any revenues as of december  our cost of sales for compared to declined to  in from a total of  in  or a reduction of  or 
the resulting gross profit was  or of sales  for compared to  or  for this represents an improvement of in gross profit margin percentage for the comparable periods 
the improvement in gross margin is expected to continue as we shift towards higher profit margin business 
our research and development expenses increased to  from  or by  or  for the comparable twelve month periods ended december  versus december  these costs continue to relate to the ongoing application development of the x traweb tm propriety technology in our total selling  general  and administrative expenses amounted to  for compared to  for  representing an increase of  or 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  during over and represents a significant increase in advertising  promotion  and sales related travel to market our x traweb tm products as discussed above 
total general and administrative expenses for the comparable december  and december  period decreased by  or about  and resulted from a decrease in compensation expense related to stock options accounted for as variable options totaling  a decrease in depreciation of  or  and a savings of  or  in facilities rent due to the termination of the salt lake city lease 
these expense savings were substantially offset by an increase in corporate travel related expenses of  for promotion of x traweb tm products  the opening of the x traweb europe offices  and other international business opportunities  and increases of  in compensation and benefits  new stock exchange fees expense for the american stock exchange of  and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable of  expenses for were reduced by  as the result of the reversal of previously accrued manufacturing exit costs 
the favorable settlement of the lease obligation on our salt lake city  utah manufacturing and office facilities resulted in a recovery of  an additional  was recovered as the result of the sale of manufacturing equipment to a third party 
total manufacturing exit costs recognized in were  our interest income for was  compared to  for  with the increase directly attributable to increased available funds in overnight interest bearing accounts provided by the million private placement of shares of our common stock we sold in the first quarter of interest expense declined to  during compared to  for  and represents a decrease of  or 
this expense reduction is directly related to our retirement of substantially all of our debt  and related debt discount amortization  in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources our liquidity at december  consist of cash and cash equivalents of  which represents a decrease of  over our cash and cash equivalents as of december  we had a working capital deficit of  at the end of compared to working capital of  as of the end of our liquidity decreased significantly due to cash used in operating activities of  caused primarily by our net loss 
we funded our negative cash flow in by consuming most of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at the beginning of the year and by borrowing  from related parties during as discussed below these borrowings are a component of the working capital deficit 
on may   we issued  of our senior secured convertible notes to an affiliate of our largest stockholder  which were to mature on september  unless mandatorily converted into shares of our common stock before such date 
the notes are secured by a first security interest in substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the note issuance  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
during the third quarter of  we received an additional  in loans from an affiliate of our largest stockholder  comprising part of the notes 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an additional  as loans from such affiliates 
these additional loans are also part of the notes 
we also issued detachable five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock as a result of these additional loans 
for a further description of this financing see senior secured indebtedness financing under item thus  as of december   we received a total of  in loans from such affiliates 
based on our current cash position and our plans for  we believe that additional capital will be required by mid april we recently received additional loans of  from affiliates of our largest stockholder during january  february and march  which management believes is adequate to fund our operations through april  our agreement with lancer offshore  inc and lancer partners lp also allows for such loan to be increased to a total of  from its current outstanding principal amount of  provided that both parties agree to do so  although we cannot assure you of such mutual agreement 
we previously obtained a financing commitment letter totaling  from a third party  to be provided as private equity placements on or before may   which management believed was adequate to fund our operations in the funding party did not provide the financing within the terms of the commitment  and to date  no funds have been received thereunder 
we and the funding party have agreed to allow the funding party to seek substitute financing through february  as the result of the foregoing events and since the current  loan from the affiliates matures on june   we are currently seeking funding from other sources 
going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
the company has sustained recurring losses from operations  and has a working capital deficiency  a stockholders deficit and does not have the necessary funds to repay our debt  which is all due on june  as operations have not generated sufficient amounts of cash  we have relied upon financing from affiliates of our largest shareholders to fund operations since may these affiliates have extended the due dates of the notes several times during and once during there is no guarantee that debt holders will continue to do so in the future 
the timing of our attainment of profitable operations and sufficient additional financing cannot be determined at this time 
moreover  the monthly burn rate limitation of  imposed on us under our secured financing hampers the conduct of business operations 
these uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
summary during  we implemented our redirection efforts to focus on the growth of our x traweb tm business segment and proprietary radio products 
we raised  in new equity capital  paid off substantially all outstanding debt  redeemed all mandatorily redeemable preferred stock outstanding  and relocated our corporate headquarters to the denver  colorado area 
also  we realized revenues from the sales of our x traweb products for the first time during and signed various marketing alliance agreements during the year 
during  we continued to focus on our sales of x traweb tm products and services but did not realize revenues at the level that we expected or needed 
as a result of the slower receipt of revenues from the sale of our x traweb tm products  we decided in july to focus our activities principally on the sale of such products in the automatic meter reading and facilities management fields in part due to the recent energy crisis experienced in parts of the united states  although we will continue to market our products in the areas of i vending machines  ii security systems and iii food services equipment 
we also decided to reduce the number of out employees  particularly in the engineering and administrative areas  ceased the operations of our italian subsidiaries  x tra web europe  spa  and also closed our office in kansas city  kansas 
thus as of december  we had a total of employees  a reduction of from the total of employees we had as of december  while we believe that i a number of our pending proposals for projects or products will be accepted in whole or in part  ii we will develop additional sources of sales in the united states  italy and other foreign countries and iii will derive substantial revenues therefrom in and thereafter  we cannot assure you that any such sales will be made or the amount thereof  although we anticipate that x traweb tm product sales will constitute the bulk of our revenues during the year and thereafter 
we also believe that we will derive significant revenues from the sale of our proprietary radio products in the future  but we cannot assure you as to the amount of such sales or when such sales will occur 
we do not expect the sales of our antenna products to contribute materially to our consolidated net sales or income in the foreseeable future 
in summary  we are fully aware that anticipated revenue increases from sales of our x traweb tm products and our proprietary radios are by no means assured  and that our requirements for capital are substantial 
if significant revenues with adequate margins are not generated and or the additional financing is not obtained  we have a contingency plan to further reduce overhead and other operating costs so as to remain a going concern through june   the due date of our notes payable 
these contingency plans  however  would require additional reductions in product development and marketing costs  which could impact the timing and ultimate amount of future revenues 
moreover  by virtue of the factors listed under going concern immediately above  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on continued support from our lenders unless alternate capital sources are secured 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on july   statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations became effective 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method 
the adoption of sfas did not have any significant impact on our financial statements 
effective january  we were required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment by means of a fair value based test 
as of december   we had no unamortized goodwill 
we believe the implementation of sfas will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we will adopt sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  no later than january  under sfas  the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation covered under the scope of sfas would be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability would be accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost would be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity would either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
we are still studying this newly issued standard to determine  among other things  whether we have any asset retirement obligations which are covered under the scope of sfas the effect on us of adopting this standard  if any  has not yet been determined 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas is effective for the fiscal year beginning  but is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements
