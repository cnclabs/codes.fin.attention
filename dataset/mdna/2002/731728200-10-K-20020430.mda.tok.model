all amounts are in united states dollars  unless otherwise denoted 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the operations of the company are carried on through dextran products limited dextran products in canada and through chemdex  inc chemdex in the united states 
the operations of chemdex are carried on through its wholly owned subsidiary  veterinary laboratories  inc vet labs 
each of dextran products and chemdex operates as a strategic business unit 
dextran products manufactures and sells bulk quantities of dextran and several of its derivatives to large pharmaceutical companies throughout the world 
chemdex manufactures and sells veterinary pharmaceutical products and specialty chemicals in the united states 
the primary customers are distributors and private labelers  who in turn sell to the end user of these products 
sales of the company decreased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decline in sales was primarily due to a decline in volume at chemdex  where sales decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal chemdex sales accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal sales of the company increased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the sales increase in was primarily attributable to increased sales at chemdex 
chemdex products are broken down into product lines 
injectables is the largest product line accounting for and of chemdex sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales of injectable products decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to overall weak market demand in the food producing animal sector along with unit sales price reductions caused by competitive pricing 
these market conditions decreased both sales and gross margins particularly in the second and third quarters and accounted for almost of the fiscal declines 
management expects these factors to continue for the first two quarters of fiscal management expects improvement during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal but overall expectations for the general market in fiscal are that sales will be level for the current product lines 
management expects total sales for fiscal to increase and exceed that of fiscal as a result of expanding the existing product lines to include new products assuming the united states food and drug administration fda grants approval of pending abbreviated new animal drug applications anadas 
there are several anada submissions currently awaiting approval by the fda 
management is planning for the introduction of several new products  the first of which will commence sales in the third quarter of fiscal  pending this regulatory approval 
sales at dextran products decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal dextran products sales accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal demand for dextran and related products remained consistent during the year and management expects such consistent demand to continue 
sales levels are expected to increase slightly next year 
the company s gross profit decreased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the company s gross profit decreased to from in fiscal chemdex gross profit decreased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of chemdex sales  chemdex gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in gross profit at chemdex was attributable to a reduction in sales due to market weakness and pricing declines 
management anticipates the fda approval of pending anadas during the coming year will result in an increase in profit margins 
dextran products gross profit  excluding profit on intercompany sales  was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of dextran products sales  dextran products gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the majority of dextran products costs are incurred in canadian dollars  while the majority of its sales are in us dollars 
therefore if the canadian dollar decreases in relation to the us dollar  margins increase 
the increase in margin resulting from the increase in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar was offset by an increase in costs which could not be passed along to customers 
other revenue of  in fiscal resulted from a payment from a collaborator on a research and development project 
there were no similar payments received in fiscal selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from   in fiscal this decrease is a result of senior management foregoing bonuses in fiscal senior management bonuses totaled  in fiscal selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal from  in fiscal mainly due to hiring an investor relations firm during the third quarter of fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  promotion  general  and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  the company spent  on research and development expenditures as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal this decrease of  or from fiscal to fiscal is a result of sustained funding by research and development partners 
although funding from all sources for these research and development projects is expected to continue  the company does not expect its portion of these costs to increase in the short term 
the increase of  or from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to new product development costs relating to the development of a raw material for a human pharmaceutical product and the cellulose sulphate project at dextran products  and the development of new products at vet labs 
development costs for new products are expected to continue in fiscal  but at similar levels 
investment tax credits are claimed by dextran products to offset the cost of research and development 
the total investment tax credit benefit recognized in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal as a result  the company recorded research and development expense  net of investment tax credits  of   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation and amortization decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a piece of production equipment being sold during the year at dextran products and certain production equipment becoming fully depreciated 
interest expense decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in imputed interest on long term payables of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in imputed interest is due to the repayment of this non interest bearing debt 
in addition dextran products extinguished two long term debt obligations during fiscal loss from operations for the company in fiscal totaled  as compared to income from operations of  in fiscal chemdex experienced a loss from operations of  in fiscal  as compared to income from operations of  in fiscal this decrease in income from operations is a result of the decrease in sales and gross profit  as described above 
income from operations at dextran products in fiscal was  an increase of  or from  in fiscal this increase in income from operations is a result of the significant decrease in research and development expenses  as described above 
interest and other non operating income decreased by or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  other income included  as a preliminary settlement of a class action lawsuit  in favor of chemdex  against various vitamin suppliers 
in fiscal chemdex received a final settlement payment of  for this lawsuit 
in fiscal  dextran products incurred a loss of  on disposal of production equipment that is netted against other income 
there was no such loss in fiscal in addition  interest income earned at dextran products in fiscal is less than in fiscal because of the lower average cash balance during fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes exceeds income before income taxes because of the losses incurred in the bahamas  for which there is no tax recovery 
a tax provision of  relating to dextran products was recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase in the canadian tax provision is a result of the increase in profitability of dextran products in fiscal the canadian operations continue to have significant research and development tax pools to offset current taxes payable 
as a result of the foregoing  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share in fiscal as compared to net income of  or per share in fiscal and  or per share in fiscal certain events occurring in fiscal could have an impact on future results as follows 
the company is conducting part of its research through important collaboration with scientists from the program for the topical prevention of conception and disease topcad based at the rush presbyterian st 
luke s medical center and the university of illinois in chicago 
the company continues to be supported by assistance from the contraceptive research and development program conrad 
during fiscal  conrad and the company received approval to initiate two additional phase i human clinical trials 
the first was a month long  double blind study testing the safety of cellulose sulphate ushercell gel for vaginal use in women 
the results  based on five distinct observations  indicate that ushercell is less irritating than products with similar indications 
the second trial  another double blind study  tested the safety of penile applications of ushercell in men 
after four months  the study concluded that men tolerate ushercell as well as they do other compounds they might encounter during intercourse 
since licensing usherdex to bcy lifesciences inc bcy lifesciences  bcy lifesciences identified usherdex now dcf as its lead drug candidate  completed animal toxicology studies and entered phase i human clinical trials 
during fiscal  the phase i trial came to a successful conclusion with a phase ii trial planned for fiscal in  chemdex  through its vet labs subsidiary  entered into a joint venture the joint venture for the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceutical products with sparhawk laboratories  inc sparhawk 
chemdex owns of the joint venture and controls its board of directors 
the company consolidates the assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses of the joint venture in its financial statements 
the joint venture agreement expires by its terms on december  sparhawk has an option to purchase of the assets held by vet labs for a price equal to of the fair market value of the land  building and equipment owned by vet labs plus  the company is currently in negotiations with sparhawk regarding the future of the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal the company generated cash of  from its operating activities compared to  for fiscal the decrease in earnings in fiscal was the major reason for this decrease in operating cash flow 
in addition  there was a decrease in fiscal in non cash expenses consisting of depreciation  amortization  imputed interest and royalty and interest charged to shareholder 
the company maintained  of working capital and a current ratio of as of january  compared to  of working capital and a current ratio of as of january  at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and  in inventory compared to  and  respectively  at january  the decrease in accounts receivable was due to timing of sales at year end 
dextran products had lower sales in january than january  which decreased the year end receivables balance 
the decrease in inventory levels was due to inventory reductions  primarily at chemdex as management expects sales to continue to be slow until third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures were for production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in both fiscal and the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income is entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment of  in fiscal and  in fiscal arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to us dollars 
dextran products has a cdn  us  line of credit 
management anticipates using the credit line for the purposes of funding a portion of the costs associated with the refurbishment of the toronto facility 
the vet labs sparhawk joint venture has a  line of credit to fund operations 
vet labs has a loan commitment for  to be used for building construction 
management is not planning any construction at vet labs during fiscal during fiscal  the mortgage on the company s toronto facility was paid in full 
management does not expect to borrow against the value of this property during the next fiscal year 
the amount due from shareholder decreased from  at january  to  at january  due to monthly repayments from the shareholder and the netting of royalty payments owed to the shareholder against the outstanding loan 
the amount due to shareholder also decreased during the year to  at january  from  at january  management expects the primary source of its future capital needs to be a combination of company earnings and borrowings 
the company  at present  does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  although management intends to continue the plant refurbishment at dextran products 
no changes in accounting principles or their application have been implemented in the reporting period that would have a material effect on reported income 
changes in the relative values of the canadian dollar and the us dollar occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that the impact of inflation and changing prices on its operations are material 
management objectives management s primary objectives for the coming year are to focus its research and development efforts on ushercell in an effort to enter further clinical trials this year  and to increase sales and profitability 
management s primary objective at chemdex continues to be product development and the marketing of licensed products 
these licensed products require individual approval by the fda and consequently offer greater profit margins 
primary emphasis has been placed on the approval of injectable anada s with secondary emphasis on the approval of solutions and powders
