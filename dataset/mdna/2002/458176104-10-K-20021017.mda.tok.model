internationally  we are represented by over distributors and resellers in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america  and africa 
we continue to face the impact of the recent unfavorable general economic conditions and slow economic recovery  which has resulted in delayed or postponed corporate it spending 
consequently  we have experienced 
table of contents declines in revenue in the last six fiscal quarters 
the reduced revenue was insufficient to absorb our high level of fixed costs  resulting in an increase in net loss specifically during fiscal however  despite adverse market conditions  we have continued to secure new customers  develop and deliver products and services to our customers satisfaction and maintain our financial position  and we continue to have no long term debt 
our current cash and tangible worth per share values and strong current and quick ratios illustrate our financial strength 
in response to the economic slowdown  we implemented initiatives in fiscal and to reduce costs and control spending and we remain committed to reestablishing our top line business growth and improving our financial results 
on june   we announced the appointment woodson hobbs to become our president and chief executive officer upon the departure of president and chief executive officer bradley a

refer to note to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k for more information on the acquisitions 
non recurring events during fiscal and  we announced and executed four major restructuring efforts designed to reduce costs that are not integral to the execution of our overall strategy and to better align our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
for fiscal  our aggregate restructuring charge was approximately  exclusive of  separation costs in connection with the termination of employment of bradley a 
rowe and stephen a 
nicol 
our cost cutting measures during fiscal included a reduction in workforce of approximately in engineering and throughout the organization 
we also consolidated our business facilities located in los gatos and santa cruz  california and nashua  new hampshire with the existing facility located in san jose  california 

table of contents our aggregate restructuring charge for fiscal was approximately  included in our cost reduction initiatives during fiscal was a reduction in workforce representing a total reduction of approximately of our then total workforce 
we also consolidated our business facilities located in california and vacated excess facilities 
during fiscal and  we also determined that certain assets  including intangibles we acquired from dry creek  windward  swifttouch and proxinet  and assets related to our intellisync 
com sm and online operations  were impaired 
we accordingly recorded a total impairment charge of  and  during fiscal and  respectively  to write down or write off the underlying goodwill and identifiable intangibles  related assets held for use or disposal and related commitments 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to our pro rata share of net loss realized by a venture capital fund on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
during fiscal  we also recorded an impairment charge of  for our direct investments in certain privately held companies as such investments were deemed unrecoverable 
refer to the discussions under the caption restructuring and other charges set forth in results of operations below and note to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k for more information on the restructuring and cost reduction plans  and the captions loss on impairment of assets and other than temporary impairment of direct investments set forth in results of operations below and notes and to consolidated financial statements for more information on the impairment charges 
estimates  assumptions and critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon various factors and information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these factors and information may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals 
the estimates  judgments and assumptions we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we use estimates in accounting for  among other things  allowances for uncollectible receivables  returns  inventory obsolescence  fixed asset obsolescence  recoverability of long lived assets and investments  depreciation and amortization  taxes  post contract support  sales incentives  contingencies and various revenue contracts 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following provision for doubtful accounts 
our provision for doubtful accounts relates to customer accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
we specifically analyze customer receivables  as well as analyze the aging of our accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  the financial condition of the customers and their credit worthiness  changes in payment terms  current economic trends  our historical write off experience and other assumptions  when evaluating the adequacy of the provision for doubtful accounts 
if the financial 
table of contents condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the provision for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 
channel inventory and product returns the primary sales channel into which we sell our products is a network of distributors and value added resellers in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america  and africa 
agreements with our distributors and resellers contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products that are generally limited to contractual amounts 
reserves for estimated future returns are provided for upon revenue recognition 
product returns are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
accordingly  we have established a product returns reserve composed of of product inventories held at our distribution partners  as well as an estimated amount for returns from customers of our distributors and other resellers as a result of stock rotation and obsolete products  among others 
we evaluate our product returns reserve on a quarterly basis 
in estimating our product returns reserve  we evaluate the following factors historical product returns and inventory levels on a product by product basis  current inventory levels and sell through data on a product by product basis as reported to us by our major distributors worldwide on a monthly basis  our demand forecast by product in each of our principal geographic markets  which is impacted by our product release schedule  seasonal trends  and analyses developed by our internal sales and marketing group  and general economic conditions 
in general  we would expect product returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and resellers seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and resellers would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of demand 
in assessing the appropriateness of product inventory levels held by our resellers and the impact on potential product returns  we may limit sales to our distributors and resellers in order to maintain inventory levels deemed by management to be appropriate 
we generally estimate and provide product returns reserve based on anticipated level of returns and the criteria noted above 
accordingly  actual product returns may differ from our estimates and may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and consolidated results of operations in future periods due to factors including  but not limited to  market conditions and product release cycles 
valuation of intangibles  investments and other long lived assets 
we have accumulated a significant amount of goodwill  other intangible assets  long term investments and other long lived assets as a result of our investments and acquisitions in prior years 
goodwill represents the unamortized portion of the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and  through july   was amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
identifiable intangible assets result from the application of the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions and are composed of the unamortized identifiable assets including acquired workforce in place  customer contracts  developed technology and core technology 
acquired workforce in place were amortized over the period of benefit  generally months 
customer contracts were amortized over the period of benefit of the respective contracts 
acquired developed and core technology is amortized over the period of benefit  generally three years 

table of contents the ongoing evaluation for impairment of certain identifiable intangibles  investments and long lived assets requires significant management estimation and judgment 
we evaluate the carrying value of these assets for impairment  when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  a new accounting pronouncement  financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill annually beginning in fiscal using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  changes in overall business strategy  negative industry or economic trends  and decline in stock price and market capitalization may trigger an impairment review for certain intangibles 
poor operating results of underlying investments or adverse changes in market conditions may result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of investments 
changes in market value of the assets  physical changes and continuing operating or cash flow losses associated with assets used to generate revenue may suggest problems of recoverability for certain long lived assets 
whenever the evaluation demonstrates that the carrying amount of an intangible  investment or any other long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment charge may be required 
for instance  as a result of the application of the above policy  we determined that certain intangibles we acquired from dry creek  windward  swifttouch and proxinet  as well as certain assets including those related to our intellisync 
com sm and online operations  were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a total impairment charge of  and  during fiscal and  respectively  to write down or write off the underlying goodwill  identifiable intangibles and assets held for use or disposal 
we also recorded a charge in fiscal for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to pumatech s pro rata share of net loss realized by a venture partner on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
in fiscal  we also determined that our direct investments in certain privately held companies were impaired as they were deemed unrecoverable  as a result  we recorded a charge of  for such impairment 
for details on these impairment evaluations and resulting charges  refer to results of operations set forth below 
as of july   our goodwill and other intangibles amounted to  and  net of accumulated amortization  respectively  and our long term investments were  we will cease to amortize our existing goodwill upon our adoption of sfas no 
in the beginning of fiscal we will complete the amortization of other existing intangibles with a total charge of approximately  by the end of fiscal however  to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investment in goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to earlier write off 
also  with the recent decline in our market capitalization and other factors affecting our industry  the application of the methodology within sfas no 
may result in the write off of a portion or full amount of our goodwill 
restructuring accruals 
during fiscal and  we implemented cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to continued negotiations with landlords or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 

table of contents during fiscal  we recorded facilities costs related to a vacated facility in emeryville  california  and a vacated section of an office space in santa cruz  california  of approximately  and  respectively 
we have experienced difficulties in subletting these offices because of the continuing deterioration of the real estate market in these locations 
as a result  we determined that additional charges were needed for the full amount of rent for the emeryville office throughout the term of the lease agreement 
further charges were also needed for the santa cruz facility for adjustments in expected sublease rates and brokerage fees  as well as for costs associated with its remaining office space recently vacated as a result of a further reduction in workforce 
the aggregate charges recorded during fiscal were approximately  and  for the emeryville and santa cruz facilities  respectively 
during fiscal  we also recorded facilities costs of approximately  related to a recently vacated facility in nashua  new hampshire 
actual results may differ significantly from this estimate if any of the factors affecting our assumptions were to change in the future 
license and service revenue recognition 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation or integration exist  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
arrangements for which the fees are not deemed probable for collection are recognized upon cash collection 
arrangements for which the fees are not deemed fixed or determinable are recognized in the period they become due 
if we were to assess the collectibility of fees differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from previously estimated or reported 
services revenue primarily comprises revenue from consulting fees  maintenance contracts and training 
services revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the service is performed 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades and ongoing support 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis as services revenue over the life of the related contract 
if we were to allocate more or less value to the unspecified upgrades and ongoing support  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously reported 
for contracts with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements exists  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by the american institute of certified public accountants in statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we have accumulated relevant information from contracts to use in determining the availability of vendor specific objective evidence and believe that such information complies with the criteria established in sop no 
 software revenue recognition which provides guidance on generally accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions 
if we were to allocate the respective fair values of the aforementioned elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
license and service revenue associated with contracts that involve significant implementation of customization of services  which are essential to the functionality of the software  is recognized over the period of each engagement primarily using the percentage of completion method 
labor hours incurred is generally used as the measure of progress towards completion as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts 
revenue for these arrangements is classified as license revenue and service revenue based upon estimates of fair value of each element  and the revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion ratio for the arrangement 
recognized revenue is subject to revisions as the engagement progresses to completion 
revisions in estimates or estimated losses on engagements are made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
considerable judgment  such as the scope of work and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some tasks  may be required in determining estimates to complete an engagement 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the total amount of work required to complete the engagement  the timing of our revenue 
table of contents recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
we consider a project completed at the go live date 
when we sell additional licenses  we recognize revenue after the go live date if the products or seats have been delivered and no remaining obligations exist 
we also have other key accounting policies which we believe either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
also refer to the discussion in note to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item  below under the caption the company and a summary of its significant accounting policies  for more information on other significant accounting policies

table of contents revenue 
we derive revenue from two primary sources software licenses and fees for service 
revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal revenue decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal resulted mainly from the general economic slowdown and its impact on our customers  many of whom have reduced their it spending or ceased their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
the decline in our revenue also resulted from a general slowdown in sales of palm os based handhelds and other personal digital assistant pda devices  as well as delays in our new product introductions 
our revenue growth in fiscal resulted an increase in the number of licensing arrangements we entered into and the creation of our professional services group in that year 
license revenue 
license revenue is earned from the sale and use of software products including our technology licensing components and royalty agreements with oems 
license revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in license revenue in fiscal reflected a decrease in revenue of  from our enterprise products which include both personal and server based intellisync and satellite forms products   from our technology licensing components  and  from our legacy personal computers pc or notebooks business intellisync for notebooks royalty revenue 
the increase in license revenues in fiscal reflected an increase of  in revenues of technology licensing components and  in revenues of enterprise products 
this increase was offset by  decrease in revenue received for our legacy notebook business the intellisync for notebook royalty revenue 
revenue from our enterprise products increased due to the market s continued widespread adoption of our enterprise product offerings 
revenue from technology licensing components increased due to an increase in the number of licensing arrangements we entered into particularly during the first three quarters of fiscal notebook revenue decreased in both years as its revenue stream has matured and as we continue to deemphasize the resources and effort associated with this revenue segment 
accordingly  we expect that our legacy notebook business revenue in subsequent quarters will be significantly lower or decrease to an insignificant amount 
as part of our consolidation of our product lines  we have eliminated our online service offerings 
as a result of the discontinuation of these services  we expect that revenue from our technology licensing components will continue to decrease in subsequent quarters 
service revenue 
service revenue is derived from fees for services  including time and materials for professional services  non recurring engineering service projects for software development  amortization of maintenance contract programs  hosting and advertising fees 
service revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in service revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in professional service revenue of  associated with our technology licensing partners  many of whom have been affected by a continued weak it spending environment 
revenue from maintenance  hosting and advertising fees also decreased for the most recent fiscal year by an aggregate amount of  the increase in service revenue in fiscal was brought about by the creation of our professional services group with the acquisitions of dry creek and windward 
professional service revenue in fiscal increased by  the increase in fiscal was also due to an increase of  in maintenance contract programs which was primarily the result of the increase in licensing activity 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in advertising fees and decrease of  in non recurring engineering service projects revenue 
oem revenue in fiscal was  or of total revenue  compared with  or of total revenue in fiscal and  or of total revenue in fiscal oem revenue decreased in absolute terms in fiscal primarily due to a decline in revenue of  from intellisync for 
table of contents notebooks royalties and  from platform licensing of the intellisync sdks 
this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in revenue of  from our server based products 
the increase in oem revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a greater decline in revenue of  from personal enterprise products  professional services and other technology licensing components 
the decrease in oem revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the decline of  in intellisync for notebook royalty revenue and  in server based products  partially offset by an increase of  in licensing of intellisync sdk 
although several oem agreements contain contractual minimum purchase obligations  there can be no assurance that any particular oem will satisfy such obligation 
in addition  we believe that the percentage of revenue derived from oems may fluctuate in future periods since the use of distribution channels in the united states and internationally for our existing and future products is subject to change  causing our revenue to be difficult to forecast 
further  we expect the notebook related oem portion of this revenue to continue to decrease to an insignificant amount in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall revenue in subsequent years 
international revenue continues to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
international revenue in fiscal was  or of total revenue  compared with  or of total revenue in fiscal and  or of total revenue in fiscal for fiscal  the revenue gains in europe and certain parts of asia  which resulted directly from our international direct sales force expansion in fiscal  were more than offset by a decrease in revenue in japan resulting from a general economic slowdown and an overall reduction in technology spending in that country 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue  however  was due to a decline in our overall revenue 
for fiscal  our international revenue in absolute terms increased due to our continued efforts in that year to expand our international presence and sales efforts 
this increase was partially offset by lower international notebook and pc oem royalties 
the decrease of international revenue as a percentage of total revenue reflected the considerable increase in our united states revenue 
international revenue may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in operations in the united states  including exposure to tariffs  various trade regulations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  as well as international software piracy 
we believe that continued growth would require further expansion in international markets 
we have utilized and may continue to utilize substantial resources to expand existing and establish additional international operations in the future 
also  refer to other relevant risks and uncertainties associated with international revenue set forth in part i  item under the caption business risks in this annual report on form k 
one distributor  ingram micro us  accounted for  and of our total revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  the revenue from ingram micro us  represents revenue recognized at the time our products were sold to customers by ingram micro 
deferred revenue was  and  at july  and  respectively 
the decrease in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in number of technology licensing customers  many of whom were forced to close their operations or unable to meet their contractual obligations as a result of the economic downturn  and  to a lesser extent  due to new licensing deals that were not structured with guaranteed commitments 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists of license costs and service costs 
license costs comprise product packaging expenses such as product media and duplication  manuals  packing supplies  and shipping costs 
service costs comprise personnel related expenses such as salaries and other related costs including non cash stock compensation associated with work performed under professional service contracts  non recurring engineering agreements and hosting costs for online services associated with technology licensing partners and end users  and post sales customer support costs 
hosting costs include expenses related to bandwidth for hosting  tape backup  security and storage  third party fees and internal personnel costs associated with logistics and operational support of the hosting services and depreciation of computer equipment associated with the hosting service 
service costs can be expected to vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide 

table of contents in general  license costs represent a far smaller percentage of license revenue than service costs  which have a much higher cost structure as a percentage of service revenue 
additionally  license costs tend to be variable based on license revenue volumes  whereas service costs tend to be fixed within certain service revenue volume ranges 
we would expect that an increase in service revenue as a percentage of our total revenue would generate lower overall gross margins as a percentage of total revenue 
also  given the high level of fixed costs associated with the professional services group  our inability to generate revenue sufficient to absorb these fixed costs could lead to negative service gross margins 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue was  or of license revenue   or of license revenue  and  or of license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted from reduced variable packaged product costs associated with reduced license volumes 
the decrease in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of license revenue in fiscal primarily reflects efficiencies realized from higher license revenue volumes 
in general  fluctuations in cost of license revenue are primarily the result of varying levels of royalties paid  changes in product mix and the timing of large license sales 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue was  or of service revenue   or of service revenue  and  or of service revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in professional services costs as a result of workforce reductions we implemented in fiscal  as well as overall reduction in our service revenues 
the increase in cost of service revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenue in fiscal reflects an increase in service revenue  increased headcount in our online services and professional services groups and hosting costs associated with our online service offerings 
the gross margin loss in fiscal and was largely due to a high level of fixed costs  primarily personnel related expenses  associated with our professional services group that had experienced higher but insufficient revenue to absorb their fully burdened costs 
we expect our gross profit margin percentage to range between about in the next two quarters as compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
this range is primarily driven by our expectation for different margin characteristics within and between license and service revenues as well as the expected mix between product and channels 
in addition  our fixed cost elements are expected to be substantially reduced as a result of discontinuing our online service business 
we expect our overall operating expenses for the first half of will decline as compared with the previous quarters in fiscal primarily as a result of reduced workforce coinciding with our various business restructurings  reduced facilities costs as a result of consolidating facilities  and reduced infrastructure costs and discretionary spending 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash stock compensation for research and development personnel  quality assurance personnel  product localization  fees to outside contractors and the cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment 
we invest in research and development both for new products and to provide continuing enhancements to existing products 
research and development expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  research and development expenses increased by to  from  in fiscal research and development represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute research and development spending in fiscal was primarily due to the elimination of the intellisync 
com sm online service and our re emphasis on core product development  as part of the cost control initiatives we implemented in fiscal and  which in turn resulted in a decrease in personnel and contractor related costs of approximately  and other costs of approximately  net of contract costs associated with ramping up our offshore development resources 
this decrease was slightly offset by a write off of certain excess software development tools of  and completion bonuses of  paid to certain employees affected by 
table of contents restructuring in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses increased due to overall revenue decline in fiscal the increase in absolute research and development spending in fiscal was primarily due to increased personnel that we acquired in connection with our prior year acquisitions  planned higher spending for the development and maintenance of our technology licensing components  and increased costs associated with preparing for the production launch of intellisync 
com at the time 
as previously mentioned  we are consolidating our software product lines to focus on developing and selling mobile computing solutions geared to enterprise customers 
we also have eliminated our online service offerings which incorporated our service oriented intellectual property sync it  mind it and browse it 
although we expect to use a reasonable amount of our research and development resources for our new strategies  we do not anticipate an increase in related costs in aggregate due to our recent restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
as a result  we expect our quarterly research and development costs to decrease for the first half of fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  promotional expenses and other related costs including non cash stock compensation relating to sales and marketing employees  as well as to technical support personnel associated with pre sales activities such as building brand awareness  performing product and technical presentations and answering customers product and service inquiries 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased to  from  in fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in absolute terms in fiscal due to reduction in salaries and other personnel related costs of  as a result of headcount reductions  reduction in bonus and commissions of  as a result of lower revenue  and reduction in corporate marketing resources  corporate branding initiatives and other related costs of  as a result of lower planned spending 
sales and marketing expenses  however  increased as a percentage of total revenue due to overall revenue decline in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales personnel to expand our united states and international sales and business development organizations  and an increase in corporate marketing resources  corporate branding and marketing headcount for our online services group 
as compared with the sales and marketing costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales and marketing expenses over the next two quarters are expected to slightly increase quarterly or remain relatively flat in absolute dollars as we attempt to establish strategic relationships with our existing and prospective enterprise customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash stock compensation relating to administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  in fiscal general and administrative expenses represented approximately  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute general and administrative spending was primarily due to a reduction in provision for bad debts allowance of  and a reduction in personnel related costs of  as a result of our recent restructurings  as well as in other related costs of  as a result of lower planned spending 
this decrease was slightly offset by a provision recorded for rent reimbursement deemed uncollectible of  relating to the windward acquisition  as well as signing bonus of  for our new president and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses  however  increased as a percentage of total revenue due to overall decline in revenue 
the increase in absolute general and administrative spending in fiscal was primarily due to an increased provision for bad debts allowance and  to a much lesser extent  the addition of personnel and increased fees for professional services  such as legal  accounting  and other consulting services  to support the expansion of our infrastructure during the first part of fiscal  and the consolidation and assimilation of the windward and swifttouch assets 
the decrease in general and administrative spending as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal reflects an increase in revenue 
we expect our quarterly general and administrative expenses for the first 
table of contents half of fiscal to decrease or remain at a lower absolute level similar to those of the recent previous quarters as a result of our recent restructurings and cost reduction initiatives 
the expected decrease would slightly be offset by anticipated legal costs associated with our patent infringement lawsuit 
purchased in process research and development 
we expensed purchased in process research and development costs of  as a result of the proxinet acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal the proxinet acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total purchase price of approximately  including liabilities of  was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including  to tangible assets acquired   to identified intangible assets   to in process research and development  and  to goodwill 
the in process research and development was expensed at the acquisition date 
the value assigned to this acquired in process research and development was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date 
these include projects for proxiware and proxiweb technology 
the value was determined by estimating the revenue contribution and the percentage of completion of each of these projects 
the projects were deemed to be complete on the date of acquisition 
the net cash flows were then discounted utilizing a weighted average cost of capital of  which  among other related assumptions  we believed to be fairly accurate 
this discount rate takes into consideration the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  the expected profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates described above 
at the acquisition date  revenues were projected to be generated in fiscal for the products in development 
the projects for proxiware and proxiweb technology  branded as the browse it product  were completed  as expected  in the fourth quarter of fiscal browse it started generating revenue but at a level substantially lower than what we originally expected 
we accordingly performed an evaluation of the existing goodwill and purchased intangibles related to the proxinet acquisition and determined that the underlying assets were impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  and  for goodwill and developed technology  respectively  in fiscal for more details on the evaluation of the proxinet intangibles and resulting impairment charge  refer to the discussion set forth below under the caption loss on impairment of assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
regular amortization of acquired goodwill decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  amortization of goodwill increased to  from  in fiscal regular amortization of other intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  amortization of other intangible assets increased to  from  in fiscal the decrease in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal reflects the effect of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which significantly reduced the carrying value of our existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal resulted from our acquisitions of swifttouch and windward in fiscal and dry creek and proxinet in fiscal we will cease to amortize our existing goodwill upon our adoption of sfas no 
in the beginning of fiscal however  with the recent decline in our market capitalization and other factors affecting our industry  the application of the methodology within sfas no 
may result in the write off of a portion or full amount of our remaining goodwill 
we will complete the amortization of other existing intangible assets with a total charge of approximately million by the end of fiscal  based on acquisitions completed as of july  refer to the discussion set forth below under the caption recently issued accounting pronouncements for more information on the new accounting for goodwill 

table of contents we also recorded a charge for impairment of certain intangibles in fiscal and as discussed under the caption loss on impairment of assets set forth below 
non cash stock compensation 
non cash stock compensation  included in each appropriate operating expense category of our consolidated statements of operations  relates to stock options that were deemed to have been granted at a price below market value  as well as to certain options that are subject to variable plan accounting 
the non cash stock compensation charge  net of the effect of terminations  aggregated   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of the non cash stock compensation expense for all fiscal years presented relates to options granted by netmind prior to our acquisition of netmind 
these charges are amortized over the vesting period of the options 
our stock compensation also reflects the effect of certain stock options accounted for using variable accounting 
based on the stock price of pumatech s common stock at july   the aggregate non cash stock compensation in fiscal and is expected to be approximately  and  respectively 
other income expense 
other income expense  net  represents interest earned on cash and short term investments and realized gains on miscellaneous investments  offset by interest expense on debt and miscellaneous bank fees and charges 
total other income  net  was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in total other income  net  in fiscal reflects a decrease in the rate of interest on reduced balances of cash and investments  offset by  decrease in a charge recorded for an other than temporary impairment of investments as described below 
the decrease in total other income  net  in fiscal reflects a decrease in rate of interest on reduced balances of cash and investments  as well as a loss of  realized from the sale of pg e commercial paper 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to our pro rata share of net loss realized by a venture capital fund on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges aggregating  for our direct investments in yadayada  inc  if then  inc  and pulsemd corporation that we deemed unrecoverable 
these investments were fully impaired due to changes in these entities capital structure impacting our investment preferences  thin capitalization  dilution due to dramatic declines in valuations and overall lack of persuasive evidence that would indicate a future ability or intent of these entities that would support the carrying value of our investments 
we expect other income expense  net  over the first half of fiscal  to remain flat as compared to that of recent previous quarters 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes primarily represents foreign withholding taxes on royalties earned from certain foreign customers and  to a lesser extent  estimated taxes for foreign subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect provision for income taxes to be about  quarterly over the first half of fiscal accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock to redemption value 
during fiscal  netmind issued approximately million shares of series b preferred stock which converted into approximately million shares of pumatech s common stock upon completion of the netmind merger in february under the terms of the original issuance  the series b shares were redeemable in september and  at the higher of their original issue price or the fair value of the stock at the dates of redemption 
the difference between the issuance price and the fair value of the series b stock was accreted by netmind 
such accretion aggregated to  in fiscal non recurring charges merger costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred one time costs totaling  associated with the acquisition of netmind 
these costs included direct transaction costs primarily for financial advisory service and professional service costs associated with the merger 

table of contents restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges consist of the following year ended july  restructuring charges severance costs facilities costs assets held for disposal other charges total restructuring charges separation costs restructuring and other charges restructuring charges during fiscal and  we implemented a number of cost reduction plans aimed at reducing costs that were not integral to our overall strategy and to better align our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending during periods of economic uncertainty 
fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we announced and implemented cost reduction initiatives in our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses and preserve our cash reserves 
as part of the restructuring programs  we implemented a reduction in our engineering workforce of approximately employees while we increased our offshore engineering capacity by utilizing a number of european software development partners to perform certain product engineering related projects and meet other engineering requirements that may arise 
this reduction in engineering workforce  as well as the additional positions eliminated in other business functions  brought the number of our worldwide full time equivalent employees  excluding significant contracted offshore development resources  down to approximately at july  the program was completed by the end of july  and the associated severance costs incurred were approximately   of which remained unused as of july  we also further consolidated our business facilities located in los gatos  california and nashua  new hampshire with our corporate headquarters located in san jose  california 
the costs of consolidating facilities include  for excess facility lease and vacancy costs and  for write off of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  office equipment and furniture and fixtures  to be taken out of service 
the unused balance as of july  was  we continually evaluate the balance of the restructuring reserve we recorded in prior years based on the remaining estimated amounts to be paid 
during fiscal  we recorded facilities costs related to a vacated facility in emeryville  california  and a vacated section of an office space in santa cruz  california  of approximately  and  respectively 
as a result of difficulties in subletting these offices because of the continuing deterioration of the real estate market in these locations  we determined that additional charges were needed for the full amount of rent for the emeryville office throughout the term of the lease agreement 
further charges were also needed for the santa cruz facility for adjustments in expected sublease rates and brokerage fees  as well as for costs associated with its remaining office space recently vacated as a result of a further reduction in workforce 
the aggregate charges recorded during fiscal were approximately  and  for emeryville and santa cruz facilities  respectively 
the unused balance as of july  was fiscal our primary cost reduction initiatives in fiscal included a reduction in workforce and facilities consolidation 
affecting mostly those holding positions in engineering and 
table of contents professional services  the workforce reduction  which was completed during july  represented a reduction of approximately of our then total workforce or approximately full time equivalent positions including contractors and permanent employees 
this reduction in force was completed at the end of july the associated severance costs incurred were approximately  none of which remained unused as of july  we also incurred additional restructuring charges aggregating  for consolidating facilities with space located in santa cruz  california and nashua  new hampshire 
the costs of consolidating facilities includes  for excess facility lease and vacancy costs and  for write off of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer and engineering equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures  to be taken out of service 
the unused balance as of july  was  as discussed above  an adjustment to restructuring charges was made for santa cruz facility in fiscal a summary of the severance and facilities costs and assets held for disposal relating to the cost reduction plans implemented is outlined as follows in thousands workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities other total balance at july  restructuring provision non cash charges cash payments balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment non cash charges cash payments balance at july  amounts related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of excess facilities are paid over the respective lease terms through may using cash from operations 
as of july   the aggregate remaining restructuring accrual of  includes the unused balance of  from fiscal restructuring charges relating to future lease obligations for certain excess facilities through december the remaining lease payments on all the excess facilities as of july   were approximately  net of proceeds from outstanding sublease agreements 
we have further reduced the total costs of excess facilities by the estimated proceeds from assumed future subleases 
if the actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to adjust our facilities costs accrual related to expected losses on subleases  including recording additional losses 
differences  if any  between the estimated amounts accrued and the actual amounts paid will be reflected in operating expenses in future period 
separation costs in fiscal  we recorded accruals of approximately  related to separation agreements with our former president and chief executive officer and former executive vice president of sales and business development 
in accordance with the agreements  the accrued amounts are being paid over the month period following the officers termination 
the unused balance as of july   was approximately  
table of contents loss on impairment of assets 
loss on impairment of assets consists of the following year ended july  intangibles commitment assets held and used assets held for disposal loss on impairment of assets during fiscal and  we determined that certain intangible assets we acquired  certain assets used exclusively for our online operations and intellisync 
com were impaired 
therefore  we recorded impairment charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  to write down or write off goodwill and certain intangibles in connection with the proxinet  dry creek  windward and swifttouch acquisitions  and other assets  as well as a related commitment  we believe will not bring a viable business opportunity for us in the future 
proxinet we purchased proxinet in the first quarter of fiscal in anticipation of broadening the appeal of internet connected wireless devices and other internet appliances through the use of proxinet s core technology  proxiware and proxiweb  later branded as the browse it product 
by combining pumatech s intellisync platform with this highly scalable proxy based transformation and delivery architecture  major internet destinations such as portals  search engines and e commerce companies would have the means to provide highly secure  real time access to users of handheld devices  cellular phones and other devices and internet appliances 
we expected that users would be able to browse information online  while simultaneously retrieving and synchronizing critical information while offline 
at the time the proxinet s acquisition was consummated  we planned to market browse it primarily to major internet companies such as portals and e commerce sites as well as cellular carriers and other wireless providers 
browse it started generating revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but at a level substantially lower than what we originally expected average quarterly revenue for fiscal was approximately  in addition  due to general economic slowdowns  several of our browse it customers  many of which are internet companies  reduced their it spending or ceased their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
consequently  revenue from browse it continued to deteriorate  decreasing as low as  by the fourth quarter of fiscal these factors demonstrated that browse it product would not bring sufficient revenue to absorb high related costs 
by the end of fiscal  as part of our plan to refocus our business strategies  we decided to discontinue our browse it technology offerings 
related employees were either terminated or reassigned to other engineering functions 
furthermore  we determined that browse it technology has no alternative uses and had not been incorporated into other products or services  and  accordingly  recorded in fiscal an impairment write off of  and  related to the net book value of goodwill and developed technology  respectively  from the proxinet acquisition 
dry creek and windward we purchased dry creek and windward in the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal  respectively  in anticipation of several benefits from the acquisitions  including dry creek would serve as the core of our professional services offerings  windward would expand the professional services group and become a turnkey vendor providing top tier customers with customized solutions substantially based on our technology licensing components  
table of contents the acquisitions would enable us to accelerate deployment of our technology licensing components with existing and targeted customers  the acquisition would provide us with a pool of talented and highly skilled employees  approximately employees were hired from both acquisitions  dry creek s developed and core technology 
at the time the acquisitions were completed  we had experienced sequential growth in quarterly revenue from our technology licensing components 
from  for the first quarter of fiscal  our technology license revenue increased for the same period in fiscal by to  from the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal  cost of revenue was in the range of to of total revenue 
at the time the acquisitions were consummated  we anticipated continued growth and increased gross margin contribution due to increased capacity acquired from our increased professional services workforce 
however  the general economic slowdown in calendar year and to date in caused a number of our existing and potential customers to reduce their it spending or cease their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
additionally  many of our technology licensing customers closed their operations or were unable to meet their contractual obligations leaving us with a smaller install base of customers across which to deploy our professional service team 
because of these and other factors  our technology licensing revenue decreased during the second quarter of fiscal to  remained relatively flat in the third quarter at  and decreased during the fourth quarter to  compared with technology licensing revenue in the first quarter 
revenue from our professional services  which facilitate our technology licensing components  for the same periods was   and  respectively  which was significantly lower than our expectations 
in addition  cost of revenue for those periods of  and  respectively  of total revenue were significantly higher than those in recent previous quarters given the high level of related fixed costs  in particular personnel related costs  and revenues insufficient to absorb these costs 
to better align our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending  we implemented cost reduction plans in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal the first plan  as well as employees transfers and resignations  decreased the number of employees in the professional services group to by the end of the third quarter of fiscal the second plan resulted in a further reduction in our workforce bringing down the number of employees in the professional services group to by july  the aforementioned factors led us to believe that the goodwill and intangibles acquired from dry creek and windward were impaired 
accordingly  we assessed the recoverability of the related long lived assets and  as a result  recorded an impairment write down of goodwill of  in fiscal the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the professional services group 
the assumptions supporting the future cash flows  including the discount rate of  were determined using our best estimates 
the discount rate was determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
we continue to monitor the operations of our professional services group  its trend of revenue growth or decline  all associated costs  and its overall contribution to our profitability  as well as any events or indicators that the carrying amount of the remaining goodwill and intangibles might not be recoverable 
swifttouch we purchased certain technology assets from swifttouch in the second quarter of fiscal in anticipation of increasing our revenue and accelerating our return to profitability through the use of swifttouch developed technology for our intellisync 
com online service offering 
we believed this technology would extend the capabilities of our intellisync 
com service bureau by providing potential subscribers with access to various information via wap wireless application protocol enabled phones 
table of contents or by voice 
it would deliver powerful collaborative features that automatically update calendar and contact information among groups of users  while also giving us a viral marketing tool for minimizing user acquisition costs as we attempted to build the intellisync 
com subscriber base 
at the time the swifttouch acquisition was consummated  we planned to host our technology licensing components for the public through our intellisync 
com web service within the first half of calendar year in march  we introduced intellisync 
com to the public and offered its available service options free of charge during the initial introductory period 
we anticipated that several thousands users would adopt intellisync 
com and that we would derive a significant portion of our future revenue from offering fee based services beginning in the spring of by the end of the first half of calendar year  we realized that successful customer adoption of and monetization from several fee based online service offerings such as our intellisync 
com offerings were slow and limited 
additionally  deployment and usage of mobile wireless devices had fallen short of our expectations 
these factors  as well as changes in general economic and market conditions  led us to believe that if intellisync 
com were to continue  the costs associated with its operation would have a further negative impact on our results of operations in the near future 
by the end of fiscal  as a result of the events described above  we decided that intellisync 
com should be suspended indefinitely and determined that technology acquired from swifttouch used exclusively for intellisync 
com was impaired 
accordingly  an impairment write down of  related to the net book value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles from the swifttouch acquisition was recorded in fiscal other impaired assets the recent plan to focus effort on our core business necessitated a thorough review of certain operations and related assets that we believe will not be viable to integrate into our new strategies 
our new plan provided for no further support for online operations  as well as terminating the use and maintenance of excess related assets 
during fiscal  in our review of our online operations and related assets  such as computers  servers  network and other hosting related equipment  we specifically identified those assets that would be held for use to finish preexisting contracts with certain customers for a short period of time  after which the assets will be disposed of or abandoned 
we also identified the related assets that would be held for immediate disposal 
based on a recoverability analysis we performed of the assets carrying value  we have anticipated no further cash flows from the online operations 
we  therefore  recorded an impairment charge of  and  for assets held for use and assets held for disposal  respectively  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeded the recovery value less disposal costs 
we determined the recovery value of the assets using our best estimates on market prices of similar assets 
in addition  we have written off related hosting commitment with a third party vendor  a related party  for its entire value  totaling  with respect to the indefinite suspension of intellisync 
com described above  we identified certain assets related to intellisync 
com that we would no longer use 
we  therefore  classified these assets as held for disposal and revised their carrying value from book value to recovery value less disposal costs resulting in a  impairment charge in fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the accounting for a business combination at the date a business combination is completed 
specifically  it requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling 
table of contents of interests method 
sfas no 
establishes new guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
among other things  it requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized  and that they be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
we will cease to amortize our existing goodwill upon our adoption of the goodwill non amortization provisions  among others  of this statement at the beginning of fiscal we currently estimate that the non amortization of goodwill will result in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately  for fiscal year based on acquisitions completed as of july  further  sfas no 
requires us to perform a transitional assessment of whether there is an indication that our goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
we will then have a transition period of six months from the date of adoption to determine if the goodwill has been impaired 
the impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting unit to the carrying value  including goodwill of the unit 
if the unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds its fair value  we will move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
any goodwill impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle no later than the end of the initial fiscal year of adoption 
we expect to complete the impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal with the recent decline in our market capitalization and other factors affecting our industry  the application of the methodology within sfas no 
may result in the write off of a portion or full amount of our remaining goodwill 
we will also be required to review our other intangible assets for impairment and to reassess the useful lives of such assets and make any necessary adjustments 
we have not yet determined what further effect these impairment tests will have on our earnings and financial position

accounting for exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
we will adopt sfas no 
during the second quarter of fiscal the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the effect on adoption of sfas no 
will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations or financial position

the change in working capital items in fiscal reflected an increase in accrued liabilities of  and a decrease in accounts receivable  other current assets  inventory and other assets and liabilities of    and  respectively  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and deferred revenue of  and  respectively 
these changes in working capital items in fiscal resulted mainly from recent restructuring accruals  reduced revenue and increased emphasis on cash collections and costs reduction 
in fiscal  the change in working capital items reflected an 
table of contents increase in accounts receivable of  deferred revenue of  accounts payable of  other current assets of  and net change in other assets and liabilities of  related to increased business volumes and contracts signed during the year 
our negative operating cash flows primarily reflect our net losses resulting generally from the same factors affecting our revenues and expenses as described above 
we made significant changes to our operating structure  including the consolidation of facilities and the reduction of workforce  over the last two fiscal years 
we believe that these efforts have and will continue to reduce costs  control spending and decrease our operating expenses and align us with our commitment to improve our operating cash flows and overall financial results

table of contents we also have full recourse loans outstanding to various officers totaling  exclusive of accrued interest  as of july  the loans carry an interest rate between and  and repayments are due through we received principal payments of  on the loans in the first quarter of fiscal refer to the discussions in notes and to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k for more details 
restricted cash and lines of credit we have restricted cash held by two financial institutions as collateral on letters of credit in connection with our lease of office spaces 
at july   the restricted cash amounted to  of which  is included in other current assets 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank under which we can borrow up to  the loan and security agreement originally expired in march but was renewed with a due date of september borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate or libor as selected by pumatech and are collateralized by cash deposits  receivables  inventories  equipment  and intangibles 
principal is due at expiration  and interest payments are generally due monthly 
the loan and security agreement contains covenants requiring that we maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and meet a certain quick ratio 
the agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants including but not limited to limitations on indebtedness  limitations on dividends and other restrictions on payments including repurchases of our common stock  limitations on transactions with affiliates  limitations on liens  limitations on disposition of proceeds of asset sales  and limitations on investments and mergers  among others 
as of july   we were in compliance with the loan covenants 
the  outstanding as of july   under the agreement was fully paid off in september we maintained another loan and security agreement in a prior year that provided a  revolving credit line and a  equipment line 
the outstanding balance of  at july  on a  equipment line of credit was paid off in september with a portion of the new borrowings described above 
the  equipment line and a  revolving line of credit were not renewed 
commitments the following table sets forth future payments due under our debt and lease obligations as of july  in thousands year ending july  total line of credit operating leases minimum proceeds from sublease total we are also committed to invest an additional  in azure venture partners 
the total of future actual investments may be less than this amount  depending on future performance of the investee companies 
these funds are expected to be paid contractually as requested by the general partners over a period not to exceed the contract term of eight years 
we believe that the remainder of the funds will be paid over the next three fiscal years 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  including the credit lines and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  to be used principally for various systems upgrades 

table of contents in the future  we may seek to raise cash through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us at all  or on terms favorable to us  due to  among other things  high volatility of our stock price 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies  including ours  due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  such as quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general market conditions  as well as delisting from the nasdaq national market 
we received recently a letter from nasdaq stating that our common stock is subject to delisting 
although we appealed the decision and are awaiting the hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel  there can be no assurances that the appeal would be resolved favorably 
the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq may result in a reduction in the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing for our operations 
we therefore are currently considering all of the options available to us to assist us in our efforts to maintain our listing on nasdaq including effecting a reverse stock split 
accordingly  our proxy statement for annual meeting of stockholders will include a proposal for an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of pumatech s common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and market values of our investments which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
interest rate risk at july   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale  of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   the decline of the fair value of the portfolio would be immaterial 
other than certain government securities  most of our fixed income investments have maturities of less than one year 
while we intend to hold our fixed income investments until maturity to avoid recognizing an adverse impact in income or cash flows in the event of an increase in market interest rates  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
the table below presents the carrying value  which approximates fair value  and related weighted average coupon interest rates for the our investment portfolio at july  in thousands  except interest rates 
carrying amount average coupon interest rate cash equivalents short term investments total portfolio foreign currency risk to date  the majority of our recognized revenue has been denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that more product and service revenue may be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market in the future 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
we will also be exposed to increased risk of non payment by our customers in foreign countries  especially those of highly inflationary economies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products and services less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be assured that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
we may continue to expand internationally in the future and become increasingly subject to other risks of doing business internationally including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary are translated into united states dollar in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
to date  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial statements has been immaterial 

table of contents other investment risk we are a limited partner in a venture capital fund  through which we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investment in this venture capital fund is included in other assets and is accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
at july   this investment amounted to  refer to note to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k for more details 
for such investment  we regularly review the operating performance of the fund in assessing the carrying value 
we identify and record an impairment loss when events and circumstances indicate that such asset might be impaired 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to our pro rata share of net loss realized by a venture capital fund on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
although we will continue to assess the carrying values of our investments  we cannot be assured that a decline in value of our current and future investments will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
furthermore  given the recent unfavorable economic conditions and the effect of economic slowdown on the capital markets  we cannot be assured that any other investments we have can be fully recouped  if at all
