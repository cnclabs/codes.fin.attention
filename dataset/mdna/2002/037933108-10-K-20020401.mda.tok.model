item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through approximately branch locations 
strategy 
apria is pursuing an operating strategy to increase market share and improve profitability 
key elements of the strategy are as follows remain in its core businesses of home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment 
offering a comprehensive range of services gives apria a competitive advantage with its core managed care customers and enables it to maintain a diversified revenue base 
however  apria plans on increasing the percentage of net revenues generated by home respiratory therapy  which historically has produced higher gross margins than its home infusion therapy and home medical equipment service lines 
continue to expand through internal growth in the home respiratory service line and through acquisitions 
apria operates in a highly fragmented market  which provides an attractive opportunity to drive growth through acquisitions 
standardize procedures  reduce costs  enhance margins and optimize cash flow by implementing best practices programs throughout the company 
apria s receivables management program has reduced days sales outstanding to at december  additionally  apria has developed and implemented standardized clinical and delivery models  billing practices and common operating procedures in its field locations and has centralized purchasing for inventory  patient service equipment and supplies 
apria continues to focus resources on identifying opportunities for further productivity improvements 
critical accounting policies 
apria s management considers the accounting policies that govern revenue recognition and the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable to be the most critical in relation to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies require management s most complex and subjective judgments 
other accounting policies requiring significant judgment are those related to goodwill and income taxes 
revenue and accounts receivable 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received  although services were provided and revenue was earned 
management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure that recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
management applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable aging to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age  accounts aged in excess of days are reserved at 
management establishes and monitors these percentages through extensive analyses of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as govenmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures and system changes 
if indicated by such analyses  management may periodically adjust the uncollectible estimate and corresponding percentages 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed to determine if additional reserves are required 
because of the reimbursement environment in which apria operates and the level of subjectivity that is required in recording revenues and accounts receivable  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
prior to a transition period called for by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill was being amortized over the period of expected benefit 
management reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated the possibility of impairment 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
income taxes 
apria provides for income taxes in accordance with provisions specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future  based on tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
segment reporting 
apria s branch locations are organized into geographic regions 
each region consists of a number of branches and a regional office which provides key support services such as billing  purchasing  equipment maintenance  repair and warehousing 
management evaluates operating results on a geographic basis  and therefore views each region as an operating segment 
all regions provide the same products and services  including respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment and supplies 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria in paragraph of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
recent accounting pronouncements 
during the first quarter of  apria adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for hedging activities and for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on apria s consolidated financial statements 
see long term debt hedging activities 
in july  apria adopted sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  are accounted for under the purchase method and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on apria s consolidated financial statements 
effective january   apria adopted sfas no 
 in its entirety 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement provides that goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
the impairment test is comprised of two steps a reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value  if the fair value is less than its carrying value  goodwill impairment is indicated  and if impairment is indicated in the first step  it is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value at the reporting unit level 
in the year of adoption  sfas no 
requires a transitional goodwill impairment test  the first step must be completed within six months of adoption and the second step  if necessary  must be completed by the end of the year 
amounts used in the transitional test shall be measured as of the beginning of the year 
an impairment loss resulting from application of the transitional goodwill impairment test shall be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
apria s transitional goodwill impairment test and overall evaluation of sfas no 
s impact is currently in progress  therefore it is not presently known whether adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  was million 
see amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
effective january  apria adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
discontinued operations will be measured similarly to other long lived assets classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
future operating losses will no longer be recognized before they occur 
sfas no 
also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity when operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  and establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale 
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on apria s financial statements 
results of operations net revenues 
approximately of apria s revenues are reimbursed under arrangements with medicare and medicaid 
in  no other third party payor represented or more of the company s revenues 
the majority of the company s revenues are derived from fees charged for patient care under fee for service arrangements 
revenues derived from capitation arrangements represented of total net revenues for because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third party reimbursement  there can be no assurance that apria s current revenue levels can be maintained  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
net revenues increased to  million in from  million in and million in growth rates were and in and  respectively 
the increases in both years are due to volume increases  new contracts with regional and national payors  the acquisition of complementary businesses and price increases in certain managed care agreements 
apria s acquisition strategy provides for the rapid integration of acquired businesses into existing operating locations 
this limits management s ability to separately track the amount of revenue generated by an acquired business 
estimating the revenue contribution from acquisitions therefore requires certain assumptions 
based on its analyses  apria management estimates from one fourth to one third of the revenue growth in was derived from acquisitions 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in thousands home respiratory therapy    home infusion therapy    home medical equipment other    total net revenues    home respiratory therapy 
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen systems  home ventilators  sleep apnea equipment  nebulizers  respiratory medications and related services 
the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased by in when compared to apria s strategy to target acquisitions of respiratory therapy businesses contributed to this growth in and home infusion therapy 
the infusion therapy service line involves the administration of a drug or nutrient directly into the body intravenously through a needle or catheter 
examples include parenteral nutrition  anti infectives  pain management  chemotherapy and other medications and related services 
the infusion line also includes enteral nutrition which is the administration of nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube 
infusion therapy revenues increased in versus and in versus the growth in both years is largely due to volume increases 
much of the increase in was concentrated in the enteral nutrient products and services category 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues are derived from the provision of patient safety items  ambulatory and patient room equipment 
home medical equipment other revenues increased by in from its level in and in from increases in this service line are usually lower than the other lines because the sales focus is placed on the higher margin respiratory therapy service line and on the infusion line 
the increase in reflects the restoration of the full medicare cost of living adjustment for certain durable medical equipment products and services that had been frozen since pursuant to the balanced budget act of a minimal increase was applied to reimbursement amounts in the first six months of in the second half of reimbursement was increased by approximately  which included a transitional allowance that effectively compressed a full year s consumer price index update into six months 
the transitional allowance did not carry forward into the base upon which the minimal increases were computed 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
the balanced budget act of contained a number of provisions that affected  or could potentially affect in the future  medicare reimbursement levels to apria 
although the medicare balanced budget refinement act of and the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of mitigated or delayed some of the effects of the original legislation  the following significant issues are still outstanding the balanced budget act of granted authority to the secretary of health and human services to increase or reduce the reimbursement for home medical equipment  including oxygen  by each year under an inherent reasonableness procedure 
however  under the provisions of the medicare balanced budget refinement act of  reimbursement reductions proposed under the inherent reasonableness procedure have been delayed pending a study by the general accounting office to examine the use of the authority granted under this procedure completed july  and promulgation by the centers for medicare medicaid services formerly the health care financing administration of a final rule implementing the inherent reasonableness authority not yet effected 
the balanced budget act of also mandated that the centers for medicare medicaid services conduct competitive bidding demonstrations for medicare part b items and services 
the competitive bidding demonstrations  currently in progress  could provide the centers for medicare medicaid services and congress with a model for implementing competitive pricing in all medicare programs 
if such a competitive bidding system were implemented  it could result in lower reimbursement rates  exclude certain items and services from coverage or impose limits on increases in reimbursement rates 
also at issue is a recommendation by the us department of health and human services that medicare claims processors base their payments for covered outpatient drugs and biologicals on pricing schedules other than the average wholesale price listing  which historically has been the industry s basis for drug reimbursement 
the suggested alternative pricing methodology was offered in an effort to reduce reimbursement levels for certain drugs to more closely approximate a provider s acquisition cost  but it would not have covered the costs that homecare pharmacies incur to prepare  deliver or administer the drugs to patients 
billing  collection and other overhead costs also would not have been considered 
under current government reimbursement schedules  these costs are not clearly defined but are implicitly covered in the reimbursement for the drug cost 
the healthcare industry has taken issue with the us department of health and human services approach for several reasons  primarily because it fails to consider the accompanying costs of delivering and administering these types of drug therapies to patients in their homes 
further  if providers choose to discontinue providing these drugs due to inadequate reimbursement  patient access may be jeopardized 
the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of delayed the adoption of proposed drug price changes and directed the general accounting office to conduct a thorough study  by september  to examine the adequacy of current payments and to recommend revised payment methodologies 
the study was completed but the authors acknowledged that the limited scope and deadline associated with the study did not allow for a thorough analysis of the homecare pharmacy aspect of covered services  legitimate service components and related costs do exist  and different methods of determining drug delivery and administration payments may be necessary for different types of drugs 
currently  the timing and impact of such pricing methodology revisions are not known 
in addition  some states have adopted  or are contemplating adopting  some form of the proposed alternate pricing methodology for certain drugs and biologicals under the medicaid program 
in several states these changes have reduced the level of reimbursement received by apria to an unacceptable level without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred 
in those states  apria has elected to stop accepting new medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs 
the company is continuing to provide services to patients already on service  and for those who receive other medicaid covered products and services 
further  the terrorist attacks of september  and the military and security activities which followed  their impacts on the united states economy and government spending priorities  and the effects of any further such developments pose risks and uncertainties to all us based businesses  including apria 
among other things  deficit spending by the government as the result of adverse developments in the economy and costs of the government s response to the terrorist attacks could lead to increased pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes  including governmentally funded programs such as medicare 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in the increase in reflects continued improvement from management s strategy to increase the proportion of higher margin respiratory revenues to total revenues 
much of the increase in as compared to was attributable to improved pricing negotiated for purchases of inventory  patient service equipment and related goods and the increase in the share of respiratory revenues 
further  the margins in and reflect the benefits of standardization initiatives and optimal operating models implemented in that were intended to achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies in the functional areas of purchasing  supply management and inventory management 
provision for doubtful accounts 
as described in the critical accounting policies section above  accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible are provided for through the application of specified percentages to each receivables aging category 
for  and  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and  respectively 
the provision rate reflects consistent cash collections and improvements in the accounts receivable aging 
see critical accounting policies and accounts receivable 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses incurred in direct support of operations and those associated with administrative functions 
expenses incurred by the operating locations include salaries and other expenses in the following functional areas selling  distribution  clinical  intake  reimbursement  warehousing and repair 
many of these operating costs are directly variable with revenue growth patterns 
some are also very sensitive to market driven price fluctuations such as facility lease and fuel costs 
the administrative expenses include overhead costs incurred by the operating locations and corporate support functions 
these expenses do not vary as closely with revenue growth as do the operating costs 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were in and for and the increase in is mainly due to merit and certain bonus plan increases 
the bonus plans for were adopted in late  when national unemployment rates were relatively low 
as a retention strategy  the bonus plans were extended to all employee groups and the payment provisions of these plans were enriched  thereby resulting in the expense increase 
the plans do not include such provisions 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in both years were directly related to the acquisitions that were consummated since late pursuant to a transition provision of sfas no 
 goodwill associated with business combinations completed after june  was not amortized  while amortization on goodwill existing at that date continued through the end of see recent accounting pronouncements and business combinations 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the significant decrease in when compared to is due to a number of factors 
long term debt decreased by million during the july refinancing replaced the senior subordinated notes with debt at significantly more favorable interest rates and also resulted in lower rates on the bank loans 
in connection with the refinancing  deferred debt issuance costs on the notes and old bank debt were written off  the issuance costs incurred upon refinancing resulted in a lower monthly amortization expense 
and finally  the dramatic decreases in market driven interest rates over the course of contributed to the overall decrease in apria s interest expense 
the decrease in versus was primarily attributable to the million reduction in long term debt as offset by higher interest rates incurred on the bank loans 
see long term debt 
income taxes 
income taxes for and were million and million  respectively  and were provided at the effective tax rates expected to be applicable for the respective year 
the income tax benefit for amounted to million  which was primarily attributable to the release of the company s million valuation allowance 
at december   apria had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring in varying amounts in the years through and various state operating loss carryforwards that began to expire in additionally  the company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
as a result of an ownership change in that met specified criteria of section of the internal revenue code  future use of a portion of the federal and state operating loss carryforwards generated prior to are each limited to approximately million per year 
because of the annual limitation  approximately million each of apria s federal and state operating loss carryforwards may expire unused 
the net operating loss carryforward amount in the related deferred tax asset excludes such amount 
management believes that its strategies will result in sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period to utilize apria s net operating loss carryforwards that are not limited by section liquidity and capital resources apria s principal source of liquidity is its operating cash flow  which is supplemented by a million revolving credit facility 
apria s ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of its operating needs has afforded it the ability  among other things  to pursue its acquisition strategy and fund patient service equipment expenditures to support revenue growth  while continuing to reduce long term debt 
apria s management believes that its operating cash flow and revolving credit line will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies 
however  sustaining the current cash flow levels is dependent on many factors  some of which are not within apria s control  such as government reimbursement levels and the financial health of its payors 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the cash flow increase in was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before items not requiring cash  plus the timing of disbursements processed through accounts payable 
partially offsetting this is an increase in accounts receivable due to the continued quarterly revenue increases 
increases in net income before non cash items  plus a reduction in the rate of increase in accounts receivable  resulted in cash flow improvements in as compared to cash used in investing activities increased in when compared to due to increases in business acquisitions and increases in patient service equipment purchases to support the growth in the respiratory service line 
cash used in decreased from due to a decrease in acquisition activity between the years and an increase in patient service equipment expenditures 
cash used in financing activities decreased between and primarily due to the following two items apria made no scheduled term loan payments on the former credit agreement in prior to the refinancing due to large prepayments made in the latter part of  and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes apria s long term cash payment obligations to which the company is contractually bound in millions total term loans revolving loans capitalized lease obligations operating leases deferred acquisition payments total contractual cash obligations accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million during which is directly attributable to the revenue increase 
days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were at december  compared to at december  and at december  see critical accounting policies 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
the increase in from the end of is largely due to acquisitions effected during the time consuming processes of converting patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from government payors routinely delay billing of the newly acquired business 
inventories and patient service equipment 
inventories consist primarily of pharmaceuticals and disposable articles used in conjunction with patient service equipment 
patient service equipment consists of respiratory and home medical equipment that is provided to in home patients for the course of their care plan and subsequently returned to apria for reuse 
the branch locations serve as the primary point from which inventories and patient service equipment are delivered to the patient 
the branches are supplied with inventory and equipment from the regional warehouses  where the purchasing responsibility lies 
the regions are also responsible for repairs and scheduled maintenance of patient service equipment  which adds to the frequent movement of equipment between the region and branch locations 
further  at any given time  more than of apria s patient service equipment is located in patients homes 
inherent in this asset flow is the fact that shortages will occur 
management has successfully instituted a number of controls over the company s inventories and patient service equipment to minimize such shortages 
however  there can be no assurance that apria will be able to maintain its current level of control over inventories and patient service equipment 
continued revenue growth is directly dependent on apria s ability to fund its inventory and patient service equipment requirements 
long term debt 
on july   apria closed a new million senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america  na the credit facilities consist of a million five year revolving credit facility  a million five year term loan and a million six year term loan 
the million term loan is repayable in consecutive quarterly installments of million to million each  commencing december  the million term loan is repayable in consecutive quarterly installments of  each  commencing december   followed by three consecutive quarterly installments of million each  and a final payment of million due on july  on december   the company made scheduled quarterly payments of million and  on the five year and six year term loans  respectively 
the company further reduced the outstanding debt on the five year term loan by making a voluntary prepayment of million on december  the voluntary prepayment was applied against future scheduled quarterly payments  effectively eliminating any pre payment requirements on the five year term loan until september the senior secured credit agreement permits apria to select one of two variable interest rates 
one option is the base rate  which is expressed as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus and b the prime rate 
the other option is the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest on outstanding balances under the senior secured credit agreement are determined by adding a margin to the eurodollar rate or base rate in effect at each interest calculation date 
the applicable margins for the revolving credit facility and the million term loan are based on apria s leverage ratio  which is the ratio of its funded debt to its last four quarters of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the applicable margin ranges from to for eurodollar loans and from to for base rate loans 
for the million term loan  the margins are fixed at for eurodollar loans and at for base rate loans 
the effective interest rate at december  was on total borrowings of million 
the senior credit agreement also requires payment of commitment fees ranging from to also based on apria s leverage ratio on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of apria 
the credit agreement contains numerous restrictions  including but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments and  restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
the agreement also permits apria to expend a maximum of million per year on acquisitions 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
the company s previous credit agreement and the million senior subordinated notes  both of which were scheduled to mature in late  were repaid in full concurrently with the closing of the new senior secured credit agreement 
in connection with the early retirement of its debt  apria wrote off the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees attributable to the subordinated notes and the previous credit agreement 
accordingly  apria recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  in the quarter ended september  on december   borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million  outstanding letters of credit totaled million and credit available under the revolving facility was million 
hedging activities 
apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria s policy for managing interest rate risk is to evaluate and monitor all available relevant information  including but not limited to  the structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities  historical interest rate trends and interest rate forecasts published by major financial institutions 
the tools apria may utilize to moderate its exposure to fluctuations in the relevant interest rate indices include  but are not limited to strategic determination of repricing periods and related principal amounts  and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements  caps or collars 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  apria entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to fix its libor based variable rate debt at before the applicable margin 
the swap agreements became effective october  and terminate on march  the swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
accordingly  the difference between the interest received and interest paid is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
for the period between the effective date of the swap agreements and december   apria paid a net settlement amount of  at december   the swap agreements are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet in other assets at their fair value of  unrealized gains on the fair value of the swap agreements are reflected  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
apria does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance as its counterparty to the swap agreements is a nationally recognized financial institution with a strong credit rating 
treasury stock 
in mid february  apria announced a plan to repurchase up to million of outstanding common stock during the first two quarters of depending on market conditions and other considerations  repurchases will be made from time to time in open market transactions 
from february  through march  apria repurchased  shares for million 
in  apria repurchased  shares of its common stock for  all repurchased common shares are being held in treasury 
apria s credit agreement limits common stock repurchases to million in any fiscal year and million in the aggregate over the term of the agreement 
business combinations 
pursuant to one of its primary growth strategies  apria periodically acquires complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
these transactions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the accompanying statements of operations from the dates of acquisition 
for business combinations closing on or before june   goodwill was being amortized over years 
for business combinations consummated between july  and december   no goodwill amortization was recorded 
covenants not to compete are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements 
the aggregate consideration for acquisitions that closed during was million 
allocation of this amount includes million to goodwill and intangible assets and million to patient service equipment 
during  the aggregate consideration for acquisitions was million 
cash paid for acquisitions  which includes amounts deferred from prior year acquisitions  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the success of apria s acquisition strategy is directly dependent on apria s ability to maintain and or generate sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
federal investigations 
as previously reported  since mid apria has been the subject of investigations conducted by several us attorneys offices and the us department of health and human services 
these investigations concern the documentation supporting apria s billing for services provided to patients whose healthcare costs are paid by medicare and other federal programs 
apria is cooperating with the government in connection with these investigations and is responding to various document requests and subpoenas 
a criminal investigation conducted by the us attorney s office in sacramento was closed in mid with no charges being filed 
potential claims resulting from an investigation by the us attorney s office in san diego were settled in mid in exchange for a payment by apria of  apria has been informed by the us attorney s office in los angeles that the investigation being conducted by that office is the result of civil qui tam litigation filed on behalf of the government against apria 
the complaints in the litigation are under seal  however  and the government has not informed apria of either the identities of the plaintiffs  the court or courts where the proceedings are pending  the date or dates instituted or the factual bases alleged to underlie the proceedings 
to date  the us attorney s office has not informed apria of any decision to intervene in the qui tam actions  however  it could reach a decision with respect to intervention at any time 
on july   government representatives and counsel for the plaintiffs in the qui tam actions asserted that  by a process of extrapolation from a sample of patient files to all of apria s billings to the federal government during the three and one half year sample period  apria could be liable to the government under the false claims act for more than billion  consisting of extrapolated overpayment liability  plus treble damages and penalties of up to  for each allegedly false claim derived from the extrapolation 
apria has acknowledged that there may be errors and omissions in supporting documentation affecting a portion of its billings 
however  it considers the assertions and amounts described in the preceding paragraph to be unsupported both legally and factually and believes that most of the alleged documentation errors and omissions should not give rise to any liability  for overpayment refunds or otherwise 
accordingly  apria believes that the claims asserted are unwarranted and that it is in a position to assert numerous meritorious defenses 
nevertheless  apria cannot provide any assurances as to the outcome of these proceedings 
management cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings and therefore has not recorded any related accruals 
if a judge  jury or administrative agency were to determine that false claims were submitted to federal healthcare programs or that there were significant overpayments by the government  apria could face civil and administrative claims for refunds  sanctions and penalties for amounts that would be highly material to its business  results of operations and financial condition  including the exclusion of apria from participation in federal healthcare programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria is party to two interest rate swap agreements that it utilizes to moderate such exposure 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   apria s term loan borrowings totaled million 
the bank credit agreement governing the term loans provides interest rate options based on the following indices federal funds rate  prime rate or libor 
all such interest rate options are subject to the application of an interest margin as specified in the bank credit agreement 
at december   all of apria s outstanding term debt was tied to libor 
during the fourth quarter of  apria entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to fix its libor based debt at before application of the interest margin 
the term of both agreements is october  to march  based on the term debt outstanding and the swap agreements in place at december   a basis point change in the applicable interest rates would increase or decrease apria s annual cash flow and pretax earnings by approximately million
