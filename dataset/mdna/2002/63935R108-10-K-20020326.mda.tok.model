item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company provides corporate travel management services to corporations  government agencies and the military and  to a more limited extent  other travel services  throughout the united states  canada  the united kingdom  brazil and thirteen other countries 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the ten companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies  the six companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies and the five companies acquired in business combinations in accounted for under the purchase method the purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks that have had a significant adverse effect on the global economy and commercial aviation industry 
these attacks caused a quick and severe decline in air travel 
for days after the attacks  air traffic within the united states stopped 
international air traffic was also affected 
when the nation s air space was opened to commercial flights  there were fewer passengers 
while air travel resumed  it remained depressed for the balance of the year  and most airlines have said that they do not expect travel to return to prior levels until late or the major airlines responded to the effects of the attacks by reducing schedules  decreasing service levels and making deep cuts in their work force 
in addition  governmental authorities increased security requirements  which tended to cause boarding delays and make air travel less enticing for many travelers 
all of these actions have impacted the company subsequent to september and are expected to continue to impact the company s operating results through most of in response  the company instituted several cost cutting measures the week of september   including an approximate workforce reduction and across the board salary and benefit reductions  which aggregates approximately million in annual savings 
in october  and again in february  the company negotiated amendments to both of its long term debt facilities  which changed certain financial covenants resulting in the company being in compliance with its credit agreements as of december  sources of revenue historically  arrangements between travel management companies and their clients generally did not provide for any direct compensation from clients for travel bookings and services completed on their behalf 
consequently  travel management companies were largely dependent for their revenues on the point of sale percentage commissions paid by the airlines for each ticket issued and to a lesser extent on hotel and car rental commissions 
since  the airlines instituted various commission caps and cut the base commission on domestic and international tickets 
in march  several us airlines eliminated base commissions and most of the other us airlines are expected to follow 
in response to the reduction in airline commissions and consistent with industry practice  the company has entered into management contracts and service fee arrangements with nearly all of its clients 
although the terms of the company s management contracts vary depending on the type of services provided and by client  the company typically deducts a pre negotiated management fee  its direct operating expenses and its indirect overhead costs from commissions collected for travel arrangements made on behalf of the client monthly 
if the commissions do not exceed the amounts deducted  the client pays the difference to the company 
if the commissions exceed the amounts deducted  the company typically pays the excess to the client 
in addition  the company typically charges a service fee for each ticket and other transactions to clients who do not have a management contract with the company 
the company charges between and for each air travel ticket issued to such clients and retains all of the related commissions collected from the airlines 
the company believes that its management contracts and service fee arrangements will minimize the financial impact of past commission caps and cuts  as well as the elimination of airline commissions 
the company believes that nearly all of its total transactions are currently generated from clients under management contracts and service fee arrangements 
the company has entered into agreements with major airlines for the payment of incentive override commissions in addition to the base commissions described above 
under these agreements  the airlines generally pay additional commissions on domestic and international air travel if the volume of the company s ticket sales surpasses specified thresholds  which typically are based on the airlines share of the relevant markets 
additionally  the company has negotiated favorable contracts with selected computer reservation systems vendors  hotel commission clearinghouses and rental car companies 
some of these contracts provide payments to the company of up front fees or annual payments or cost savings to navigant 
expenses the company s direct operating expenses include principally labor expense which comprised approximately  and of total direct operating expenses in  and  respectively  net commission payments to clients under management contracts  communication costs and other costs associated with the selling and processing of travel reservations 
the company s general and administrative expenses include principally labor expense which comprised approximately  and of total general and administrative expenses in  and  respectively  occupancy and other costs 
labor expense as a percentage of direct operating expenses and general and administrative expenses have been impacted by the reduction in transactions due to the terrorist attacks on september  and the acquisition of satotravel  which has larger call centers with sophisticated technology and reporting tools  and the nature of satotravel s customer base with an emphasis on military and government customers 
satotravel has a higher percentage of labor to direct operating expenses and a higher percentage of labor to general and administrative expenses than navigant 
as integration continues throughout and transaction levels resume to historical levels  the company expects these percentages to fall back down to historical levels 
in response to the reduction in transactions due to the terrorist attacks on september   the company instituted several cost cutting measures  including an approximate workforce reduction and across the board salary and benefit reductions  which aggregates approximately million in annual savings 
restructuring charges the company recorded a million restructuring charge in december the charge relates to an asset impairment to write down long lived assets of its subsidiary  firevine  as a result of the consolidation of firevine operations and infrastructure within navigant 
the restructuring of firevine eliminates several redundant assets and investments in infrastructure and partnerships and write down of technology that is no longer necessary based on integration with navigant s infrastructure 
the activity in the restructuring liability during was as follows in thousands fixed asset other impairment restructuring costs costs total restructuring charge   payments non cash usage   balance at december  restructuring charges the company implemented a cost reduction measure that commenced in march and resulted in the company s recording a restructuring charge of million in february and march the charge provides for the closure of five facilities and the severance associated with the elimination of approximately employee positions 
as of december   five facilities were closed or consolidated and employee positions were eliminated 
the activity in the restructuring liability during was as follows in thousands employee facility severance and closures and termination costs consolidation total restructuring charge   payments   non cash usage balance at december  critical accounting policies and estimates navigant s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon navigant s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires navigant to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  navigant evaluates these estimates 
navigant bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
navigant s critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition  
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  and 
valuation of long lived  tangible and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
revenues consist of commissions and fees on travel services and volume bonuses from travel service providers 
the company records revenues from air reservations  hotel and car reservations and service fee arrangements when earned  which is at the time a reservation is booked and ticketed 
management fees are recognized as revenue in the period benefited  which is generally on a monthly basis 
cruise revenues are recorded when the company s service obligation is complete  which is at the time the customer is no longer entitled to a full refund of the cost of the cruise 
the company records incentive override commissions on an accrual basis in the month they are earned based upon the company s estimated ticket sales in excess of required thresholds 
incentive payments from vendors for signing extended contracts are deferred and recognized as income over the life of the contract 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 
the company provides a reserve for cancellations and reservation changes  and provisions for such amounts are reflected in net revenues 
the provisions that have been netted against revenues are not material in the periods reflected 
the company s estimate for cancellations and reservation changes is based on historical levels and current economic trends and could vary significantly from actual results based upon changes in economic and political conditions that impact corporate travel patterns 
valuation of long lived  tangible and intangible assets and goodwill 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived  tangible and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the net book value  including associated intangible assets  of such operation 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived tangible assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  whichever is more readily determinable  depending on the nature of the assets 
net long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas became effective and as a result  navigant will cease to amortize goodwill 
the company estimates that the reduction of amortization expense following the implementation of fas will result in a increase in earnings per diluted common share in in lieu of amortization  navigant will perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
navigant is currently in the process of completing the initial impairment review 
the company does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review  however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with navigant s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items as a percentage of revenues for  and for the fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenues operating expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense

operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest consolidated results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december consolidated revenues increased  from million for to million for this increase was due to the inclusion of the revenues from the and purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition  which added approximately million in consolidated revenues 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenues in the last three quarters of associated with the overall downturn in the economy and the impact of the september attacks  which reduced air travel by over for the balance of these factors resulted in an overall reduction in business travel across all sectors  and for the company  transactions were down approximately in from operating expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the substantial reduction in business travel in the last three quarters of  as the company was unable to reduce staffing levels at the same pace and certain fixed operating expenses were being spread over a smaller revenue base 
additionally  during the first quarter of  operating expense as a percentage of revenues increased due to increased customer service demands during that quarter associated with continued labor related issues at united airlines and delta air lines  the poor weather and some decline in productivity associated with a decline in travel bookings in certain parts of the country  partially offset by internal growth and the results of spreading certain fixed operating expenses over a larger revenue base during the quarter 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the substantial reduction in business travel during the last three quarters of the year  as the company was unable to reduce staffing levels at the same pace and certain fixed general and administrative costs were being spread over a smaller revenue base 
the company recorded a million restructuring charge in and a million restructuring charge in the restructuring charge was related to an asset impairment charge to write down long lived assets of firevine as a result of the consolidation of firevine operations within navigant 
in  as part of the company s increased focus on regional operational structures and process flow  it undertook a formal plan approved by its board of directors for cost reduction measures including the elimination of duplicative facilities and the consolidation of certain regional operating functions 
the implementation of the cost reduction measures commenced in march and resulted in the company recording an aggregate restructuring charge of million in february and march depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for this increase was due to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions and the resultant higher goodwill amortization included in the results for compared to interest expense  net  increased from million or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition financing of the and purchased companies with borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the average debt balance for increased to million compared to million for resulting in approximately million in additional interest expense 
this increase was offset by the decrease in interest rates in resulting in million less interest expense as the company s average interest rate decreased from in to in provision for income taxes decreased from million for to million for  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the high effective income tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate of was primarily due to amortization of goodwill from acquisition activity that was not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective rate in was higher than the effective rate in due to an increase in the proportion of nondeductible goodwill amortization to total goodwill amortization in from acquisition activity and a decrease of pre tax income due to the september attacks 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  consolidated revenues increased  from million for to million for this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the revenues from the and purchased companies from their respective dates of acquisition  which added approximately million in consolidated revenues 
additionally  the company has increased revenues in through internal growth and improved national contracts with certain of its vendors 
operating expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the spreading of certain fixed operating expenses over a larger revenue base and an increase in revenue from certain vendors  due to the company s negotiation of improved national contracts with these vendors 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to incremental costs associated with the start up of firevine adding approximately million of additional general and overhead costs 
excluding the start up costs associated with firevine  the general and administrative expense for navigant for was  which approximates the general and administrative expense 
as part of the company s increased focus on regional operational structures and process flow in  it undertook a formal plan for cost reduction measures including the elimination of duplicative facilities and the consolidation of certain regional operating functions 
the implementation of the cost reduction measures commenced in march and resulted in the company recording an aggregate restructuring charge of million in february and march the company did not incur any restructuring charges in depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million  or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for this increase was due to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions and the resultant higher goodwill amortization included in the results for compared to interest expense  net  increased from million or of revenues  for to million  or of revenues  for the increase was attributable to financing the acquisition of the and purchased companies with borrowings under the company s credit facility as the average debt balance for increased to million compared to million for resulting in approximately million in interest expense 
additionally  the increase in interest rates associated with the federal reserve rate increases in resulted in million additional interest expense as the company s average effective interest rate  including debt issue cost amortization  increased from in to in provision for income taxes decreased from million for to million for  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the high effective income tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate of was primarily due to an increase in non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from acquisition activity 
the effective rate in was lower than the effective rate in due to a lower ratio of non deductible goodwill amortization to pre tax income in the later period

the company s capitalization  defined as the sum of long term debt and stockholders equity at december  was approximately million 
the company has financed its operational growth and acquisitions primarily from internally generated cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable the company to meet its working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment through at least fiscal based on current budgets

on october   the company sold a minority interest in its firevine subsidiary to a third party venture capital firm for million 
this minority interest could have been converted to an approximate stake in the subsidiary 
of the million investment  million was for  common units and the remaining million was for  convertible preferred units with a guaranteed dividend rate 
the holder of the million of convertible preferred units had the right to require that firevine redeem the units upon certain conditions  including if an initial public offering of the subsidiary did not occur within two years 
if the subsidiary did not redeem the units  the holder of the preferred units had the right to have the company redeem them 
additionally  firevine issued a warrant to this third party venture capital firm for an additional  common units  at an exercise price of per share that was exercisable anytime through october  in october  the holder of the convertible preferred units notified firevine that they were exercising their put right requiring firevine to redeem the units 
since an initial public offering of firevine had not occurred within two years of the original agreement  firevine was required to pay the redemption price of million original price plus accrued dividends 
on december   navigant negotiated a new agreement with the holder  wherein the holder surrendered all of their interest in firevine  including their common units and the  common units warrants  for a promise to pay the full redemption price in three installments million upon the signing of the new agreement  million due december  and the balance of million due march  on august   the company signed an amendment to its secured million credit facility  increasing the credit facility to million with the same terms and conditions 
the credit facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  subject to compliance with the applicable covenants 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire in august interest on borrowings under the credit facility accrues at a rate of  at the company s option  either i libor plus a margin of between and  depending on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio  or ii the alternative base rate defined as the higher of x the nationsbank  na prime rate and y the federal funds rate plus 
plus a margin of between 
and  depending on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility is subject to terms and conditions typical of facilities of such size and includes certain financial covenants 
on february   the company signed an amendment to the credit facility modifying certain of its terms and conditions 
the amendment decreased the amount available under the credit facility to million and adjusted certain ratios including the consolidated leverage ratio 
for the fiscal quarter ended march   the consolidated leverage ratio may not exceed 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio allowed is decreased until march   where it returns to its original level of 
as a condition of the increase in the ratio  the company will incur an increase in interest expense 
based on the average outstanding balance on the credit facility in of approximately million  the increased interest rate for will result in up to million of additional interest expense for the year 
on november   the company authorized the issuance and sale of million aggregate principal amount of its senior secured notes 
the notes are payable in three equal installments of million due november   and  respectively 
the financial covenants are consistent with those of the credit facility 
on february   the company signed an amendment to the note purchase agreements dated november  modifying certain terms and conditions of the note purchase agreements  including an increase in the maximum allowable debt to ebitda ratio 
as a condition of the increase in the ratio  the company is required to pay additional interest on a quarterly basis based on the debt to ebitda ratio 
the additional consideration could result in up to million of additional interest expense for the company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  although management does not intend to complete as many acquisitions in as the company completed in prior years 
in addition  the amendments to the credit facility and the senior secured notes  restrict the size and form of acquisitions the company can complete during the term of the amendments 
nevertheless  the company may be in various stages of negotiation  due diligence and documentation of potential acquisitions at any time 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
the company expects to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including borrowings under the credit facility  as well as issuance of additional equity or debt 
to the extent the company funds a significant portion of the consideration for future acquisitions with cash  it may have to increase the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility or obtain other sources of financing through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure such financing if and when it is needed or on terms the company deems acceptable 
if the company is unable to secure acceptable financing  its acquisition program could be negatively affected 
capital expenditures for equipment and expansion of facilities are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and supplemented as necessary by borrowings under the credit facility 
derivatives the company may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate or eliminate certain risks  primarily interest changes  associated with the company s debt structure 
the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert a part of its nonprepayable fixed rate long term debt to floating rate 
the notional amount of these types of interest rate swaps aggregated million 
the company s policy is to convert between and of all nonprepayable fixed rate debt to floating rate debt  with the percentage depending on contract interest rates  maturities and expected balance on the company s floating rate revolving debt facility 
this interest rate swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a net gain of reported as a reduction of interest expense  which represented the swap s ineffectiveness 
all components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as december   the fair value of the swap was  which is recorded in other assets and other long term liabilities 
the company also entered into a forward interest rate swap to convert floating rate loans to fixed rate loans 
specific amounts that the company hedges are determined based on the prevailing market conditions and the current shape of the yield curve 
the specific terms and notional amounts of the swaps are determined based on management s assessment of future interest rates  as well as other factors  including short term strategic initiatives 
the notional amount of these types of interest rate swaps aggregated million 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges of future cash flows  the effective portion of changes in fair value is recorded temporarily as a component of equity  and is then recognized in earnings along with the related effects of the hedged items 
any ineffective portion of a hedge is reported in earnings as it occurs 
for the year ended december   the company did not report a loss or a gain associated with the total ineffectiveness of all cash flow hedges 
all components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as of december   the fair value of the cash flow hedges aggregates  which is recorded in other long term liabilities and as an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the business travel industry is seasonal and the company s results have fluctuated because of these seasonal variations 
net revenues and net income for the company are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters 
the company expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also be subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in relationships with certain travel suppliers  changes in the mix of services offered by the company  extreme weather conditions or other factors affecting travel 
unexpected variations in quarterly results could also adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  which in turn could limit the ability of the company to make acquisitions 
as the company continues to complete acquisitions  it may become subject to additional seasonal influences 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in the prices paid by the company for the products it sells  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies acquired may differ substantially from those of the company  which could contribute to the further fluctuation in its quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas  as subsequently amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
fas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the adoption of fas in the first quarter of did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in june of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and fas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after december  december  for the company 
fas eliminates pooling of interest as a method of accounting for acquisitions subsequent to june  fas eliminates the amortization of goodwill on an annual basis and requires an initial and subsequent annual impairment test to determine whether the goodwill should be adjusted downward to fair market value 
the company is currently in the process of determining the effect that these pronouncements will have on its operating results  particularly the impairment provisions 
however  the company will cease amortizing goodwill effective december  goodwill amortization expense recorded during the year ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
in june of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
the company will adopt fas no later than december  under fas  the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation covered under the scope of fas would be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability would be accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost would be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity would either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
the adoption of fas will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
on october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
the company will adopt fas no later than december  fas retains the fundamental provisions of existing generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the recognition and measurement of long lived asset impairment contained in fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
however  fas provides new guidance intended to address certain significant implementation issues associated with fas  including expanded guidance with respect to appropriate cash flows to be used to determine whether recognition of any long lived asset impairment is required  and if required how to measure the amount of the impairment 
fas also requires that any net assets to be disposed of by sale be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell  and expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include any component of an entity with operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity 
the company believes the adoption of fas will not presently have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
risk factors significant indebtedness and interest payment obligations navigant is significantly leveraged 
at december   navigant had million of consolidated outstanding debt and its total consolidated debt  as a percentage of capitalization  was 
navigant may also need to incur additional debt in the future to complete acquisitions or capital projects or for working capital even though its credit facility and senior secured notes impose some limits on its ability to do so 
navigant s high level of indebtedness could have important consequences to its stockholders  which include the following 
its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its business strategy  debt service requirements  capital expenditures  working capital or other purposes may be impaired  
its ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business will be limited because navigant must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to pay interest and principal on its debt  
certain of its borrowings bear interest at variable rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates  
it may not be able to compete with others who are not as highly leveraged  and 
its significant leverage may limit its flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions  changes in its industry and economic downturns 
navigant s ability to pay interest on its debt obligations will depend upon its future operating performance and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond navigant s control  will affect its ability to make these payments 
if in the future navigant cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet its obligations  navigant will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
navigant cannot assure its stockholders that its business will generate cash flow  or that it will be able to obtain funding sufficient to satisfy its debt service requirements 
restrictions imposed by terms of indebtedness the covenants in navigant s existing debt agreements  including the credit facility  the senior secured notes and any future financing agreements may adversely affect its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
these covenants limit or restrict navigant s ability to 
incur additional debt or prepay or modify any additional debt that may be incurred  
make certain acquisitions or investments  
pay dividends and make distributions  
repurchase its securities  
create liens  
transfer or sell assets  
enter into transactions with affiliates  
issue or sell stock of subsidiaries  
merge or consolidate  or 
materially change the nature of its business 
the amendments to navigant s credit facility and the senior secured notes executed in november of and february also limit navigant s ability to consummate certain acquisitions without the consent of the participating banks and institutional note holders 
these limitations may reduce navigant s ability to continue its acquisition program 
in addition  navigant s credit facility also requires it to comply with certain financial ratios 
navigant s ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control 
if navigant breaches any of these covenants in its credit facility or senior secured notes  or if navigant is unable to comply with the required financial ratios  it may be in default under its credit facility or senior secured notes 
a significant portion of navigant s indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable 
navigant is not certain whether it would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
compliance with the covenants is also a condition to revolver borrowings under the credit facility on which navigant relies to fund its liquidity 
holding company structure navigant is a holding company 
navigant s subsidiaries conduct substantially all of its consolidated operations and own substantially all of its consolidated assets 
consequently  navigant s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations depend upon the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the payment of funds by its subsidiaries to navigant in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
navigant s subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to navigant for payment on debt or otherwise 
in addition  their ability to make any payments will depend on their earnings  the terms of their indebtedness  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions 
risks related to revenue historically  corporate travel management companies were largely dependent for their air travel ticketing revenues on the point of sale percentage commissions paid by airlines for each ticket issued 
since  most airlines have substantially reduced the amount of commissions paid to travel agents for booking domestic and international flights 
the airlines have both capped the total commissions paid per ticket and reduced the commission rates per ticket payable to travel agents and may further reduce commissions in the future 
further reductions in commissions may reduce navigant s revenue 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of navigant introduction sources of revenue in item there can be no assurance that the airlines will not further reduce commissions 
navigant has responded to the reductions in the commissions paid by airlines by entering into management contracts and service fee arrangements with many of its corporate clients 
although the terms of its management contracts vary depending on the type of services provided and by client  navigant typically deducts a pre negotiated management fee  its direct operating expenses and its indirect overhead costs from commissions collected for travel arrangements made on behalf of the client 
if the commissions do not exceed the amounts deducted  the client pays the difference to navigant 
if the commissions exceed the amounts deducted  navigant typically pays the excess to the client 
in addition  navigant typically charges a service fee for each ticket and other transactions to clients who do not have a management contract with navigant 
in the future navigant may not be able to maintain or continue to negotiate management contracts or continue to receive current levels of fees from those contracts  and also may not be able to charge service fees or maintain the level of such service fees 
navigant also derives part of its revenues from incentive override commissions paid by the major airlines 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction sources of revenue in item if  during any period  navigant fails to meet incentive levels  revenues could decrease 
in addition  the airlines may reduce or terminate incentive override commissions and navigant may not be able to extend its current incentive override commission arrangements or enter into new arrangements that are as favorable as its current arrangements 
substantial competition and industry consolidation  new methods of distribution the corporate travel management industry is extremely competitive 
navigant competes primarily with other corporate travel management companies 
some of navigant s competitors have greater brand name recognition and financial resources than navigant 
competition within the corporate travel management industry is increasing as the industry undergoes a period of consolidation 
certain of navigant s competitors are expanding their size and financial resources through consolidation 
some travel management companies may have relationships with certain travel suppliers which give them access to favorable availability of products including airplane seats and hotel rooms or more competitive pricing than that offered by navigant 
furthermore  some corporate travel management companies have a strong presence in particular geographic areas which may make it difficult for navigant to attract customers in those areas 
as a result of competitive pressures  navigant may suffer a loss of clients  and its revenues or margins may decline 
navigant also competes with travel suppliers  including airlines  hotels and rental car companies 
innovations in technology  such as the internet and computer online services  have increased the ability of travel suppliers to distribute their travel products and services directly to consumers 
although corporate travel management companies and travel agencies remain the primary channel for travel distribution  businesses and consumers can now use the internet to access information about travel products and services and to purchase such products and services directly from the suppliers  thereby bypassing corporate travel management companies and travel agents 
navigant believes that no single internet based service presently provides access to the full range of information available to navigant and its agents 
an internet based travel service may  however  provide such access in the future 
in addition  although navigant believes the service  knowledge and skills of its employees and its incorporation of new  alternative distribution channels position it to compete effectively in the changing industry  there can be no assurance that navigant will compete successfully or that the failure to compete successfully will not have a material adverse effect on navigant s financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on travel suppliers navigant is dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services including airplane seats and hotel rooms 
certain travel suppliers offer navigant pricing that is preferential to published fares  enabling navigant to offer prices lower than would be generally available to travelers and other corporate travel management companies or travel agents 
travel suppliers can generally cancel or modify their agreements with navigant upon relatively short notice  leaving navigant subject to the loss of contracts  changes in its pricing agreements  commission schedules and incentive override commission arrangements  and more restricted access to travel suppliers products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon technology navigant s business is dependent upon a number of different information and telecommunications technologies 
in addition  navigant s ability to quote air travel ticket prices  make reservations and sell tickets is dependent upon its contractual right to use  and the performance of  computer reservation systems operated by sabre  galileo apollo and worldspan 
navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these technologies or systems fail  or if navigant s access to these systems is restricted 
risks associated with the corporate travel management industry  general economic conditions navigant s operating results generally depend upon factors affecting the corporate travel management industry 
navigant s revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect business air travel  and the level of car rentals and hotel reservations 
a number of factors  including recession or slower economic growth  rising travel costs  extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety  could result in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for business travel 
advances in technology and communications  such as videoconferencing and internet based teleconferencing  may also adversely impact travel patterns and travel demand 
navigant believes that price based competition will continue in the airline industry for the foreseeable future 
the continuation of such competition and the occurrence of any of the events described above could have a material adverse effect on navigant s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to integration of operations and acquisitions one of navigant s strategies is to increase operating margins by consolidating and integrating certain administrative functions common to all of its subsidiaries 
each new acquisition results in additional integration of operations 
this integration will require substantial attention from senior management and may require future substantial capital expenditures 
the integration process may disrupt navigant s operations as well as those of its subsidiaries as its management s attention is diverted from other tasks  and as technological  practical or personnel issues arise 
currently  navigant and its subsidiaries  satotravel  navigant uk and navigant brazil  operate on separate computer systems and navigant and most of its subsidiaries operate on separate telephone systems  several of which use different technologies 
navigant expects that it will integrate these systems  but it has not yet established a definitive timetable for integration of all of such systems or its definitive capital needs for the integration 
the contemplated integration of these systems may cause disruption to navigant s business and may not result in the intended cost efficiencies 
in addition  rapid changes in technologies may require capital expenditures to improve or upgrade client service 
risks related to navigant s acquisition strategy general 
one of navigant s strategies is to increase its revenues and the markets it serves through the acquisition of additional corporate travel companies 
navigant may not be able to make acquisitions at the pace it desires or on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  the consolidation of the travel management industry has reduced the number of companies available for sale  which could lead to higher prices being paid for the acquisition of the remaining travel management companies 
the companies navigant has acquired  or which navigant may acquire in the future  may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify navigant s investment in them 
navigant s acquisitions of companies outside the united states may subject it to certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  new and different legal and regulatory requirements and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
integration 
integration of operations of the companies navigant acquired or may acquire in the future may also involve a number of special risks  which may have adverse short term effects on navigant s operating results 
these may be caused by 
severance payments to employees of acquired companies  
restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions  and 
other expenses associated with a change in control 
integration of acquired companies may also result in 
diversion of management s attention  
difficulties with retention  
the need to hire and train key employees  
risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  and 
impairment of goodwill under fas navigant conducts due diligence and generally requires representations  warranties and indemnifications from the former owners of acquired companies 
navigant cannot be certain  however  that such owners will have accurately represented the financial and operating conditions of their companies 
if an acquired company s financial or operating results were misrepresented  the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on navigant s results of operations and financial condition 
financing 
navigant currently intends to finance its future acquisitions by using cash  borrowed funds  shares of its common stock or a combination thereof 
if navigant s common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  if its price is highly volatile  or if  for other reasons  potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept navigant s common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  navigant may then be required to use more of its cash resources or more borrowed funds in order to maintain its acquisition program 
if navigant is unable to use common stock for acquisitions and navigant does not have sufficient cash resources  its growth could be limited unless navigant is able to obtain additional capital through debt or other financing 
navigant may not be able to obtain additional capital  if and when needed  on terms navigant deems acceptable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors restrictions imposed by terms of indebtedness in item reliance on key personnel navigant s operations depend on the continued efforts of edward s 
adams  its chief executive officer  c 
thomas nulty  its president and chief operating officer  robert c 
griffith  its chief financial officer and treasurer  its other executive officers and the senior management of its subsidiaries 
furthermore  navigant s operations will likely depend on the senior management of the companies that may be acquired in the future 
if any of these people become unable to continue in his or her present role  or if navigant is unable to attract and retain other skilled employees  its business could be adversely affected 
material amount of goodwill as of december   approximately million  or  of navigant s total assets and of navigant s stockholders equity represent intangible assets  the significant majority of which is goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
through december   navigant amortized goodwill on a straight line method over a period of years with the amount amortized in a particular period constituting a non cash expense that reduces its net income 
in fiscal year  the company will adopt the provisions of fas and discontinue the amortization of goodwill 
goodwill will no longer be amortized  instead it will be tested for impairment upon adoption and then annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
a reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill would affect financial results and could have a material and adverse impact upon the market price of navigant common stock 
navigant believes that anticipated cash flows and fair value associated with intangible assets recognized in connection with its acquisitions will continue and there presently is no persuasive evidence that any material portion will be impaired when the rules of fas are applied 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the domestic and international travel service industry is extremely seasonal 
navigant s past results have fluctuated because of seasonal variations in the travel services industry 
navigant s net revenues and net income are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter 
navigant expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
navigant s quarterly results of operations may also be subject to fluctuations as a result of the timing and cost of acquisitions  changes in relationships with certain travel suppliers  changes in the mix of services offered by navigant  the timing of the payment of incentive override commissions by travel suppliers  extreme weather conditions or other factors affecting travel 
risk of rapid growth navigant was formed through the acquisition of twelve corporate travel management companies from january through may  and navigant has made acquisitions since that time 
navigant expects to continue to grow in part through acquisitions 
the rapid pace of acquisitions has  and will continue to  put pressure on navigant s executive management  personnel and corporate support systems 
any inadequacy of navigant s systems to manage the increased size and scope of operations resulting from growth could adversely affect navigant s operations  business and financial results and condition 
potential liabilities related to distributions in connection with the distributions of the shares of four us office products businesses including navigant in june  navigant and three other companies whose shares were distributed by us office products entered into a series of agreements providing the allocation of certain liabilities 
navigant and the other companies agreed in a tax allocation agreement to jointly and severally indemnify us office products for tax losses relating to the distribution that are attributable to acts or omissions of navigant and the other companies 
a tax indemnification agreement among navigant and the other spun off companies requires each company responsible for tax losses to indemnify the other companies for those losses and their liabilities to us office products under the tax allocation agreement 
if the tax losses are not attributable to either us office products or any of the other companies  each of the companies and us office products is liable for its pro rata portion of the losses based on the value of each company s common stock after the distributions 
navigant also entered into a distribution agreement with us office products under which navigant is responsible for liabilities related to its business  certain employee benefits liabilities  securities laws liabilities arising from the distribution of navigant shares  its initial public offering and information related to its business supplied to us office products  and us office products liabilities for earn outs from acquisitions of its subsidiaries made prior to the distribution 
navigant and the other companies that were spun off have also agreed to bear a pro rata portion of certain united states securities law and general corporate liabilities of us office products incurred prior to the distribution including a pro rata portion of any liability of another spun off company to us office products that is not paid up to a maximum of million for each company 
jonathan j 
ledecky  a previous member of navigant s board of directors  and us office products have been named as defendants in at least lawsuits alleging that mr 
ledecky and us office products violated various united states securities laws 
the plaintiffs in those lawsuits generally claim that mr 
ledecky  on behalf of us office products  made a series of materially false and misleading statements in connection with the distributions of the shares of navigant and the other companies and the related tender offer and restructuring 
although neither navigant nor its executive officers have been named as defendants in these lawsuits  navigant could be required pursuant to the distribution agreement to indemnify us office products for a portion of its liability in connection with these lawsuits 
on march  us office products filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware and  on december   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware approved us office product s joint liquidating plan of reorganization 
dependence on arc agreements navigant depends on the ability to sell airline tickets for a substantial portion of its revenue 
to sell airline tickets  navigant must enter into  and maintain  an agent reporting agreement for each operating subsidiary with the airlines reporting company arc 
agent reporting agreements impose numerous financial  operational and administrative obligations on navigant 
these agreements allow arc to cancel an agent reporting agreement for failure to meet any of these obligations 
if navigant s agent reporting agreements are cancelled by arc  navigant would be unable to sell airline tickets and its results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks related to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company s interest rate exposure relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
a significant portion of the company s interest expense is based upon variable interest rates of its bank s prime rate or the eurodollar rate  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
based upon the company s outstanding long term debt subject to variable interest rates under the credit facility at december  of million  a basis point movement in the base rate or the libor rate would approximate a  annual increase or decrease in interest expense
