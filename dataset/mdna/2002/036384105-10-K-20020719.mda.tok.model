critical accounting policies ansoft s critical accounting policies are as follows o revenue recognition o valuation of accounts receivable o impairment of long lived assets o impairment of marketable securities available for sale o deferred tax asset valuation allowance revenue recognition license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the revenue allocated to software products is recognized after shipment of the products and fulfillment of acceptance terms 
postcontract customer support pcs is bundled with the initial licensing fee and is recognized together with the initial licensing fee on delivery of the software if collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable  enhancements are limited to bug fixes covered by warranty provisions  and the costs of providing these services are expected to be insignificant 
during the year ended april   the company changed the pcs period bundled with the initial licensing from a one year period to a three month period 
revenue related to the three month pcs is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue related to all other pcs arrangements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from customer training  support and other services is recognized as the service is performed 
valuation of accounts receivable management reviews accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers ansoft s history of write offs  relationships with its customers  and the overall credit worthiness of its customers 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
impairment of marketable securities available for sale an impairment charge is recorded if a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance has been established 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates
