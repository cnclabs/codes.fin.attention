we experienced operational difficulties in fiscal and the first half of fiscal problems with our direct sales operation and intense competition  among other factors  contributed to net losses in fiscal and fiscal and a decline in revenue in fiscal and  including significant declines in software revenue 
in response to these challenges  we implemented a restructuring program 
as part of this program  we hired a new chief executive officer and subsequently rebuilt the senior management team  enhanced our supply chain optimization products and services  expanded the scope of our product and service offerings to include supplier relationship management  service parts management and pricing and revenue optimization through strategic acquisitions 
we also improved our direct sales organization performance by expanding our number of target markets  improving personnel  and adapting our sales approach to better address customer challenges 
as a result of these actions  we have been able to nearly double our annual revenue between fiscal and  improve our working capital and liquidity through a million convertible debt offering in fiscal and improve our ability to compete 
during fiscal  our revenue grew 
although we reported a significant increase in our net loss under generally accepted accounting principles gaap we reported a net loss of million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  our adjusted net income was million  an improvement of million from fiscal during fiscal  the company faced new challenges in its ability to grow revenue  improve operating performance and expand market share as a result of progressive weakening of global economic conditions 
the weakening macroeconomic environment included a recession in the united states economy that was fueled by substantial reductions in capital spending by united states corporations  especially information technology spending 
economic conditions deteriorated more severely as a result of the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   subsequent bioterrorism threats and resulting political and military actions 
during our second and third quarters of fiscal  we experienced delays in consummating software license transactions  especially during the last few days of the quarter ended august  the delays were caused primarily by prospects concerns about committing to large capital projects in the face of uncertain global economic conditions 
we believe that these concerns were heightened further by the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  making it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues while global economic conditions were uncertain 
late in our quarter ended november   we began to see improvements in closure rates on software license transactions 
our closure rates on software license transactions continued to improve during our quarter ended february   as evidenced by increases in software revenue as compared to our second and third quarters of fiscal in response to the downturn in the global economy during fiscal  and the related impact on our financial performance  we implemented several cost containment measures during the second half of fiscal to reduce our operating cost structure 
we reduced our workforce  implemented a temporary mandatory leave without pay program for all united states employees and a voluntary leave without pay program in europe  reduced the use of outside contractors for product development initiatives and professional service providers and reduced travel expenses 
the mandatory leave without pay program in the united states began on october  and was eliminated on march  the voluntary leave without pay program in europe began on january  and is expected to last approximately six months 
despite the challenges we faced during fiscal  we were able to report record annual revenue of million  an increase of compared to fiscal we reported a significant increase in our net loss under gaap we reported a net loss of million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal and our adjusted net loss was million  or a million decrease from fiscal our successful implementation of cost containment initiatives during the second half of fiscal better aligned our operating cost structure with the anticipated reduction in revenue levels due to the downturn in the global economy 
as a result  we were able to reduce our quarterly adjusted net loss from million during the quarter ended august  to million during the quarter ended february  adjusted net income or loss is the internal measure of profitability used by our management to judge operating performance 
adjusted net income or loss equals net income or loss as determined under gaap less i amortization of intangibles and acquired technology  ii non cash stock compensation benefit expense  iii restructuring expenses benefits  iv purchased research and development expense and v the loss associated with our investment in converge inc and the iri settlement  along with the related income tax effects 
adjusted net income or loss as measured by the company is not determined in accordance with gaap  is not indicative of cash used by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  measures of operating performance determined in accordance with gaap 
additionally  our calculation of adjusted net income or loss may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  and deferred income taxes 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of software revenue  services revenue and support revenue 
software revenue is generally recognized upon execution of a software license agreement and shipment of the software  provided the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements based on historical fair value experience 
if a software license agreement contains an undelivered element  the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months from the agreement date 
where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the agreement date  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
when we provide services that are considered essential to the functionality of software products sold or if software sold requires significant production  modification or customization  we account for the software and services revenue in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  which requires us to use the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
in these cases  software revenue is recognized based on labor hours incurred to date compared to total estimated labor hours for the contract 
implementation services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
implementation services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training  are typically billed on an hourly basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts 
implementation services billed on an hourly basis are recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
support revenue includes post contract support and the rights to unspecific software upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from customer support services are generally billed annually with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three years in the period ended february   our provision for doubtful accounts has ranged between approximately and of total revenues 
we initially record the provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
capitalized software we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients 
software development costs are amortized at the greater of the amount computed using either a the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  commencing with the date the product is first available for general release  or b the ratio that current gross revenue bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue 
generally  an economic life of two years is assigned to capitalized software development costs 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill and other intangible assets  including acquired technology  are amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years 
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of march   and  as a result  we will no longer amortize goodwill 
we will perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal and additional impairment reviews annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
upon completion of our initial impairment review  we do not expect to record an impairment charge 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the amount we have recorded 
revenue software revenue 
software revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to economic uncertainty and a related decline in information technology spending  including software  which resulted in a decrease in the number of completed software license transactions and average selling price asp 
the increases in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to increased demand and market acceptance for our software products  increased selling activities resulting from a larger and more effective sales force  increased asp and number of completed transactions and enhanced product offerings 
the following table summarizes our software transactions for fiscal  and fiscal year ended february or  significant software transactions number of transactions average selling price in thousands   significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal year 
the following table summarizes the number of software transactions of million or greater fiscal year ended february or  software transactions million million software transactions million million software transactions million or greater total software transactions million or greater we believe the reduction in software transactions of million or greater in fiscal is primarily the result of companies becoming more cautious and deliberate regarding commitments to large capital expenditures due to the uncertain global economic conditions 
the increase in software transactions of million or greater in fiscal year was primarily the result of increased demand and market acceptance of our software products and our expanded and enhanced product offerings 
services revenue 
services revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in services revenue in fiscal and fiscal were due to an increased number of implementations  an increased customer base desiring training  consulting and implementation services and the talus acquisition 
we believe that  as a result of the decrease in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal  services revenue growth in fiscal will be lower than we have experienced in the past two fiscal years 
services revenue tends to track software license revenue in prior periods 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
support revenue 
support revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in support revenue in fiscal and fiscal was due to the increase in the number of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual support arrangements coupled with renewals of annual support agreements by our existing client base 
in the past  we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts 
there can no assurance that this renewal rate will continue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
international revenue 
we market and sell our software and services internationally primarily in europe  asia  canada and latin america 
revenue outside of the united states increased  or million  to million in fiscal and increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenue outside of the united states as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal and and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in our international revenue resulted from our efforts to expand our presence and selling efforts outside of the united states 
we believe increasing international revenue is critical to our growth in both revenue and profitability and may lower our overall exposure to unfavorable economic conditions in specific regions 
operating expenses cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalty fees associated with third party software either embedded in our software or resold by us 
the following table sets forth amortization of capitalized software development costs and other costs of software for the three fiscal years ended february or   and in thousands fiscal year ended february or  amortization of capitalized software    percentage of software revenue other costs of software    percentage of software revenue total cost of software    percentage of software revenue the increase in cost of software in fiscal was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software resulting from an increase in the number of product development initiatives 
cost of software increased in fiscal primarily as a result of increases in royalties paid to third parties as a result of the mix of software sold and an increase in software revenue 
amortization of acquired technology 
in connection with our acquisitions of the csd division of partminer and spaceworks intellectual property during fiscal  and talus and stg during fiscal  and certain previous acquisitions  we acquired developed technology that we offer as part of our integrated solutions 
acquired technology is amortized over periods ranging from four to six years 
cost of services and support 
cost of services and support includes primarily personnel and third party contractor costs 
cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of services and support increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in cost of services and support during fiscal and was attributable to adding the personnel necessary to support the growth in services and support revenue and installed customer base  as well as the talus acquisition in december the increase in cost of services and support in fiscal as a percentage of related revenue reflects i increased use of outside contractors needed to support the increased demand of implementation services during our first three quarters in fiscal and ii an increase in the proportion of this revenue derived from implementation services  which historically realize lower margins than maintenance services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional events such as trade shows and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sales and marketing expense increased  or million in fiscal  and increased  or million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to increased personnel costs resulting from an increase in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  partially offset by lower sales commissions resulting from decreased software sales 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the combination of lower sales commissions due to decreased software revenue  flat promotional spending and higher revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increased personnel costs resulting from an increase in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees from in fiscal  increased sales commissions due to higher software revenue  and increases in promotional spending  advertising and public relations spending to rebrand and reposition our solutions in the marketplace 
product development 
product development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new software products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities  net of capitalized software development costs 
such costs are primarily from personnel and third party contractors 
the following table sets forth product development costs for the three fiscal years ended february  in thousands fiscal year ended february or  gross product development costs    percentage of total revenue less capitalized software development costs    percentage of total revenue product development costs  as reported    percentage of total revenue gross product development costs increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal net product development costs increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increases in fiscal were due to an increase in the average number of product development employees to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal and fourth quarter of fiscal  and an increased number of product development initiatives 
the increase in gross and net product development costs in fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in the average number of product development employees  an increase in the usage of outside contractors and an increase in the number of product development initiatives 
the increase in product development expenses as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal is primarily the result of the increased number of new product development initiatives commenced by the company  the expected time taken to fully integrate the technologies and product development personnel of the companies we acquired and lower growth in total revenue 
we expect to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our legal  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and information systems functions 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in fiscal and  or million  in fiscal the increases in fiscal and were due primarily to an increase in personnel to support our growth 
amortization of intangibles 
our acquisitions of the csd division of partminer and one release during fiscal and talus and stg during fiscal year and certain previous acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets other than acquired technology are amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years 
details of our acquisitions are included in note acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
purchased research and development and acquisition related expenses 
our acquisitions of talus and stg included the purchase of technology that has not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its then current stage of development 
accordingly  in fiscal  the portion of the purchase price for talus and stg allocated to purchased research and development of million  in aggregate  was expensed immediately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
details of our acquisitions are included in note acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
restructuring expenses benefits 
during our second and third quarters of fiscal  we adopted two restructuring plans 
as a result  we incurred restructuring expenses of million in fiscal the costs were primarily attributable to remaining lease obligations  severance and related benefits and employee relocation costs 
during fiscal  we reduced a previously reported restructuring charge by million due to changes in estimates related to better than expected success in subleasing abandoned and excess office space which was offset in part by higher than expected severance costs 
details of our restructuring charges benefits are included in note restructuring in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
non cash stock compensation benefit expense 
we recognized non cash stock compensation benefit expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal associated with stock options that were repriced in january  net of unvested stock options assumed in the talus acquisition 
these amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders equity and are amortized by charges to operations in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
repriced options in january  we repriced certain employee stock options  other than those held by executive officers or directors 
this resulted in approximately million options being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
under fin  repriced options are subject to variable plan accounting  which requires compensation cost or benefit to be recorded each period based on changes in the company s stock price until the repriced options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
this resulted in a benefit of million in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal no adjustments were made upon initial application of fin for periods prior to july  the initial fair value used to measure the ongoing stock compensation charge or benefit was based on the closing price of our common stock on june  as of february   approximately million repriced options were still outstanding with a remaining vesting period of approximately one year 
in future periods  we will record additional charges or benefits related to the repriced stock options still outstanding based on the change in our common stock price compared to the last reporting period 
if our stock price at the beginning and end of any reporting period is below  no charge or benefit will be recorded 
unvested stock options talus acquisition as part of the talus acquisition  we assumed all outstanding stock options  which were converted into our stock options 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were unvested at the acquisition date 
fin requires the acquiring company to measure the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed at the acquisition date in a purchase business combination and record a compensation charge over the remaining vesting period of those options to the extent those options remain outstanding 
this resulted in a charge of million in fiscal and million during fiscal as of february   approximately  of these options remained unvested with remaining vesting periods up to years 
iri settlement 
the iri settlement charge of million in fiscal represents the amount in excess of a liability accrued in prior years for the resolution of a dispute between the company and information resources  inc iri 
details of the iri settlement are included in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other expense income  net other expense income  net  includes interest income from cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest expense from borrowings  foreign currency exchange gains or losses and other gains or losses 
other expense  net was million in fiscal compared to other income  net of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the change in fiscal relates primarily to an impairment loss we recorded of approximately million relating to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our equity investment in converge  inc see note investments in businesses in notes to consolidated financial statements and higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of million in convertible debt during the quarter ended november   partially offset by higher interest income in fiscal as a result of higher levels of invested cash and marketable securities 
the increase in fiscal relates primarily to an increase in interest income due to higher investment levels in fiscal offset by higher interest expense  both as a result of the issuance of million of convertible debt during the quarter ended november  benefit from provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  an income tax provision of million in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the u 
s statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization along with non cash stock compensation benefit expense and impairment loss on the converge  inc investment that did not result in an income tax benefit or expense for financial reporting purposes 
excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles and developed technology  non cash stock compensation benefit  the converge  inc investment impairment  the iri settlement and restructuring costs  our effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal as of february   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal  state and foreign tax purposes of million  in aggregate 
these carryforwards expire in various years between and we recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowances against nols where it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these future tax benefits 
as of february   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company having sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire from to continuing losses for tax purposes combined with a reduction in our anticipated taxable income in future periods could cause a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards to expire with a corresponding loss of the related deferred tax asset 
management believes that an appropriate valuation allowance was recorded at february  based upon the company s estimates 
management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability based on evolving business conditions 
net loss income we reported a net loss of million  million and million for fiscal years ending february or   and  respectively 
the increased net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to amortization of intangibles directly attributable to our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal  the converge  inc investment impairment  the iri settlement  restructuring costs and an increased operating loss excluding non cash charges  offset by the favorable effect of non cash stock compensation benefit expense 
the increased net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the write off of purchased research and development and intangible amortization directly attributable to our acquisitions of talus and stg and charges for non cash stock compensation  offset by an increase in operating income  excluding these non cash items 
adjusted net loss income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
earnings loss per common share earnings loss per common share are computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for entities with complex capital structures 
basic earnings loss per common share is based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings or loss per common share include  when dilutive  i the effect of stock options and warrants granted using the treasury stock method  ii the effect of contingently issuable shares earned during the period  and iii shares issuable under the conversion feature of our convertible notes using the if converted method 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations will be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option and warrant exercises  the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase plan  any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the diluted earnings per common share calculations  the issuance of common stock to effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions  assumed or actual conversions of our convertible debt into common stock  the potential issuance of common stock related to contingent consideration from the stg acquisition see liquidity and capital resources  and the potential issuance of common stock related to the wds acquisition see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flows provided from operations  long term borrowings and sales of equity securities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in aggregate decreased million during fiscal to million as of february  working capital decreased million to million at february  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and working capital resulted primarily from cash payments for the partminer csd  inc and spaceworks  inc 
acquisitions  the converge  inc investment  two semi annual interest payments on our convertible debt  as well as losses from operations and severance and lease payments related to our restructuring plans 
cash flows used in provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the change in operating cash flows of million in fiscal resulted primarily from i the company s operating loss before non cash items in fiscal and ii increased cash paid for interest on our convertible debt offset by increased interest income 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  which is calculated based on our fourth quarter revenue  increased to days as of february  versus days as of february  cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investing activities consist primarily of the sales and purchases of marketable securities  purchases of property and equipment  purchases and capitalization of software and acquisitions and investments in businesses 
sales of marketable securities  net of purchases  were million in fiscal total purchases of property  equipment and software  including capitalized software  were million in fiscal we expect purchases of property and equipment to increase in fiscal as we complete the build out of our new corporate headquarters space 
acquisitions and investments in businesses  net of cash acquired  of million  in aggregate  during fiscal  relate primarily to the partminer csd  inc  and spaceworks  inc 
acquisitions and the converge  inc investment 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from our convertible debt offering in november and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases  partially offset by payments made against our line of credit 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit at february  as of february   we had million in convertible subordinated notes outstanding the notes 
the notes bear interest at per annum  which is payable semi annually 
the notes mature in november and are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
on or after november   we may redeem the notes in whole  or from time to time  in part  at our option 
redemption can be made on at least days notice if the trading price of our common stock for trading days in a period of consecutive days ending on the day prior to the mailing of notice of redemption exceeds of the conversion price of the notes 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of the principal amount  is redemption period redemption price november  through october  november  through october  november  through october  november  through maturity on february   we renewed a one year unsecured revolving credit facility with a commercial bank for million 
under its terms  we may request cash advances  letters of credit  or both 
we may make borrowings under the facility for short term working capital purposes or for acquisitions 
the facility requires us to comply with various operating performance and liquidity covenants  restricts us from declaring or paying cash dividends and limits the size of acquisition related borrowings 
as of february   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under this line primarily to secure our lease obligations for office space 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of february  the following summarizes our lease obligations as of february  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands fiscal year ended february or  thereafter total capital leases    operating leases        total lease obligations        in december  we entered into a ten year lease agreement for a new headquarters facility in rockville  md for approximately  square feet to replace expiring leases in our existing maryland facilities 
this lease was amended in june to add approximately  square feet 
we began moving into our new headquarters space in march and expect to be completely moved into the new space by the end of the second calendar quarter of the operating lease term commenced in may and ends in june we expect to incur an additional million in capital expenditures for leasehold improvements in the new headquarters space during the first half of fiscal we will also procure approximately million of furniture and telecommunications equipment for the new headquarters space under capital lease agreements  of which million has been recorded as of february  we expect to commit to the remaining balance during the first quarter of fiscal details of our capital and operating lease commitments are in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
on january   we acquired stg 
we may be required to make additional contingent payments to the former stockholders of stg of up to million during fiscal if certain revenue based performance criteria are met during the month period ending october  the additional contingent payments  if any  would be payable in cash  or in limited circumstances  in common stock at our sole election 
on april   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of wds for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing 
the remaining purchase price of million is payable in shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination thereof at our election 
we have agreed to register for resale by wds shares of our common stock issued as payment of the purchase price 
if we elect to pay some or all of the remaining purchase price in shares of our common stock  the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the remaining million the negotiated value by the average closing price of our common stock for the two consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the shares becoming registered for resale 
if a registration statement for the shares is not declared effective within days of the filing thereof  we would be required to pay the negotiated value in cash 
if  at the close of the ten trading day period beginning after the registration for resale of the shares becomes effective  the aggregate value of the shares issued to wds the trading value  using the average closing price of our common stock during such ten trading day period the trading price  is less than of the negotiated value  we will be required to pay the difference between the negotiated value and the trading value not to exceed million to wds in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election 
if we elect to pay the difference in shares of our common stock  the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the difference between the negotiated value and the trading value by the trading price 
if  at the close of such ten trading day period  the trading value is more than of the negotiated value  wds will return shares to us in an amount determined in the same manner 
details are included in note subsequent events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in addition  we may make strategic investments in businesses and enter into joint ventures that complement our existing business 
any future acquisition or investment may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent we pay with cash 
we believe that our existing liquidity and expected cash flows from operations will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our potential cash requirements for the stg contingent consideration  the wds acquisition and expected capital expenditures and capital lease obligations for the next twelve months 
however  weakening economic conditions or weakening demand for application software in future periods would negatively impact our future operating results and liquidity 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value 
unless designated as hedges  changes in these fair values will be recorded in the income statement 
fair value changes involving hedges will generally be recorded by offsetting gains and losses on the hedge and on the hedged item  even if the fair value of the hedged item is not otherwise recorded 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas establishes new standards for accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires goodwill and certain intangible assets to remain on the balance sheet and not be amortized 
in addition  sfas requires assembled workforce to be reclassified as goodwill 
on an annual basis  and when there is reason to suspect that their values have been impaired  these assets must be tested for impairment and write downs may be necessary 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of this statement 
sfas will also require recognized intangible assets with finite lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard until its life is determined to no longer be indefinite 
in connection with the goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired at the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption and determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
any impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas and sfas as of march   with the exception of the immediate requirement to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  early adoption and retroactive application of these standards are not permitted 
however  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that was acquired in a business combination initiated after june  is not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations initiated before july  were amortized until february  effective march   we stopped amortizing goodwill  but will continue amortizing other intangible assets with finite lives 
we will perform the initial goodwill impairment test required by sfas during our first quarter of fiscal although we have not yet completed our analysis  we do not expect an impairment loss to be recognized upon the adoption of sfas we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit 
we believe that upon adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas  our amortization of intangibles and acquired technology will decrease to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal before considering the impact of the wds acquisition 
in august the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas but retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for i recognition measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and ii measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board s no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for segments of a business to be disposed of but retains apb s requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of sfas effective march   and do not expect adoption of this standard to have any material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued staff announcement topic no 
d income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which was subsequently incorporated in emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
eitf establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  hotel stays and similar costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
we adopted the guidance effective march  with the resulting effect of increased services revenue and increased operating expenses 
we currently record out of pocket expense reimbursements as a reduction of cost of services 
we will be required to reclassify these amounts to revenue in our comparative financial statements beginning in our first quarter of fiscal application of eitf will not result in any net impact to operating or net income in any past periods or future periods 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may harm our business and prospects and our ability in general to conduct business in the ordinary course 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   and thereafter in the united states and elsewhere in the world have adversely affected many businesses  including the company  in multiple ways 
the national and global responses to these terrorist attacks  some of which are still being formulated  may materially adversely affect us in ways we cannot predict at present 
some of the possible material adverse impacts to our business include  but are not limited to the reduced ability to do business in the ordinary course as it is customarily conducted  resulting from a variety of factors  including changes or disruptions in movement and sourcing of materials  goods and components or the possible interruption in the flow of information or monies  a lengthening of our sales cycles and implementations  which might result from a number of factors  including among others changes in security measures for passenger air travel and reductions in available commercial flights which may make it more difficult for our sales force to schedule face to face meetings with prospects and to negotiate and consummate transactions  increased credit and business risk for customers in industries that were severely impacted by the attacks  including passenger airlines and other travel and hospitality industries  and possible reductions  delays or postponements  in capital expenditures as a result of changes in priorities and approval processes 
as a result of our significant losses in recent fiscal years and significant changes in our products and services  you may have difficulty evaluating our future prospects 
we experienced operational difficulties in fiscal and the first half of fiscal problems with our direct sales operation and intense competition  among other factors  contributed to net losses in fiscal and fiscal and a decline in revenue in fiscal late in our second quarter of fiscal and into our third quarter of fiscal  we again experienced a decline in revenue  due to weakening economic conditions and the affects resulting from the terrorist attacks of september  since april  we enhanced our supply chain optimization products and services  expanded the scope of our product and service offerings to include supplier relationship management  service parts management and pricing and revenue optimization and improved our direct sales organization 
our ability to continue to improve our financial performance and maintain financial stability will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following weakening economic conditions which adversely impacted our operating performance during the quarters ended august  and november  and may continue into the future  slower growth in the markets for srm  scm  pro s pm solutions than expected  our ability to introduce new software products and services to respond to technological and client needs  our ability to manage through difficult economic and political environments  our ability to hire  integrate and deploy our direct sales force effectively  our ability to expand our distribution capability through indirect sales channels  our ability to contain or reduce operating costs without adversely impacting revenue growth  our ability to respond to competitive developments and pricing  and our dependence on our current executive officers and key employees 
if we fail to successfully address these risks and uncertainties  our business could be harmed and we could continue to incur significant losses 
we have experienced significant losses in recent years 
our future results will be adversely affected by several types of non cash charges which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we have recently incurred significant losses  including net losses of million during fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of the wds acquisition in april  we will likely incur a non cash charge in our first quarter of fiscal related to purchased research and development which has not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its current stage of development 
we will incur non cash charges in the future related to the amortization of intangible assets  including acquired technology and non cash stock compensation expenses associated with our acquisition of talus solutions  inc talus 
we will also incur non cash charges related to the amortization of certain intangible assets  including acquired technology  relating to the acquisition of wds  stg holdings  inc  partminer inc 
s csd business and spaceworks inc 
in addition  we have incurred and may in the future incur non cash stock compensation charges related to our stock option repricing 
during fiscal  we announced that we were required to write off our investment in converge  inc  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
we may also incur non cash charges in future periods related to impairments of long lived assets 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will grow or that we will achieve profitability in the future 
our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability will be affected by the other risks and uncertainties described in this section 
our failure to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results fluctuate  and if we fail to meet the expectations of the investment community in any period  our stock price could suffer further significant declines 
our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and have become more difficult to predict since global economic uncertainties and political instability increased in fiscal we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be indicative of future performance 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our quarterly operating results include the following the size  timing and contractual terms of licenses and sales of our products and services  customer financial constraints and credit worthiness  the potentially long and unpredictable sales cycle for our products  technical difficulties in our software that could delay the introduction of new products or increase their costs  introductions of new products or new versions of existing products by us or our competitors  delay or deferral of customer purchases and implementations of our solutions due to weakening economic conditions which adversely impacted our operating performance during the quarters ended august  and november   increased economic uncertainty and political instability world wide following the terrorist attacks which began in the united states on september   changes in prices or the pricing models for our products and services or those of our competitors  changes in the mix of our software  services and support revenue  changes in the mix of software products we sell and related impact on third party royalty payments  changes in the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  and changes in rules relating to revenue recognition or in interpretations of those rules 
due to fluctuations from quarter to quarter  our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  as was the case for the quarter ended august  if this occurs  the price of our common stock could suffer further significant declines 
variations in the time it takes us to license our software may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the time it takes to license our software to prospective clients varies substantially  but typically has ranged historically between four and twelve months 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenue to fluctuate widely from period to period 
because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our software revenue in the last month of a quarter  any delay in the license of our products could cause significant variations in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
these delays have occurred on a number of occasions in the past  including  most recently  in our quarters ended august  and november  furthermore  these fluctuations could cause our operating results to suffer in some future periods because our operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short term and we devote significant time and resources to prospective clients 
the length of our sales cycle depends on a number of factors  including the following the complexities of the srm  scm  pro and s pm problems our solutions address  the breadth of the solution required by the client  including the technical  organizational and geographic scope of the license  the evaluation and approval processes employed by the clients and prospects  the sales channel through which the solution is sold  the economic conditions in the united states and abroad  increased economic uncertainty and political instability world wide following the terrorist attacks which began in the united states on september   and any other delays arising from factors beyond our control 
the size and scope of our largest contracts with clients have increased  which may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
our clients and prospective clients are seeking to solve increasingly complex srm  scm  pro and s pm problems 
further  we are focused on providing more comprehensive solutions for our clients  as opposed to only licensing software 
as the complexities of the problems our clients seek to solve increases  the size and scope of our contracts with clients increase  as evidenced by the increase in the number of software transactions of million or greater in fiscal and we recorded six software transactions of million or greater in fiscal as compared to three and zero software transactions of million or greater in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result  our operating results could fluctuate due to the following factors the complexities of the contracting processes of our clients and prospects  contractual terms may vary widely  which may result in differing methods of accounting for revenue from each contract  the sales cycles related to larger contracts may be longer and subject to greater delays  and losses of  or delays in  concluding larger contracts could have a proportionately greater effect on our revenue for a particular period 
any of these factors could cause our revenue to decline or fluctuate significantly in any quarter and could cause a decline in our stock price 
a portion of our revenue is derived from solution support contracts 
a reduction in the renewal rate of annual support contracts could materially harm our business 
our support revenue includes post contract support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
support revenue as a percentage of total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
support contracts are generally renewable annually at the option of our customers 
in the past  we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts from our customers 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements at historical rates  our support revenues could materially decline and could cause a decline in our stock price 
we have experienced difficulties integrating acquisitions in the past and may experience problems with future acquisitions that could materially harm our business 
acquisitions involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
in connection with any acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will effectively integrate employees  operations  products and systems  realize the expected benefits of the transaction  retain key employees  effectively develop and protect key technologies and proprietary know how  avoid conflicts with our clients and business partners that have commercial relationships or compete with the acquired company  avoid unanticipated operational difficulties or expenditures or both  and effectively operate our existing business lines  given the significant diversion of resources and management attention required to successfully integrate acquisitions 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in a dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share to the extent we issue shares of our common stock as consideration 
this could negatively affect our stock price 
we depend on sales of our srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions  and our business will be materially and adversely affected if the market for our products does not continue to grow 
substantially all of our software  service and support revenue have arisen from  or are related directly to  our srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions 
we expect to continue to be dependent upon these solutions in the future  and any factor adversely affecting the solutions or the markets for srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions  in general  would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
while we believe the markets for srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions will continue to expand  they may grow more slowly than in the past 
if the markets for our solutions do not grow as rapidly as we expect  revenue growth  operating margins  or both  could be adversely affected 
companies are re evaluating their supplier and client relationships and some are adjusting their service levels and other supply chain management settings and levels in a manner that may have an adverse affect on our ability to sell our srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions 
since september   companies are re evaluating the nature of their relationships with suppliers and clients 
some are adjusting their service levels and other supply chain management settings and levels to address risks arising out of the terrorists attacks and the resulting increased economic and political uncertainties in ways that may adversely affect the benefits historically achieved through use of our solutions  which could have a material adverse affect on our ability to market and sell our srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions 
our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased  and we expect it to increase in the future 
our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
some competitors are offering enterprise application software that compete with our applications at no charge as components of bundled products 
further  our current or prospective clients and partners may become competitors in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and the loss of market share 
each of these developments could materially and adversely affect our growth and operating performance 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and therefore  we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other application software vendors including adexa  inc  aspen technology  inc  the descartes systems group inc  global logistics technologies  inc  i technologies  inc  jda software  inc  khimetrics  logility  inc  logisitics 
com  mercia  metreo  pros revenue management  retek  inc  sabre  inc  sap ag  synquest and yieldstar technology 
in addition  some erp companies such as invensys plc which acquired baan company nv  nv edwards company  oracle corporation  peoplesoft  inc and sap ag have acquired or developed and are developing scm  srm  pro and s pm solutions 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly the erp vendors  have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than us  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
some of our competitors are offering enterprise application software at no charge as components of bundled products 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and adversely affect our revenue growth and operating performance 
if the development of our products and services fails to keep pace with our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future results may be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities that meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace  meet changing client requirements  comply with changing industry standards  achieve market acceptance  integrate third party software effectively  and respond to competitive offerings 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we may not possess sufficient resources to continue to make the necessary investments in technology 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software opportunities or develop and bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients  which may adversely affect our performance 
defects in our software or problems in the implementation of our software could lead to claims for damages by our clients  loss of revenue or delays in the market acceptance of our solutions 
our software is complex and is frequently integrated with a wide variety of third party software 
this integration process can be complex  time consuming and expensive and may cause delays in the development of our products 
as a result  some customers may have difficulty or be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
we may license software that contains undetected errors or failures when new software is first introduced or as new versions are released 
we may not discover errors in our software until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases 
these problems may result in claims for damages suffered by our clients  a loss of  or delays in  the market acceptance of our solutions  client dissatisfaction and potentially lost revenue and collection difficulties during the period required to correct these errors 
we are dependent on third party software that we incorporate into and include with our products and solutions  and impaired relations with these third parties  defects in third party software or the inability to enhance their software over time could harm our business 
we incorporate and include third party software into and with our products and solutions 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the software capabilities 
furthermore  it may be difficult for us to replace any third party software if a vendor seeks to terminate our license to the software or ability to license the software to others 
any impairment in our relationship with these third parties could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are substantially dependent on third parties to integrate our software with other software products and platforms 
if any company that we use to integrate our software products should cease to provide integration services to us  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on companies such as acta technology  inc  peregrine systems  inc  vignette corporation  and webmethods  inc 
to integrate our software with software and platforms developed by third parties 
if these companies are unable to develop or maintain software that effectively integrates our software and is free from errors  our ability to license our products and provide solutions could be impaired 
further  we rely on these companies to maintain relationships with the companies that provide the external software that is vital to the functioning of our products and solutions 
the loss of any company that we use to integrate our software products could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our efforts to develop relationships with vendors such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others to implement and promote our software products may fail  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have only recently entered into contracts with governmental agencies 
these contracts often involve long purchase cycles and competitive procurement processes 
if we fail to manage these cycles to timely conclusions  they could have a material adverse affect on our financial performance 
we have recently begun providing our solutions to government agencies and expect that a significant portion of our future revenue may be derived from government agency clients 
our acquisition of wds in april will increase the amount of revenue and customer relationships derived from government agencies 
obtaining government contracts may involve long purchase cycles  competitive bidding  qualification requirements  congressional appropriations  delays in funding  budgetary constraints and extensive specification development and price negotiations 
in order to facilitate the sales of our commercial software and services to the federal government we hold a government services administration federal supply services schedule for information technology it and management organizational and business improvement services mobis 
each government agency maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies 
government agencies also often retain a significant portion of fees payable upon completion of a project and collection of such fees may be delayed for several months 
accordingly  our revenue could decline as a result of these government procurement processes 
government agencies also may require us to reimburse the government for the difference in prices they paid for our products if we subsequently sell the same products at discounts to other customers 
in addition  it is possible that  in the future  some of our government contracts may be fixed price contracts which may prevent us from recovering costs incurred in excess of our budgeted costs 
fixed price contracts may require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project s requirements 
the financial viability of any given project depends in large part on our ability to estimate such costs accurately and to complete the project on a timely basis 
in the event our actual costs exceed the fixed contract cost  we will not be able to recover the excess costs 
if we fail to properly anticipate costs on fixed price contracts  our profit margins will decrease 
some government contracts are also subject to termination or re negotiation at the convenience of the government  which could result in a large decline in revenue in any given quarter 
multi year contracts are contingent on overall budget approval by congress and may be terminated due to lack of funds 
increased sales through indirect channels may adversely affect our operating performance 
even if our marketing efforts through indirect channels are successful and result in increased sales  our average selling prices and operating margins could be adversely affected because of the lower unit prices that we receive when selling through indirect channels 
if we fail to field an effective sales organization  our ability to grow will be limited  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have recently reduced our sales force as a result of global economic uncertainties and political instability 
in order to grow our revenue  our existing sales force will have to be more productive and we will have to expand our sales force in future periods 
our past efforts to expand our sales organization have required significant resources 
new sales personnel require training and may take a long time to achieve full productivity 
there is no assurance that we can attract and retain qualified sales people at levels sufficient to support our growth 
any failure to adequately sell our products could limit our growth and adversely affect our financial performance 
the limited ability of legal protections to safeguard our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
the number of intellectual property claims in our industry may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in recent years  there has been a tendency by software companies to file substantially increasing numbers of patent applications  including those for business methods and processes 
we have no way of knowing what patent applications third parties have filed until the application is filed or until a patent is issued 
patent applications are often published within months of filing but it can take as long as three years or more for a patent to be granted after an application has been filed 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our international operations pose risks for our business and financial condition 
we currently conduct operations in a number of countries around the world 
these operations require significant management attention and financial resources and subject us to risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles  foreign currency risk  legal uncertainties regarding liability  ownership and protection of intellectual property  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  potentially adverse tax consequences  and increased economic uncertainty and political instability following the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
changes in the value of the us dollar  as compared to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating results 
in fiscal  of our total revenue was derived from outside the united states 
our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  typically the local currency of the selling business unit 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
as our international operations expand  we expect to use an increasing number of foreign currencies  causing our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations to increase 
we generally do not implement hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable  cash balances and intercompany accounts  and we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenues and expenses and other commitments 
for the foregoing reasons  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and likely will continue to cause  variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we lose our key personnel  the success and growth of our business may suffer 
our success depends significantly on the continued service of our executive officers 
we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our executive officers  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on our executive officers 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
the failure to hire and retain qualified personnel would harm our business 
we believe that our success also will depend significantly on our ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and services personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate profitably 
in addition  the cost of hiring and retaining skilled employees is high  and this reduces our profitability 
failure to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
an important component of our employee compensation is stock options 
a decline in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  as it has in the past 
expenses arising from our prior stock option repricing may have a material adverse impact on future performance 
in response to the poor performance of our stock price between may and january  the prior executive management team offered to reprice employee stock options  other than those held by our executive officers or directors  effective january   to bolster employee retention 
as a result of our offer  options to acquire approximately million shares were repriced  of which options to purchase a total of approximately million shares are currently outstanding as of february  in addition  the four year vesting period of the repriced options started over 
the recently adopted fasb interpretation no 
of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  requires us to record compensation expense or benefit associated with the change in the market price of these options 
the changes in our common stock market price since the fasb mandated measurement date of july  resulted in a non cash stock benefit of million during fiscal and an expense of million being recorded in fiscal in each future quarter  we will record the additional expense or benefit related to the repriced stock options still outstanding  to the extent that our stock price is greater than  based on the change in our common stock price as compared to the measurement date 
as a result  the repricing may continue to have a material adverse impact on reported financial results and could therefore negatively affect our stock price 
we may be subject to future liability claims  and our company s and products reputation may suffer 
many of our implementations involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
any failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into agreements with software vendors  consulting firms  resellers and others whereby they market our solutions 
if these vendors fail to meet their clients expectations or cause failures in their clients systems  the reputation of our company and products could be materially and adversely affected even if our software products perform in accordance with their functional specifications 
risks related to our industry lack of growth or decline in internet usage could be detrimental to our future operating results 
the growth of the internet has increased demand for epo  srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions  as well as created markets for new and enhanced product offerings 
therefore  our future sales and profits are substantially dependent upon the internet as a viable commercial medium 
the continued success of the internet as a viable commercial medium may be adversely affected for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  concerns that may develop among businesses and consumers about accessibility  security  reliability  cost  ease of use and quality of service  increased taxation and governmental regulation  or changes in  or insufficient availability of  communications services to support the internet  resulting in slower internet user response times 
the occurrence of any of these factors could require us to modify our technology and our business strategy 
any such modifications could require us to expend significant amounts of resources 
in the event that the internet does not remain a viable commercial medium  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
new laws or regulations affecting the internet or commerce in general could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our growth 
congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have adopted and are considering legislation affecting the use of the internet  including laws relating to the use of the internet for commerce and distribution 
the adoption or interpretation of laws regulating the internet  or of existing laws governing such things as consumer protection  libel  property rights and personal privacy  could hamper the growth of the internet and its use as a communications and commercial medium 
if this occurs  companies may decide not to use our products or services  and our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
in november  we completed a convertible debt offering of million in subordinated convertible notes that are due november our indebtedness could have important consequences for investors 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of capital to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
neither the terms of our credit facility nor the terms of the notes fully prohibit us from doing so 
if a significant amount of new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on the notes and to conduct our business operations 
we have net losses  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  weakening economic conditions  increased economic and political uncertainty following the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the market for epo  srm  scm  pro and s pm solutions  changes in the performance and or market valuations of our current and potential competitors and the software industry in general  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding our competitors  including their products and implementation efforts  additions or departures of key personnel  our sales or anticipated sales of additional equity securities  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  the nasdaq national market and the equity markets for software companies in particular  have recently experienced extraordinary price and volume volatility in recent years 
such volatility has adversely affected the stock prices for many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely further affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
scheduled sales of significant amounts of our common stock by our executive officers may cause our stock price to decline 
certain of our executive officers have entered into pre established trading plans pursuant to which they sold a total of approximately  shares of our common stock in january  approximately  shares in april  approximately  shares in the three months ended august  commencing in september  some of these executive officers terminated their trading plans 
approximately  shares were sold under the remaining plans in the three months ended february  our executive officers who presently maintain trading plans are scheduled to sell shares in future quarters  subject to the terms of their trading plans  which terms include price floors below which no shares or a reduced amount of shares will be sold 
the quarterly sales will continue until the trading plans are modified or terminated 
certain of our other executive officers and directors may establish similar plans to sell shares on a quarterly basis 
the sale of these shares may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our charter and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover even if beneficial to stockholders 
our charter and our bylaws  in conjunction with delaware law  contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
for example  our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors and allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
furthermore  our board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate the voting rights  dividend rate and privileges of the preferred stock all of which may be greater than the rights of common stockholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
foreign currency risk 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
such changes could result in cumulative translation gains or losses that are included in shareholders equity 
revenue outside of the united states was  and in fiscal  and  respectively  derived from operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  netherlands  singapore  spain  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries result in positive or negative fluctuations in the amounts relating to foreign operations reported in our consolidated financial statements 
none of the components of our financial statements were materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal  and we generally do not use foreign currency options and forward contracts to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
while we do not expect to incur material losses as a result of this currency risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result 
interest rate risk 
our marketable securities and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national  state and local governments and agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair market value of marketable securities held was million at february  and million at february  we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term deposits of the local bank 
such operating cash balances held at banks outside of the united states are denominated in the local currency 
the united states federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest 
during calendar  the federal reserve board decreased the federal funds rate several times  by basis points  to 
these actions have led to a general market decline in interest rates during calendar the weighted average yield on interest bearing investments held as of february  and was approximately and  respectively 
based on our investment holdings at february   a basis point decline in the average yield would reduce our annual interest income by million 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support clients receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry and no single customer accounts for more than our consolidated revenue 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
