item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  long term service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sou rces 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts  including billed retainages  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
the company also provides for reserves on revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages on long term contracts 
because of the nature of its customers  which are predominantly governmental entities  the company does not generally incur losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
alternatively  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services provided and request a reduction to the aggregate contract price 
while the company engages in extensive product and service quality programs and processes  the company s allowances for such contract price reductions are continually monitored by management 
in connection with its customer contracts and the related adequacy of its reserves and measures of progress towards completi on  the company s project managers are charged with the responsibility of continually reviewing the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
in addition  management reviews on a quarterly basis significant past due account receivables and the related adequacy of the company s reserves 
for software arrangements that include customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  the company recognizes revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  the company performs additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee  to satisfy the customers expectations 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions such as the type just described as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to future profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision first become known 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets annually to determine if they may be impaired 
if the carrying amounts of the assets are not recoverable based upon undiscounted cash flow analysis  they are reduced by the estimated shortfall of fair value compared to the recorded value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues of  and  for the three and twelve months ended april   were comparable to the net revenues of  and  that were reported for the three and twelve months ended april  however  the prior year three and twelve month revenues included  and  respectively  of non recurring retention revenue associated with allegheny county pittsburgh described below 
when these amounts are excluded  net revenues actually increased by and for the three and twelve months ended april   respectively  over the prior year comparable periods 
net revenues generally include software license fees  hardware sales  forms and supplies sales  and various related services  such as mass real estate appraisals revaluations  software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance  forms processing and printing 
excluding the  and  of retention revenue noted above  appraisal service segment net revenues have decreased by approximately and for the three and twelve months ended april   in comparison to the three and twelve months ended april  the allegheny county project accounted for of the appraisal service segment s net revenues for the year ended april  in comparison to for the year ended april  the company s backlog for appraisal services at april   decreased by approximately million to million compared to approximately million at april  both the decrease in current year revenues and backlog are due primarily to the wind down of the million allegheny county contract and the cyclical nature of this business 
in particular  the ohio market is on a six year cycle and the allegheny county project was an unusually large and non recurring contract 
while the company has been actively pursuing new business to replenish the backlog for appraisal services  its efforts are being confined to its traditional markets in ohio  indiana  and pennsylvania where it has historically had a more profitable execution rate 
as noted in the prior year  the company had reserved of retainage revenue related to the allegheny county appraisal project and of the retainage revenue on all other appraisal service projects due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding their ultimate collection associated with the political nature of this segment 
typically  the end result of appraisal service contracts is increased property valuations and taxes for many county constituents  which results in additional work on the back end of these contracts to defend challenged values 
during the three and twelve months ended april   the company collected and recognized approximately  and  respectively  of retention revenue on the allegheny county project 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under all appraisal service projects including allegheny county was approximately  and  respectively 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under the allegheny county project was approximately  and  respectively 
the company continues to believe it is appropriate to reserve of the remaining unpaid allegheny retention as well as certain other monies due for the performance of services since certain officials at allegheny county have continually contested the payment of such amounts and their ultimate collection is pending an order from the judge who initially ordered the reassessment 
software systems and services segment revenues increased by approximately and for the three and twelve months ended april   versus the prior year comparable periods 
this growth is primarily attributable to the execution of a number of new mvp tax and mvp tax manager software contracts in the florida  indiana  and ohio regions as well as a number of new proval contract executions in the indiana region 
in addition  overall business has picked up given that the prior year was negatively impacted by the national election and the post yk slowdown 
cost of revenues of  for the three months ended april  decreased compared to  for the three months ended april  annual cost of revenues decreased by from  in the prior fiscal year to  for the year ended april  these decreases are primarily due to the reduction in appraisal service revenues noted above 
cost of revenues for the current year were adversely effected by approximately million due to a number of appraisal service contracts in the northeast that were not completed on time or on budget 
however  there still was an improvement in gross margins for both the three and twelve month periods ended april  over the comparable prior year periods  when the impact of the allegheny retention revenue mentioned above is excluded  as the costs associated with these revenues were incurred in prior periods 
this is due to a favorable shift in the mix of revenues from appraisal services to software and services 
software license fees typically yield a higher gross margin than appraisal services revenues and have become a larger portion of total revenues  year over year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses have increased by approximately to  for the three months ended april  compared to  for the three months ended april  selling  general  and administrative expenses have increased from  for the twelve months ended april  to  for the twelve months ended april  these increases are primarly due to increases in workers compensation premiums  salary increases  a ramp up in sales and marketing activities and higher sales commissions over the prior year comparable period 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported substantial improvements in its operating income 
excluding the impact of the retention revenue noted above  operating income increased  for the three months and  for the twelve months ended april  net interest income for the twelve months ended april   was approximately  compared to net interest expense of  for the twelve months ended april  this improvement is directly related to the reduction in the company s bank borrowings and increase in cash balances 
the company s provision for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate for both the three and twelve month periods ended april  was approximately 
this effective tax rate is substantially higher than the statutory rate of primarily because of the large amount of non deductible goodwill amortization related to certain of the company s acquisitions relative to the level of pretax income 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported a  increase in its net income to  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april   compared to  or 
per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year 
in addition  the company reported a  increase in its net income of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april   versus a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april  diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by approximately  shares for the twelve months ended april   compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the fact that potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculations in the prior year due to the net loss that was reported 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues of  for the three months ended april   increased over the net revenues of  that were reported for the fourth quarter in fiscal net revenues of  for the twelve months ended april   were lower than the  of net revenues that were reported for the twelve months ended april  the components of revenues were essentially the same as noted for fiscal excluding the allegheny county retention revenue discussed below  appraisal service segment revenues decreased by approximately and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended april   in comparison to the three and twelve months ended april  these decreases were primarily attributed to the cyclical nature of the appraisal services market and the wind down of the allegheny county project  which was substantially completed as of april  the allegheny project accounted for of the company s net revenues for the year ended april  in comparison to for the year ended april  in addition  the company had a few jobs on the east coast that were behind schedule and  accordingly  the related revenues were lower than initially anticipated 
the company s backlog for appraisal services at april   decreased by approximately million to million compared to approximately million at april  as noted previously  the company had reserved of retainage revenue related to the allegheny county appraisal project and of the retainage revenue on all other appraisal service projects due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimating the percentage of completion on these projects and the uncertainty regarding their ultimate collection 
during the three and twelve months ended april   the company collected and recognized approximately  and  respectively  of retention revenue on the allegheny county project 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under all appraisal service projects including allegheny county was  and  respectively 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under the allegheny county project was  and  respectively 
software systems and services segment revenues increased by approximately for the three months ended april  versus the fiscal comparable quarter  however  they were flat for the year ended april  in comparison with fiscal the growth in the fourth quarter was attributed to the execution of various mvp tax contracts in indiana 
revenues associated with hardware and software sales declined in aggregate over the prior year due to a significant reduction in new sales due to the fact that was an election year for many of our customers 
in addition  many local government officials scaled back their systems spending following all of the yk upgrades that took place in the prior year 
growth in recurring software support  primarily attributable to the cps acquisition  allowed the company s revenues to remain comparable overall with prior year revenue levels 
cost of revenues of  for the three months ended april   increased compared to  for the three months ended april  annual cost of revenues decreased by from  in fiscal to  for the year ended april  these changes were primarily due to the movement in net revenues noted above 
margins between years were comparable at 
however  when you exclude the  of retention revenue recognized during the three months ended april   and  of retention revenue recognized during the year ended april   gross margin declined by approximately to approximately for both the three and twelve months ended april  this decrease was primarily related to the fixed nature of labor costs  which do not fluctuate immediately with declined revenue levels 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately to  for the three months ended april  compared to  for the three months ended april  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased from  for the twelve months ended april  to  for the twelve months ended april  these increases were due to a full year of goodwill amortization and overhead costs associated with the cps systems acquisition  significant investments in research and development  a decreasing trend in capitalized software development costs and increased sales and marketing activities 
also  manatron experienced higher personnel related costs in the fourth quarter because of a number of new hires to handle the additional software business and higher than usual workers compensation and health insurance expenses  which manatron partially self funds 
the amount of software capitalized declined by from approximately  to  for the years ended april  and  respectively 
finally  deferred compensation expense increased from approximately  to  for the twelve months ended april   as a result of restricted stock grants in fiscal  including those associated with the manatron  inc executive stock plan of  which was approved at the annual shareholders meeting 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported slightly lower operating income of  for the three months ended april   versus operating income of  for the three months ended april  for the year ended april  a net operating loss of  was reported versus operating income of  for fiscal interest expense increased from  for the year ended april  to  for the year ended april  due to the use of cash and debt required to fund operations in fiscal  the acquisitions of cps systems  inc and proval corporation  and the purchase of a new corporate office building in fiscal as noted previously  the company s provision for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
in addition  the effective tax rate generally is impacted because of non deductible goodwill amortization related to the company s acquisitions 
however  in fiscal  the company recorded a credit for federal taxes of  due to the net loss position for that year 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported a decrease in its net income to  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april   versus income of  or 
per diluted share for the comparable period in the fiscal in addition  the company reported a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april   versus income of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april  quarterly results the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the last eight quarters fiscal fiscal july  october  january  april  july  october  january  april  net revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share ebitda cash and equivalents financial condition and liquidity working capital of  at april   has increased by compared to the  that was reported at april  these levels reflect current ratios of and  respectively 
the improvement in both working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to an increase in cash flows from operations  which was utilized to repay all bank borrowings 
shareholders equity at april   increased by  to  from the balance reported at april  this was due to  of net income   of employee stock purchases   of stock issued to the k plan see note   of deferred compensation expense and  of stock issued or to be issued in connection with the post merger earn out agreement related to the proval acquisition see note for the year ended april  as a result  book value per share increased to as of april   from at april  the nature of the company s business is generally not property or equipment intensive 
net capital expenditures of approximately  for the year ended april   were higher than the prior year amount of  primarily because the company s cash flow position was substantially improved in fiscal several new employees were hired who needed equipment and many existing employees received upgrades or new equipment 
current year and prior year expenditures relate primarily to the purchase of computer hardware and software for the company s technical and support personnel 
since the company s revenues are generated from contracts with local governmental entities  it is not uncommon for certain of its accounts receivable to remain outstanding for approximately three to four months  thereby having a negative impact upon cash flow 
the company currently has a secured line of credit agreement with comerica bank at the prime rate of interest less 
up to million 
borrowings under this agreement are contingent on meeting certain funded debt to ebitda levels 
as of april   the company was eligible for the full million of borrowings 
in addition  the company had a million installment note with required monthly payments of  commencing january   at the prime rate of interest less 
as of april   the company had no borrowings outstanding under its million line of credit and had fully repaid the installment note payable prior to its maturity 
the company anticipates that the line of credit  tog ether with existing cash balances  and cash generated from future operations will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company cannot determine precisely the effect of inflation on its business 
the company continues  however  to experience relatively stable costs for its inventory and equipment as the computer hardware market is very competitive 
the company anticipates that inflationary price increases related to labor and overhead will have a negative effect on cash flow and net income to the extent that the increases cannot be offset through improved productivity and price increases
