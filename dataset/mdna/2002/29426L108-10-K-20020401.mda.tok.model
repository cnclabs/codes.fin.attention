the company s accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements is fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers many factors when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america related to revenue recognition 
these factors include  but are not limited to the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates  and pricing of the various product and service elements of a contract availability of products to be delivered time period over which services are to be performed creditworthiness of the customer the complexity of customizations to the company s software required by service contracts the sales channel through which the sale is made direct  var  distributor  etc 
discounts given for each element of a contract any commitments made as to installation or implementation go live dates each of the relevant factors is analyzed to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer

capitalized software development costs software development costs incurred subsequent to the determination of technological feasibility and marketability of a software product are capitalized 
amortization of capitalized software development costs commences when the products are available for general release

in addition to in house software development costs  the company purchases certain software from third party software providers and capitalizes such costs in software development costs 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of its capitalized software development costs and considers any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
any material changes in circumstances  such as a large decrease in revenues or the discontinuation of a particular product line could require future write downs in the company s capitalized software development costs and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur

for the year ended december   the company capitalized million of software development costs 
for the year ended december   no software development costs were capitalized because the time period between technological feasibility and general release decreased significantly compared to prior years  such that for all software product releases during that time period was insignificant 
capitalized software development costs include both internally generated development costs for development of the company s future product releases and third party development costs related to the localization and translation of certain of the company s products for foreign markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents 
at december  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s interest expense associated with its term loan and revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
the company had approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon these variable rate debt levels  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
foreign currency risk 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  canada and australia 
the company does not have any hedging or similar foreign currency contracts 
international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
significant currency fluctuations may adversely impact foreign revenues 
however  the company does not foresee or expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future
