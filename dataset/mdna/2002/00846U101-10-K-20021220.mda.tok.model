item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements regarding our liquidity position and our expected overall growth  the material impact from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements  our financial results  the impact of the enterprise resource planning implementation  savings from restructuring programs  the length of the economic downturn  trends and growth in the markets we sell into  the anticipated completion of transactions and contracts  new product introductions and changes to our manufacturing process that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed below in factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview agilent technologies  inc we  agilent or the company  incorporated in delaware in may  is a global diversified technology organization that provides enabling solutions to technology markets within the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
prior to our initial public offering of percent of our stock in november  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hewlett packard company hewlett packard 
hewlett packard distributed the remaining percent of our stock to its stockholders on june  in the form of a stock dividend 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
reclassifications amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended october  and october  have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue is recognized on a sale to a customer only after the product or service has been delivered or installed and accepted by the customer 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and distributor price protection  when appropriate 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and do not record revenue on sales if collection is not reasonably assured 
most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we accrue for restructuring costs when management approves and commits to a firm plan 
the three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments  primarily property  plant and equipment 
workforce 
table of contents related charges are accrued based on an estimate of expected benefits that will be paid out to the employees 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements  net of estimated future sublease income 
asset impairment charges are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected sales or disposals of buildings and equipment that we currently use in manufacturing  research and development and support 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab  and emerging issues task force no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

if the amounts and timing are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount could be materially different  either higher or lower  than what we have recorded 
however  as of october  and the date of this filing  we believe our estimates remain materially correct 
beginning january   we will follow new guidance provided in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

see new accounting pronouncements below 
we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make under current volatile economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account recent sales forecasts  projected obsolescence and our current inventory levels 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher earnings from operations than expected in that period 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of october   the expected long term rate of return in the us was percent  and ranged from to percent for our plans outside the us we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the us and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would result in increased pension expense of million for in the us and million for for all plans outside the us pension expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note  retirement plans and post retirement benefits in item of this report for the full list of assumptions 
we have assessed the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash 
table of contents flows according to the guidance of sfas no 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
beginning november   we will use the new guidance provided in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

see new accounting pronouncements below 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
as of october   a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not deemed necessary 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
we continually evaluate strategies that would allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets and currently believe we have the ability to enact strategies to fully realize our deferred tax assets should our earnings in future periods not support the full realization of the deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on a portion of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of october  because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
if management decides to remit these earnings to the us in a future period  our provision for taxes may increase materially in that period 
cyclical business and general economic conditions the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor market  electronics industry  computer industry and telecommunications markets  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 
in  an economic downturn reduced consumer and capital spending in many of the worldwide markets that we serve 
this economic downturn has continued in it also has created an imbalance of supply and demand in the wireless and semiconductor manufacturing industries 
in  net revenue was down percent compared to  and we incurred a net loss of  million compared to net earnings of million in in  loss from continuing operations increased percent compared to in  net revenue and net earnings were down percent and percent  respectively  compared to our earnings from continuing operations in declined percent to a loss from continuing operations in substantially all of the impacts of this decline occurred in our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses 
wireline telecommunication markets within our test and measurement group continue to decline and a recovery in these markets is not expected for some time 
additionally  as a capital equipment provider  our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers  who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 
we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future 
given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed  variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results 
restructuring and asset impairment summary we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan after it 
table of contents became clear that the actions taken in the previous year would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
both plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability without relying on an improvement in economic conditions 
to date we have achieved savings of approximately million per quarter  principally through reducing our workforce by  people 
actions have been focused on segments that were impacted most severely by the changing environment our test and measurement and semiconductor products groups but actions were also taken to reduce the costs associated with support services such as finance and administration 
cost reductions were initiated by reducing the number of properties  particularly sales and administrative sites  and by reducing our workforce within the impacted segments 
our plan was substantially complete as of october  the plan is still being implemented we expect to complete it no later than the first quarter of we anticipate that we will save an additional million per quarter by mid as a result of the plan 
the plan in  as a result of the economic downturn that impacted many of the markets that we serve  we took steps to restructure our businesses 
on august   we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately  or about nine percent  by the middle of on november   we enhanced and supplemented our plan by announcing a further reduction of  jobs once we had determined that the actions contemplated in august would not be sufficient to return us to profitability 
together these actions form the plan  which was designed to reduce costs across almost all of our administrative and support services  including sales and marketing  and to focus our production activities on those products that we believed would return us to profitability  such as those in life sciences  semiconductor test and wireless telecommunications 
our plan impacted the test and measurement group and the semiconductor products group and had little direct impact on the life sciences and chemical analysis group except as the plan related to support services reductions across all of our businesses 
within the test and measurement segment  we reduced production capacity dramatically for communications test product lines and reduced production to some degree in general purpose and semiconductor test product lines 
within the semiconductor products segment we reduced production capacity significantly for product lines in networking  especially long haul networks  and reduced production capacity for some personal systems products 
the plan was substantially complete as of october   although we will continue to make lease payments on a number of properties vacated as a result of this plan through at least the next years 
a summary of restructuring activity for the plan through october  is shown in the table below impairment of consolidation assets  workforce of excess property  plant reduction facilities and equipment total in millions beginning balance at july  total charge cash payments ending balance at october  total charge asset impairment cash payments ending balance at october  
table of contents the three main components of the plan relate to workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
workforce related charges were incurred as a result of the  person workforce reduction  the cuts impacted all regions  all expense categories and most of our segments 
research and development activities were terminated on some product development initiatives  none of which were individually or in total significant to our future revenues or profitability 
we also took action to reduce the number of employees at production facilities that had experienced declining demand  such as those making equipment for the long haul wireline business 
our plan to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements 
we have exited  or plan to exit in the near future  more than production  support and sales facilities  or parts of facilities  across all regions  particularly in the us and japan  representing more than million square feet  or about percent  of our worldwide property 
as of october   we have vacated approximately percent of these facilities 
the decision to exit individual facilities was made as a result of specific economic conditions in certain countries and as part of our strategy to centralize support services and to consolidate facilities 
we lease most of these buildings from third parties  and the closures impacted all three of our segments 
in most cases  we are exiting office space housing sales and administrative employees 
however  a small number of production facilities were closed as a result of our plans to consolidate manufacturing into fewer sites 
asset impairment charges relate to fixed assets and were determined using estimates of the expected future cash flows generated from those assets 
impairments were recorded for machinery and equipment in production facilities that we were closing or scaling back  such as for the long haul wireline business and for leasehold improvements in leased facilities that we planned to exit 
one production facility in kobe  japan accounted for approximately million of the million of asset impairment charges in in order to determine the amount of the impairment  under the held for use model in accordance with sfas no 
 we estimated the cash flows that would result from our continued use of the building until we expect to vacate it and also estimated the sales proceeds that we expected to be able to realize 
the resulting impairment was approximately percent of the net book value of the facility  primarily due to the decline in the local property market 
we have incurred million of expenses for the plan through october  million in and million in the most significant revision to the plan was made in the fourth quarter of  after updating our lease termination costs and sub lease income assumptions as the real estate leasing market continued to decline  adding a number of leased sales offices and two owned production facilities to the list that we were planning to exit  including the facility in kobe  japan  described above  we incurred incremental asset impairment costs of million and lease facility costs of million in relation to these changes 
we have reduced our workforce by approximately  approximately  from involuntary terminations and approximately  from net attrition as of october  and believe we have achieved collective savings of approximately million in from the restructuring efforts 
restructuring savings were million in cost of sales  million in research and development and million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we paid approximately million in cash for severance payments in the cash payments were funded using cash generated from operations  existing working capital and credit facilities  where necessary 
we expect that future savings of approximately billion per annum will be achieved in total among all types of expenses cost of products and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative 
savings are expected to be realized from the reductions in salary and benefit expenses  reduction in rent and other facilities costs and from savings associated with materials and supplies 
we expect the restructuring plan to have a positive impact on our liquidity in  as the savings generated are predominantly cash 

table of contents the plan on august   we announced our intention to further reduce our operational costs by million per quarter so that we might reach profitability at target revenue levels of billion per quarter 
we concluded that we must further reduce our breakeven point given our current level of revenues because the wireline and communications markets are recovering more slowly than we anticipated 
this plan primarily affects the manufacturing and field operations serving the wireline markets that are components of our test and measurement group 
a summary of restructuring activity for the plan through october  is shown in the table below impairment of assets  workforce property  plant reduction and equipment total in millions beginning balance at july  total charge asset impairment cash payments ending balance at october  as part of the plan we have reduced our workforce by approximately as of october   but collective savings were insignificant in because the plan implementation began late in the fourth quarter of we expect to reduce our workforce by  in total by the time the plan is completed 
we expect to achieve the majority of the million reduction in quarterly operational costs by mid asset impairment charges of million relate to machinery and equipment  primarily owned by the semiconductor products group in singapore 
the equipment had been purchased in support of communications research but as a result of our restructuring plans we have decided to sell the equipment and conduct the research using existing equipment in the us a summary of the income statement impact of the combined plans in and is shown below 
there were no significant restructuring activities in years ended october  in millions cost of products and services research and development selling  general and administrative total restructuring and asset impairment charges other asset impairment charges in june  we recognized a million asset impairment charge with respect to our decision to cancel the development of a software system for our customer support activities 
we entered into an agreement with hewlett packard to extend our use of their legacy customer support systems in place of the one that we were developing 
in  we began to develop a new customer relationship management crm system independent from hewlett packard 
we expect the crm to be initially implemented in the first quarter of 
table of contents adoption of new accounting standards in july  we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
effective november   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  and requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carried at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings or stockholders equity  depending on the intended use of the instrument 
the adoption of sfas no 
in november resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of million million after tax primarily relating to the valuation of warrants to purchase securities and a pre tax increase in other comprehensive income of million 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted sab retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year 
the cumulative effect of the adoption  reflecting the deferral of net revenue and cost of products from october   resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of million million after tax 
as a result of adopting sab  delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
for the fiscal year ended october   the net impact on net revenue  including amounts deferred at october   was an increase of million of net revenue and million of cost of products which were included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
the results for the first three quarters of have been restated in accordance with sab pro forma amounts for the year ended october  have not been presented  as the effect of the change could not be reasonably determined 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
under which goodwill will no longer be amortized but reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on november  subsequently  we are required to evaluate our existing goodwill and intangible assets and make any necessary reclassification in order to comply with the new criteria in sfas no 
based on our assessment  effective in the first quarter of  approximately million of intangible assets associated with workforce in place will be reclassified to goodwill 
as part of our assessment  we used the fair value measurement requirement  rather than the previously required undiscounted cash flows approach  and as a result we expect to record a transitional impairment loss from the implementation of sfas no 
as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the fair value of the reporting units was determined primarily by the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows 
the first step evaluation of reporting units on a fair value basis  as required by sfas no 
 indicated that an impairment exists in the communications solutions reporting unit within our test and measurement business 
the revenue forecasts of the communications solutions reporting unit have been impacted by the prolonged economic downturn in the communications test markets 
we were required to perform the second step analysis to determine the amount of the impairment loss for the reporting unit that failed the first step test 
the second step analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill  with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the 
table of contents reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
based upon this evaluation  the pre tax impairment is expected to be million  approximately percent of total consolidated goodwill recorded as of october  the adoption of sfas no 
is also expected to have a material impact on our results of operations because goodwill will no longer be amortized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
amortization of goodwill was million in  million in and million in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we do not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which nullifies eitf no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for restructuring costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
sfas no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the effect of adoption is dependent on the timing of our related restructuring activities  however  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
acquisitions on january   we acquired objective systems integrators  inc osi for approximately million 
of this total  million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted 
using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations apb no 
 the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets including goodwill 
the original goodwill balance of million was being amortized over three years 
the net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition at october  was million 
at the time of acquisition  osi was a leading provider of next generation operations support system software for communications service providers and has become part of our test and measurement business 
in july  hewlett packard entered into an agreement with yokogawa electric corporation yokogawa to acquire yokogawa s percent equity interest in agilent technologies japan  ltd 
for approximately million the yokogawa purchase 
the acquisition was done in several steps 
in the initial step  which occurred in january  we purchased approximately percent of agilent technologies japan  ltd 
shares from yokogawa for approximately million 
in the second step  which occurred in april  we purchased approximately percent of additional agilent technologies japan  ltd 
shares from yokogawa for approximately million 
in january  we completed the yokogawa purchase by purchasing the remaining percent interest for approximately million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to tangible assets and million was attributed to goodwill and was being amortized over ten years 
the remaining net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition was million at october  in addition to the osi acquisition and the yokogawa purchase  we acquired several other companies during  and  which were not significant to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as defined in apb no 
or sfas no 
depending on the date of acquisition 
the results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible assets and 
table of contents liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on fair values at the date of acquisition 
residual amounts were recorded as goodwill 
in process research and development write offs have not been significant 
unaudited pro forma statement of operations information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or an aggregated basis 
the net book value of goodwill was million at october  and million at october  goodwill related to acquisitions completed prior to june  was amortized over periods ranging from three to ten years 
effective in the first quarter of  goodwill will no longer be amortized  in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
the aggregate amount of goodwill impairment losses was million in  million in and insignificant in see further discussion in new accounting pronouncements above 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was million in  million in and million in the carrying amount of purchased intangibles was million as of october  effective in the first quarter of  approximately million of workforce in place will be reclassified from intangible assets to goodwill 
the remaining intangible assets of million will be amortized as follows million in and million in discontinued operations on august   we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to koninklijke philips electronics  nv philips pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for a total purchase price of billion 
philips paid initial proceeds of billion to us on august   with further payments following pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement dated as of november   as amended and supplemented by the amendment and supplemental agreement  dated as of august  collectively  the asset purchase agreement 
the total purchase price was subject to adjustment based on the determination of the final purchased net assets and on our performance of integration services for philips 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our healthcare solutions business as discontinued operations in accordance with apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 

the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our healthcare solutions business have been classified as discontinued and prior periods have been restated  including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining business segments 
we recorded an after tax gain of million in and an after tax loss of million in as a result of the sale to philips 
in  adjustments were made to the gain as a result of purchase price adjustments to reflect the final purchased net assets and additional costs that were not anticipated at the time of the sale 
we signed an agreement with philips  dated as of may   finalizing the purchase price adjustments from the sale 
the adjustments did not result in a material adjustment to the gain on sale 
since august   we received all of the million withheld by philips from the total purchase price at the time of the sale plus adjustments for the final purchased net assets 
for incremental fees  we provided support services to philips after august  and a portion of these fees offset costs that include an element of fixed costs which are recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses in and as of october   we have completed our contractual obligation to provide services to philips 
under the asset purchase agreement  we are restricted from competing in the development  manufacturing  selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years after the sale 
we do not expect any material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from this non compete agreement because we do not intend to engage in those specified businesses 

table of contents asset sales sale of leasing portfolio in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with cit group inc cit  formerly tyco capital corporation pursuant to which we sold them substantially all of our leasing portfolio the cit group sale over the course of and there was no impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations for the cit group sale in the impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations of the cit group sale in the previous two years is shown below 
year ended year ended october  october  in millions net proceeds from the cit group sale product revenue cost of products we also entered into a vendor financing arrangement with cit whereby cit will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis 
this agreement has been in place since the fourth quarter of in addition to the cit group sale and the sale of the healthcare solutions business  we sold assets related to portions of our businesses to third parties during  and gross proceeds from these dispositions were million in  million in and insignificant in gains from the dispositions  included in other income expense  net  in the consolidated statement of operations  were million in  million in and insignificant in sale of san jose land in february  we sold a parcel of surplus land in san jose  california for million in cash  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in august  we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern california for a total value of million 
in  we received million in non refundable prepaid rent related to the investment in leaseholds as described above 
foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program  which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our operations in the periods presented 
effective november   we have determined that the functional currency for many of our subsidiaries outside the us has changed from the us dollar to local currency based on the criteria of sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position as of november  results of continuing operations results from operations declined for a second year to a  million loss in from a million loss in and million in earnings in this trend generally followed the continuing decline in orders to  million in from  million in and  million in in response to declining orders and revenue  beginning in  we took a number of steps to reduce our overall cost structure 
we began the plan in the fourth quarter of and continued it through the plan resulted in a workforce reduction of  including normal attrition  and a further reduction of  was announced in the plan 
primarily as a result of 
table of contents approximately million in restructuring savings from efforts in the plan  total costs and expenses declined in to  million from  million in after adjusting for the differences in inventory charges and the costs of restructuring  total costs and expenses declined approximately  million year over year in  despite an increase of million related to our enterprise resource planning erp and customer relationship management crm software initiatives in although we are cautiously optimistic about the recent growth in our quarterly revenue  with the fourth quarter of representing our best performance since the third quarter of  quarterly orders remained stagnant at around  million throughout we have therefore concluded that we must further reduce our cost structure in and have announced the plan  which began in the fourth quarter of the effort is designed to reduce our overall cost structure by an additional million per quarter beginning in the second half of we currently do not expect a major upturn in orders or revenue in the first six months of we intend to continue to reduce our costs and expenses and reach breakeven in our cash flows from operations in we also do not expect significant disruptions in our business from completing our erp and crm implementations in we did experience some slowdown and loss of orders during third quarter of related to our erp implementation  which we substantially recovered in our fourth quarter 
we believe that the risk of future material order and revenue losses is not significant 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over over change change in millions orders net revenue products services and other total net revenue years ended october  over over ppts change ppts change of total net revenue products services and other total years ended october  over over change change in millions net revenue by region us international total orders in declined compared to primarily due to continued weakness in telecommunications markets  which primarily affected our test and measurement business  but the decline was offset by orders growth in our semiconductor products and life sciences and chemical analysis businesses 
orders in compared to declined due to dramatic overall declines in the telecommunications  semiconductor and computer industries 
going into we will be relying primarily on new products to drive orders growth 

table of contents net revenue declined in as compared to primarily due to continued weakness in key market segments  particularly wireless and wireline telecommunications  as well as pricing pressures from both customers and competitors in the face of a weak economy 
declines outside the us were slightly lower than domestically in part due to our customers buying infrastructure products in asia 
continued slow markets in communications drove declines in product revenue  declines in service revenue were driven by reduced contract renewal rates as an increasingly large portion of our customers have elected to receive service on a time and materials basis 
services and other includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products  warranty extensions and consulting in all years  in addition to operating lease revenue in and excluding the cit group sale of million in and million in  net revenue for decreased percent compared to the decrease related primarily to the slowdown in the telecommunications  semiconductor and computer industries  which severely impacted our customers ability to purchase our products 
the decrease in domestic net revenue for came primarily from our businesses that serve the communications and electronics markets  the slowdown in those markets impacted our net revenue in the us somewhat more severely than other parts of the world 
the decrease in product revenue for was driven primarily by the slowdown in communications and electronics markets 
the decline in service revenue for was primarily the result of the cit group sale and the decline in service contract renewal rates 
generally  there is a lag between service revenue trends and product revenue trends  this lag occurs because service revenue is directly related to the size of our installed base of products not covered by warranty 
costs and expenses years ended october  over over as a of net revenue ppts change ppts change cost of products as a percentage of product revenue cost of services and other as a percentage of services and other revenue total costs as a percentage of total net revenue research and development selling  general and administrative cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in compared to  despite decreases in the actual dollar amounts of costs  due to the steep decline in revenue we experienced this year 
our fixed costs relating to continued overcapacity increase as a percentage of net revenue with any decline in net revenue 
savings in dollar terms were primarily the result of the plan  which yielded approximately million of savings in cost of products and services for the year  and reduced inventory charges 
excluding the cit group sale and restructuring charges of million in  cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue for increased percentage points compared to the increase was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
during  cost of products as a percentage of product revenue increased due to the same factors mentioned above and higher discounts offered to our customers 
discount increases affected the majority of our products and were the result of pressure from competitors and customers in the face of a declining economy 
inventory charges totaled million in compared to million in and million in the abnormally high charges in compared to and were the result of the rapid and steep market decline that year  which caused excess inventory of then current products and hastened the obsolescence of older products 
inventory charges in spanned the vast majority of our products as well as raw materials

research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in compared to as a direct result of decreased revenue  in compared to research and development expenses increased in both dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenue as a result of continuing expenditures toward new product introductions  many of which helped to offset our revenue losses in the current year 
our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future  foundation technologies research  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications research  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences research  which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes  and measurement research  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
our research improves on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices  digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies  systems and solutions such as applied mathematics  knowledge management and measurement science  life sciences such as computational biology  molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements  and photonics  such as precision automation technology  optical switching and high speed optical links 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term and other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
a significant portion of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  and other research is on major new product releases 
because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses  it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in compared to  despite reductions in overall spending  due to the significant decline in net revenue 
overall our spending on selling  general and administrative expenses in was million lower than in  despite an increase of approximately million in expense for our erp and crm systems as a result of savings from the plan

other income expense  net years ended october  over over change change in millions other income expense  net excluding the million impact of the sale of land in san jose  california in  other income expense  net increased million in compared to this net increase was due to million from reduced losses on equity investments  million from increased interest income from cash deposits and reduced interest expense due to the pay down of commercial paper and million from gains from dispositions 
these increases were partially offset by million due to interest payable on convertible debt issued in  million due to currency movement and million due to various items  none of which was individually material 
other income expense  net increased million in over the increase was primarily due to the sale of land in san jose  california  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million

however  despite the declines over the prior two years we feel well positioned going into  as we have made major strides toward stabilization since implementing our enterprise resource planning software platform and our products are well positioned to take advantage of the growth anticipated in china as that market continues to open in the near future 
generally speaking  the outlook for wireless communications test products is beginning to improve  while wireline products are anticipated to have a difficult year and we expect the market for general purpose test products to be mixed 
overall  we will rely on new products for orders growth in the coming year  both to take share in limited new market opportunities and to gain share in larger existing markets 
the decline in net revenue for compared to was primarily the result of the slowdown in the telecommunications industry  as was the decline in compared to the slowdown was particularly sharp in the second half of as we became increasingly dependent on incoming orders  which declined in virtually all of the product lines of our test and measurement businesses 
excluding the cit group sale  total net revenue for declined percent compared to pricing pressures from customers and competitors including sales of used equipment by customers either downsizing or going out of business also contributed to the decline in revenue in compared to overall discounts have increased by approximately percentage points since the beginning of  resulting in approximately million less revenue in compared to our percentage of revenue from new products increased approximately percentage points since early  in we introduced more than new products  nearly a quarter of which have significant strategic and financial impact on our business

however  the fact that losses increased only  million after removing the impact of reduced inventory charges  compared to reduced revenue of  is a sign that our restructuring efforts have had significant success in reducing our overall cost structure 
the plan saved approximately million in and we reduced average headcount by percent 
the plan will be focused on achieving breakeven or profitability for the business in  including an additional reduction in average headcount of percent and incremental savings of approximately million per quarter by the end of the year 
the savings will result from both the reduction in employee related costs and from shifting manufacturing and sales into lower cost regions 
loss from operations in was a result of reduced demand  which led to fewer sales and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory

life sciences and chemical analysis our life sciences and chemical analysis business provides application focused solutions that include instruments  software  consumables and services that enable customers to identify  quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products 
overall  orders growth over the last quarters has indicated that the markets for our life sciences and chemical analysis products has been slowly but steadily increasing  with some regular seasonality patterns that recur predictably each year 
due to us government and large pharmaceutical budgets  orders in our first and fourth quarters are seasonally greater than those in our second and third quarters 
however  general economic trends  new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year 
in  the primary driver for growth in life sciences products revenue was strong acceptance of new products  with some offsetting declines in the pharmaceuticals market

in our chemical analysis markets  us government spending on homeland security and asian government spending on infrastructure were the primary growth areas 
orders in asia grew percent this year  primarily for products in the environmental and foods markets 
the increase in orders in compared to was the result of the overall steady upward market trend in life sciences and chemical analysis products 
we expect that recently and soon to be released new products will continue to produce orders growth in the coming year 
the increase in net revenue for compared to was a result of increased sales in both our life sciences products and our chemical analysis products

new products contributed significantly to our performance in  revenue for new products was approximately to million for the year  primarily for microarrays and microarray systems  chemchip applications and systems and new liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry applications 
the increase in net revenue for compared to was the result of increased sales of our products in the life sciences market moderated by decreased sales of our products in our traditional chemical and petrochemical markets 
net revenue from products including liquid chromatography equipment  bioanalyzers and microarrays grew more than percent in compared to services and other revenue decreased slightly in compared to  primarily as a result of customers choosing to receive services on a time and materials basis rather than renewing long term service contracts  a common trend in the face of difficult economic times

inventory charges totaled million in compared to million in and million in the slightly increased inventory charge run rate in compared to both and was due to overall inventory reductions in the face of the difficult economy and some consolidation of warehouses to increase efficiency 
the life sciences and chemical analysis business did not participate significantly in the plan until the fourth quarter of  when we took steps to consolidate our facilities in california 
in order to minimize moving expense and capital investments in existing space  we will outsource components of the manufacturing process 
for the plan  our restructuring efforts will be focused on improving the manufacturability and quality of our products

inventory related charges were significantly lower in than in the previous year at million compared to million a year ago 
the abnormally high charges in compared to and were the result of the rapid and steep market decline that year  which caused excess inventory of then current products and hastened the obsolescence of older products 
as demand for our products generally declined in  we have been able to manufacture more products using inventory on hand and have reduced the amounts that we have purchased from suppliers 
an percent increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter in was the primary cause of a percent increase in accounts receivable at the end of as compared to the prior year 
at the end of fiscal accounts receivable had decreased by about percent compared to the end of fiscal  primarily due to a percent decline in fiscal fourth quarter revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of there were no material bad debt charges in any of the years presented 
the net amount of cash used in the reduction of accounts 
table of contents payable declined from million in to million in this trend is generally consistent with the decrease in our operating expenses 
in  million of cash was used to fund our us defined benefit plans and million was contributed to our international defined benefit plans 
this year s contributions were approximately million or percent larger than in the previous year due primarily to a decline in equity markets globally 
our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities  among other factors 
if the value of our assets declines relative to our future projected obligations  we have to make larger contributions to maintain our funded status 
in  we expect to fund our retirement plans in approximately the same amounts as in we currently have over billion of deferred tax assets 
the significant increase in deferred tax assets for is due primarily to net operating loss carry forwards nols  foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits 
we expect to utilize the nols  foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits to reduce future tax liabilities when we return to profitability 
our need to control discretionary spending and conserve cash in the face of the weak economy has significantly reduced the amounts we considered to be available for investments such as new company acquisitions  equity investments and property  plant and equipment 
net cash used by investing activities for was million compared to  million in and  million in in  we used million to purchase equity in strategically aligned companies 
in we spent million  primarily for the acquisition of osi and for the yokagawa purchase 
in we used million for the first and second installments of the yokagawa purchase along with investments in several other companies 
in  we used cash of million for a long term leasehold investment on which the lessee prepaid million of rent in capital spending controls imposed in the fourth quarter of reduced spending on property  plant and equipment by million in compared to the prior year

the total program costs for these three initiatives were million in compared to million in of these amounts  we capitalized million in and million in and the remainder was expensed 
we estimate that the total program cost in for these initiatives will be approximately million 
although these programs used significant resources in and  when they are completed we will be able to retire over legacy systems  resulting in significant savings 
we had no material dispositions of property  plant and equipment in compared to million in related to the sale of land in san jose and the cit group sale

we received billion in august of and since then we have received all of the million withheld by philips from the total purchase price at the time of the sale plus adjustments for the final purchased net assets 
cash flows from discontinued operations include the proceeds from the sale and cash used in the operations of the healthcare solutions business during the year up until the date of sale 
we have terminated our million five year revolving credit facility that was due to expire on november  and have not extended the million day revolving credit facility that terminated on november  we had no outstanding balances under these credit facilities during we did not have plans to use these credit facilities  and we believe that the costs of renewing and or retaining these credit facilities outweighed their benefits 
we continue to have access to uncommitted credit lines through our banking partners  although we do not anticipate any significant additional credit needs in the next year 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
these regular purchase agreements did not exceed percent of cost of sales 
we have contractual commitments to non cancelable operating leases and vendor financing arrangements with cit 
we provide lease guarantees on these financing arrangements and we have no other material guarantees or commitments 
see note  other accrued liabilities in item of this report for further information on lease guarantees 
see note  commitments in item of this report for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
we are taking actions to achieve positive cash flows from operations in we will benefit from significant cost savings through our restructuring programs and we have plans to further improve our collection of accounts receivable and lower our inventory levels 
inventory levels already have been reduced by over million from two years ago 
this represents major progress in a key area of our asset performance 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal operating cash flow patterns of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in a number of locations throughout the world  and in some cases tax rules and regulations could restrict our ability to move cash balances from one jurisdiction to meet cash requirements in another jurisdiction without incurring tax penalties 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and other borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs for risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products  such as the communications  electronics and semiconductor industries  remain depressed 
the economic downturn resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide 
in particular  the communications  semiconductor and electronics industries have been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the increasing erosion of average selling prices 
although some segments of these industries have shown recent signs of stabilization  others  especially in communications  continue to exhibit a downward cycle 
there has been year over year orders growth in our semiconductor products  life sciences and chemical analysis  semiconductor test and wireless test businesses  but demand in these markets remains volatile so the underlying trend is uncertain 
in addition  our 
table of contents businesses serving wireline telecommunications markets have continued to decline 
pricing pressures intensified throughout  reducing our gross margins 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last and when a sustained recovery in our markets may occur 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services 
in addition  if our customers markets continue to decline  we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us 
such further decline could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to reach our goals for restoring profitability 
also  in such an environment  pricing pressures could continue  and if we are unable to respond quickly enough this could negatively impact our gross margins 
finally  we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing at some time in the future  and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms when required 
the actions we took in response to the reduced demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business 
beginning in the third quarter of  our revenue started declining 
to scale back our operations and to reduce our expenses in response to this decreased demand for our products and services and lower revenue  we reduced our workforce  froze hiring  cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending 
we also initiated short term facility closures to reduce production levels 
in calendar year  we announced plans to reduce our workforce by approximately  people 
this reduction was completed at the end of the fourth quarter of in connection with our announcement of our results for the quarter ended july   we announced that to reach our profitability goals we will have to reduce costs by approximately another million per quarter 
this entails approximately  additional job cuts  which are underway 
in addition  from may to october of  we instituted a percent pay reduction applicable to all employees globally  wherever legally permissible 
starting in the first quarter of  we continued the percent pay reduction for approximately  of our senior managers 
in february of  we reinstated the pay reduction at a rate of percent for our other employees  wherever legally permissible 
the reductions in pay took effect via a reduction in hours for certain employees  in accordance with local law 
in addition to these measures  we are continuing our initiatives to streamline our operations 
the pay reductions continued throughout our third quarter 
starting august   we restored full pay to all employees worldwide  which increases the pressure to reach our profitability goals 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and sustain them at a level necessary to restore profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges 
for example  prior to the third quarter of  we had not anticipated the necessity for the further restructuring initiatives to reduce costs by another million per quarter 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
as demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity  our earnings may continue to suffer 
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet our expectations  our manufactur 
table of contents ing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements 
currently  we have excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications  electronics and semiconductor industries 
the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  our earnings 
conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business 
failure to adjust our orders for parts and inventories due to changing market conditions could adversely affect our earnings 
our earnings could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our orders for parts to market fluctuations 
in order to secure components for the production of products  we may continue to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors  or at times make advance payments to suppliers  which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications  semiconductor and electronics products has decreased 
for example  in the year ended october   we incurred approximately million of inventory related charges  and in the twelve months ended october   we have incurred approximately another million in inventory related charges 
if the demand for our products continues to decrease  we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
by contrast  during a market upturn  our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our inventories quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products 
approximately percent of our parts require custom work 
of these  some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers  due to their unique nature or the length of time necessary for design work 
should a supplier cease manufacture of such a component  we would be forced to reengineer our product 
in addition to discontinuing parts  suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
we are continuing to implement new information systems  and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems have interfered and could further interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our current systems  which are largely based on legacy systems that were created when we were a part of hewlett packard 
as a part of this effort  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage our business operations 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
in the quarter ended october   following the first phase of our enterprise resource planning software implementation  we were still experiencing some difficulties in providing customer quotes and in acknowledging and shipping customer orders 
although we believe that we have identified  to a large extent  the problems associated with the implementation and that the system is now stabilizing  new problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
during  we expect to implement a new customer support information system and some additional functionality to our enterprise resource planning software 
if further disruptions occur in the current implementation or the implementation of the additional system and functionality in  our operations could be interrupted 
such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
in addition  our future revenue and profit projections could be inaccurate if we have misjudged the realization of potential future savings from the new systems 

table of contents fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the senior convertible debentures 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
throughout  the continued low levels of orders significantly affected our ability to efficiently plan production and inventory levels  which led to fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
if we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall  this may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 
if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  price our products competitively  and anticipate our competitors development of new products  services or technological innovations 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the us accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  
table of contents differing labor regulations  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
the current us and international response to terrorism could exacerbate these risks 
for example  there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions such as southeast asia  where we have significant manufacturing operations 
this could disrupt our ability to manufacture products or import parts as well as cause interruptions and or delays in our ability to transport products to our customers or parts to other locations to continue the manufacturing and assembly processes 
any such delay or interruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
our decision to continue temporary pay cuts in and to eliminate pay increases for where legally permissible  along with the scaled down pay increase program for  may harm our long term ability to retain and hire key personnel 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past two years  and our attrition rate has remained low  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 
any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers 
table of contents also purchase other agilent products 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
if sales of custom integrated circuits to hewlett packard decline  our semiconductor products revenue will suffer  and we are limited in our ability to sell these integrated circuits to other companies 
historically  our semiconductor products business has sold custom products to hewlett packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of hewlett packard 
for the twelve months ended october   shipments from our semiconductor products group to hewlett packard accounted for approximately percent of our total shipments and approximately percent of our semiconductor products business shipments 
we have a license agreement with hewlett packard that covers integrated circuit technology used in custom integrated circuits for hewlett packard s printers  scanners and computers 
the license agreement provides that  until november in some cases and until november in other cases  we are prohibited  with some exceptions  from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products  printer products including printer supplies  accessories and components  document scanners and computing products to third parties other than hewlett packard 
although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to hewlett packard of custom integrated circuits used in printers  scanners and computers  the agreement does not require hewlett packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us 
in the event that hewlett packard reduces its purchases of our custom integrated circuits  we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers 
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlett packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hewlett packard 
hewlett packard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination  perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
in addition  hewlett packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation 
while hewlett packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties  remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties 
we cannot be sure that hewlett packard will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations 
we have agreed to indemnify hewlett packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hewlett packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hewlett packard 
while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties  subsurface contamination may exist  and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 

table of contents our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state and local laws governing the environment 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us  even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 
our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant international  federal  state and local regulations  including but not limited to health and safety  packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the us federal communications commission 
we also must comply with work safety rules 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our businesses could be harmed 
some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture  processing  distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act  and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act 
we must conform the manufacture  processing  distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  then we could be made to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and our failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
our sales to us government agencies and contractors are approximately percent of our total sales 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  or administrative penalties 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our 
table of contents technology  products or services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses 
we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses has changed as a result of our separation from hewlett packard 
in the past  as a part of hewlett packard  we benefited from our access to hewlett packard s entire intellectual property portfolio when asserting counterclaims and negotiating cross licenses with third parties 
our current patent cross license agreement with hewlett packard gives us only a limited right to sublicense a portion of hewlett packard s intellectual property portfolio 
accordingly  we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could have sublicensed hewlett packard s entire intellectual property portfolio 
nothing restricts hewlett packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to hewlett packard by us 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
furthermore  some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies  allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property 
if we suffer loss to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations 
our production facilities  headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california  and our production facilities in washington and japan  are all located in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 
although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 

table of contents if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
currently we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value 
for option grants that have an exercise price at or in excess of fair market value we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on net loss earnings and net loss earnings per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
note  stock based compensation  of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net loss income and loss earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three years 
if our operating results do not improve in the long term we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
a valuation allowance would be recorded if it were more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets would not be realized before they expire 
if we establish a valuation allowance we might record a tax expense in our statement of operations which would have an adverse impact on our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in each of fiscal years and were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
