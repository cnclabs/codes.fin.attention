item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in the united states  down from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from a year ago  due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments  as well as the continued weakness of the japanese yen  which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our japanese competitors

 securitization revenue includes the gains on sales of finance receivables  as well as the interest earned on retained securities  servicing fee income from sold receiveables that ford credit continues to service  and other income related to interest only strips 
interest only strips  also referred to as excess spread  represent ford credit s right to receive collections on sold receivables in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees 
gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold 
as shown above  in such gains were million  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the sale of receivables has the impact of reducing ford credit s financing margins in the year the receivables are sold as well as in future years 
the net impact of securitizations on ford credit s earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount  type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period  as well as the interest rate environments at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized

in  hertz had earnings of million 
the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the united states  reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and pricing of the slowdown in the united states economy

b includes capital contributions  dividends  loans  loan repayments and asset sales 
in  we spent billion for capital goods  such as machinery  equipment  tooling  and facilities  used in our automotive sector 
this was down billion from  reflecting primarily a reduced number of product introductions 
capital expenditures were of sales in  down percentage points from a year ago 
the billion improvement in working capital in reflected primarily lower receivables billion in compared with billion in  resulting largely from implementation of ford s best practices for receivables management mainly at volvo and land rover and inventory improvements across much of the company billion in compared with billion in 
dividends totaling million were paid from ford credit to ford in however  no dividend payments were made in the fourth quarter of additionally  in january  million of cash was contributed from ford to ford credit as additional equity  which lowered ford credit s debt to equity ratio to to calculated on a basis that treats proceeds from securitized funding as debt 
in  we spent billion for acquisitions of other companies primarily the final payment of billion to ab volvo for our acquisition of volvo car and contributed million to the financial services sector for the purchase of the minority interest in hertz 
these expenditures were offset partially by divestitures primarily proceeds of about million from the sale of assets to our getrag transmissions joint venture 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  we spent billion for purchases of our common stock under our billion share repurchase program billion and our anti dilutive share repurchase program 
issuances of common stock in  reflecting primarily employee stock option exercises  resulted in the receipt of proceeds of million 
debt and net cash at december   our automotive sector had total debt of billion  up billion from a year ago 
the weighted average maturity of this debt is approximately years  of which million matures by december  at december   our automotive sector had net cash defined as gross cash less total of long term debt and current portion of long term debt of billion  compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
credit facilities at december   the automotive sector had billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks  of this amount is available through june  ford also has the ability to transfer  on a non guaranteed basis  billion and million of these credit lines to ford credit and ford credit europe  respectively 
cumulative convertible trust preferred securities on january   we sold million shares of cumulative convertible trust preferred securities to the public at a price of per share  for net proceeds after underwriting commissions  but before expenses of  the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
the preferred securities were issued by ford motor company capital trust ii  the sole assets of which are the junior subordinated convertible debentures due january  of ford motor company 
the preferred securities can be converted into shares of ford common stock at any time at a conversion price of per share 
if converted  the aggregate amount of additional shares of ford common stock that would be outstanding would be about million shares 
financial services sector ford credit debt and cash ford credit s total debt was billion at december   equal to last year 
outstanding commercial paper at december  totaled billion at ford credit  with an average remaining maturity of days 
at december   ford credit had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
in the normal course of its funding activities  ford credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs 
this excess funding is referred to as overborrowings 
of the billion of cash and cash equivalents  billion represented these overborrowings 
funding ford credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business 
ford credit s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to i purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of ford products  which to a large extent are influenced by ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through ford credit  and ii repay its debt obligations 
funding sources for ford credit include the sale of commercial paper  issuance of term debt  the sale of receivables and  in the case of ford credit europe  the issuance of certificates of deposit to diverse investors in various markets 
ford credit s commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs 
ford credit has commercial paper programs in the united states  europe  canada and other international markets 
it reduced the amount of its outstanding global commercial paper from billion at the end of to billion billion net of overborrowings at december  by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables 
during  ford credit plans to maintain its commercial paper outstanding at levels of around billion to billion  net of overborrowings 
ford credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued denomination  floating rate demand notes through its ford money market account program 
at december   billion of such notes were outstanding 
bank borrowings by ford credit s foreign affiliates are an additional source of short term funding 
long term funding requirements for ford credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities underwritten in both the united states and international capital markets 
during  ford credit issued approximately billion of term debt with maturities of two to ten years 
during  ford credit plans to raise billion to billion through term debt issuances and billion to billion through securitization transactions excluding securitization transactions relating to asset backed commercial paper programs  which are discussed below 
other sources of funds include bank borrowings  mainly in countries where capital markets are less competitive 
beginning in  ford credit modified its funding strategy to reduce its reliance on short term funding 
ford credit increased its use of selling finance receivables in securitization transactions because of its lower relative cost as described below and issued a larger amount of unsecured long term debt to improve its liquidity 
ford credit will continue to use securitization as long as it provides added funding and remains cost efficient 
ford credit also developed additional funding sources and capacity to maintain a diversified funding portfolio  such as wholesale receivables securitization and asset backed commercial paper programs 
as a result of this funding strategy  the decline in debt ratings ford credit experienced in and did not have a material impact on its abilty to fund operations and maintain liquidity  although its access to the commercial paper market has declined 
in  ford credit s funding strategy will continue to focus on improving liquidity and making diverse and competitive funding sources available 
we believe that this funding strategy will allow ford credit to maintain liquidity through difficult economic conditions 
any further lowering of ford credit s debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets 
this in turn likely would cause ford credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions 
however  ford credit s ability to securitize its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  and ford credit s debt ratings 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding was no longer available to ford credit  its liquidity would be adversely impacted 
the cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin or spread over a benchmark interest rate  such as the london interbank offered rate or interest rates paid on us treasury notes of similar maturities 
spreads are typically measured in basis points  where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent 
the relative stability of spreads for funding through securitization transactions compared with unsecured term debt funding spreads and diversification of funding sources are the primary reasons ford credit securitizes assets as a funding source 
since  the fixed rate spread on ford credit s securitized funding has been at a level between and basis points above comparable us treasury rates  while ford credit s unsecured term debt funding spreads have fluctuated from as low as basis points to over basis points above comparable us treasury rates 
over the last year  ford credit significantly increased its use of securitization transactions because  as discussed above  they have become a more cost effective source of funds than unsecured financing sources 
for  and  ford credit s proceeds from the sale of finance receivables are shown below in billions receivable type retail wholesale net proceeds in addition  in january of ford credit sold receivables resulting in billion of proceeds 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for additional liquidity  ford credit maintains contractually committed credit facilities with banking institutions that totaled billion at december   including billion available for ford credit europe 
the majority of these facilities are available through june  and billion was in use at december  primarily by affiliates outside of the united states and europe 
in addition  ford credit and ford credit europe may at ford s option use billion and million  respectively  of ford s committed credit facilities  which also are available through june  at december   banks also provided billion of facilities to support ford credit s asset backed commercial paper program 
ford credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored  commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from ford credit  at ford credit s option  up to an aggregate of billion of receivables 
these agreements have varying maturity dates between june  and december  as of december   approximately billion of these commitments were utilized 
special purpose entities ford credit regularly uses securitization to finance its operations 
ford credit securitizes retail installment sales contracts with the most frequency 
ford credit also securitizes receivables from ford franchised dealers and non ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories  generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables 
ford credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases 
in a typical securitization  ford credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust spe and transfers the receivables to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the securities issued by the trust 
following the transfer of the sold receivables to the spe  the receivables are no longer assets of ford credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet 
the spe issues interest bearing securities  usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates  secured by future collections on the sold receivables and related collateral 
these securities  commonly referred to as asset backed securities  are structured into senior and subordinate classes 
the senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization  excess spread and cash reserve funds 
these securities generally are rated by at least two independent rating agencies and sold in registered public offerings or in private transactions exempt from registration under us securities laws 
ford credit uses spes in securitization transactions to achieve  for the benefit of securitization investors  isolation of the sold receivables so that the receivables securing the securities issued by the spe would be beyond the reach of ford credit s creditors 
the use of spes in this way allows the spe to issue highly rated securities in a highly liquid and efficient market  thereby providing ford credit with a cost effective source of funding 
the two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the spe is conventional in the asset backed securitization market 
most of these spes are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities 
none of our or ford credit s officers  directors or employees holds any equity interest in the spes or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the spes 
the spes do not own stock in either ford or ford credit or any of their affiliates 
ford credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the sold receivables 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  restricted cash held for the benefit of the spes and interest only strips 
subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the spes 
restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to spe investors  with unrestricted cash returned to ford credit after investors are fully paid 
interest only strips  also referred to as excess spread  represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the spe to pay interest and principal to investors and servicing fees 
the retained interests serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the spes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december  and  the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by ford credit that was held by spes was billion and billion  respectively 
at those dates  ford credit s retained interests in such sold receivables were billion and billion  respectively 
ford credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
the holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to ford credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require ford credit to repurchase their securities 
ford credit does not guarantee any securities issued by spes 
however  as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions  ford credit as the seller of the finance receivables to the spe  is obligated to provide certain kinds of support 
these support obligations fall into three basic categories indemnification 
ford credit is obligated to indemnify the spe for breaches of representations and warranties made at the time the receivables are originally transferred to the spe  and certain tax liabilities incurred by the trust or the holder of the securities issued by the spe 
receivable repurchase obligations 
the rating agencies specify eligibility criteria for receivables permitted to be included in securitizations 
ford credit makes representations and warrants to the spe that the sold receivables meet the eligibility criteria 
if a breach of any of our representations and warranties as to the eligibility of a sold receivable is later discovered  the spe may require us to repurchase the non conforming receivable from the spe 
the repurchase price is the face value of the receivable plus accrued interest 
mandatory sale of additional receivables 
ford credit uses both amortizing and revolving structures in its securitizations 
in most amortizing structures  the spe issues securities that will receive monthly payments of principal and interest and therefore amortize down as principal collections are received 
in revolving structures  the spe issues securities that only receive monthly interest payments for a set period of time  called the revolving period  before receiving repayments of principal 
because the principal amount of the issued securities remains constant during the revolving period while the principal balance of the underlying finance receivables are declining  ford credit  as the sponsor of the securitization transaction  is required to replenish or top up the spe with new receivables  which are paid for by the spe with proceeds from principal collections on the sold receivables during the revolving period 
in addition  in connection with securitization transactions  the spe engages ford credit to collect and service the sold receivables for a servicing fee of of the principal amount of the receivables 
as servicer of the sold receivables  ford credit is entitled to grant extensions and make adjustments to obligors if such extensions and adjustments are consistent with our servicing policies and procedures 
however  if ford credit makes material changes to a receivable  including changes to the interest rate  changes in the amount or number of monthly payments or extensions of the final payment date of any receivable beyond certain established dates  ford credit is required to repurchase the affected receivable from the spe at face value plus accrued interest 
hertz hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment 
hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers 
the financing requirements of hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry 
hertz s fleet size  and its related financing requirements  generally peak in the months of june and july  and decline during the months of december and january 
hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued hertz maintains domestic and foreign commercial paper programs to cover short term funding needs  and also draws from bank lines  as a normal business practice  to fund international needs 
hertz also is active in the medium term and long term debt markets 
during  hertz aligned its funding strategy with ford credit s by reducing its reliance on commercial paper and increasing its use of long term funding sources to improve its liquidity  and is planning on launching an asset backed securitization program during the second quarter of at december   hertz had committed credit facilities totaling billion 
of this amount  billion represents global and other committed credit facilities billion of which are available through june  and billion of which have various maturities of up to four years  million consists of seasonal short term facilities  and million consists of a revolving credit line provided by ford  which currently expires in june total company stockholders equity our stockholders equity was billion at december   down billion compared with december  this decrease reflected primarily net losses of billion  dividend payments of billion  foreign currency translation adjustments of billion primarily reflecting weakening currencies in europe  a net charge to equity on derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
of billion primarily foreign currency hedges and interest rate swaps and billion spent on share repurchases 
dividends and share repurchases in october  our board of directors declared a fourth quarter dividend on ford s common and class b stock of per share  which represented a reduction from the per share dividend that had been paid since the fourth quarter of on january   our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend on common and class b stock by declaring a first quarter dividend of per share  which represented a reduction from the fourth quarter dividend 
these dividend reductions will yield cash savings of nearly billion annually 
also  during we purchased billion of our common stock under our billion share repurchase program that had commenced in september however  in may  we suspended share repurchases indefinitely 
debt ratings our short and long term debt are rated by three major rating agencies fitch  inc fitch  moody s investors service  inc 
moody s  and standard poor s rating services  a division of mcgraw hill companies  inc s p 
in addition to these three rating agencies  we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies 
debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  and are based on information provided by us or other sources that rating agencies consider reliable 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
long and short term debt ratings of bbb and f or higher by fitch  baa and p or higher by moody s and bbb and a or higher by s p are considered investment grade 
however  debt ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company  and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
fitch ratings 
on september   fitch lowered the long term debt ratings of ford  ford credit and hertz from a to a and lowered ford credit s and hertz short term debt ratings from f to f with a negative outlook for all entities

we adopted this statement on january  although we are item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assessing the impact  we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following product warranties estimated warranty costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer 
estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical warranty claim experience 
included in our warranty cost accruals are costs for basic warranties on vehicles we sell  extended service plans ie  where customers pay a fee to have extended warranty coverage beyond the base warranty period  product recalls and customer satisfaction actions outside the base warranty 
an example of a customer satisfaction action would be our firestone tire replacement action begun in may  in which we offered to replace million firestone tires installed on our vehicles 
warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from that estimated 
marketing incentives costs for customer and dealer cash incentives and costs for special financing and leasing programs that we sponsor through ford credit eg  financing program are recognized as sales reductions at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated 
in general  the amount of financing cost that we provide to ford credit is the difference between the amounts offered to retail customers and a market based interest or lease rate 
costs for marketing incentives are based upon assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive applied against them 
to the extent the actual number of vehicles differs from this estimate  or if a different mix of incentives occurs  the marketing expense accruals are adjusted 
retirement benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit ie  health care and life insurance costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trends rates  inflation  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a regional operating business unit basis using undiscounted after tax estimated cash flows or on an individual asset basis if the asset is held for sale 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding impairment charges incurred in respect of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our north and south american automotive operations in and our european automotive operations in allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of losses inherent in ford credit s portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases 
these losses result from obligors or lessees failing to timely make principal  interest or lease payments 
our estimates are based on several factors  including prices of used vehicles  loan to value ratios  the number of payments remaining to be made on the obligation all of which affect severity of loss and economic conditions and the credit risk quality of the portfolio both of which affect the frequency of defaults 
we monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly 
when we determine an account to be uncollectible  we reduce our finance receivables and lease investments and write off the loss through our allowance for credit losses 
we increase our allowance for credit losses by amounts we recover on finance receivables and lease investments we previously charged off as an uncollectible account

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ford credit market and other risks credit risk 
depreciation expense on operating leases and residual values we have a significant number of vehicles in ford credit s operating lease portfolio 
our operating lease customers pay us fixed monthly rental payments that we cannot subsequently alter 
at lease termination  our operating lease customers have the opportunity of either purchasing the vehicle for the lease end value specified in their lease contract or returning the vehicle to us 
we sell at auction substantially all vehicles returned to us 
we estimate the lease end value based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information  such as our new product plans  marketing programs and quality metrics 
we record depreciation expense for vehicles subject to operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in amounts necessary to reduce the vehicle to its estimated residual value at the end of the lease term 
accumulated depreciation is reflected on our balance sheet and is included in our net investment in operating leases 
initially  depreciation expense is based on our assessment of lease end residual value at the time of contract origination 
monthly  we monitor vehicle line performance and  quarterly  we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation reserve 
the most significant factors we examine to assess whether adjustments are required are lease termination volumes  vehicle return rates and expected used car values at the end of the lease terms 
if we determine that modifications are necessary  we will record adjustments to accumulated depreciation through earnings over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio 
outlook industry sales volumes and financial results our outlook for car and truck including heavy trucks industry sales in in our major markets is as follows united states approximately million units  compared with the million units sold in europe approximately million units  compared with the million units sold in both figures based on nineteen markets brazil approximately million units  compared with the million units sold in australia approximately  units  compared with the  units sold in based on these and other assumptions eg  assumptions regarding marketing costs  which are expected to be higher in  we expect earnings excluding unusual items to be about breakeven  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with the automotive sector incurring significant losses and the financial services sector providing offsetting profits 
in addition  we expect the operating related changes in gross cash for the automotive sector calculated on the basis described under liquidity and capital resources automotive sector gross cash to be negative in similar to the improvements in cost and the other expected benefits of the revitalization plan  we expect to achieve meaningful improvements in such operating cash flow by mid decade

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and other risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  as well as risks to availability of funding sources  hazard events  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which includes regular reports to a central management committee that oversees global risk management practices 
our risk management program recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce profit volatility 
for more information on these financial exposures  see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our automotive and financial services sectors also are exposed to liquidity risk  or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable 
we  and particularly ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through any economic or business cycle 
as discussed in greater detail in item  our funding sources include commercial paper  term debt  sale of receivables through securitization transactions  committed lines of credit from major banks  and other sources 
we also are exposed to a variety of insurable risks  such as loss or damage to property  liability claims  and employee injury 
we protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses 
the market and counterparty risks of our automotive sector and ford credit are discussed and quantified below 
automotive market and counterparty risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in affiliates 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce income volatility and is based on clearly defined guidelines 
speculative actions are not permitted 
in our hedging actions  we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange  interest rate and other price risks eg  forward contracts  options and interest rate swaps 
we use a value at risk var analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary assumptions used in the var analysis are as follows o a monte carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments eg  forwards and options and all significant underlying exposures 
the var analysis includes an month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued o the var analysis calculates the potential risk  within a confidence level  on cross border currency cash flow exposures  including the effects of foreign currency derivatives 
translation exposures are not included in the var analysis 
the monte carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios  which have a statistically lognormal distribution 
o estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the riskmetricstm datasets 
hedging actions substantially reduce our risk to changes in currency rates 
based on our overall currency exposure including derivative positions during  the risk during to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average million  with a high of million and a low of million 
at december   currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next months by less than million  within a confidence level 
compared with our projection at december   the var amount is approximately million lower  primarily because of decreased currency exchange rate volatility 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as non ferrous eg  aluminum and precious metals eg  palladium  platinum and rhodium  ferrous alloys eg  steel  energy eg  natural gas and plastics eg  polypropylene  which we use in the production of motor vehicles 
we use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge 
the fair value liability of such contracts  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was approximately a negative million and a positive million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change we would experience in purchasing the underlying commodities 
in addition to these price hedging activities  our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business 
these procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts  long term supply contracts and stockpiles 
the billion pre tax write down of precious metals  discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  related to these procurement activities 
in conjunction with this write down  we modified our processes so that any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is executed by or coordinated with our treasurer s office  which manages our price hedging activity 
our price hedging policy is based on clearly defined guidelines 
speculative actions are not permitted 
in  we enhanced our risk evaluation to include a var analysis  using historical volatilities  to evaluate our exposure to changes in commodity prices given our financial hedges  forward procurement and supply contracts on those commodities which we hedge 
based on our commodity exposure and related hedging activity  at december   commodity price movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next twelve months by up to million  within a confidence level 
over the last year the var measurements averaged million  with a high of million and a low of million 
these risk levels are substantially lower than they would otherwise be without hedging actions 
counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract 
exposures managed are financial and primarily relate to investments in fixed income products and derivative transactions for the purpose of managing interest rate  currency and commodity risk 
we  together with ford credit  establish exposure limits for each counterparty to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
exposures are monitored on a regular basis 
our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive  allowing us to take risk mitigation actions 
exposure limits are established for both mark to market and future potential exposure  based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities 
a monte carlo simulation technique is utilized to generate the potential exposure by tenor  within a confidence level market convention 
estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn from riskmetricstm datasets 
ford credit market and other risks overview ford credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities 
in addition to counterparty risk discussed above  ford credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures o credit risk the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms 
o residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by ford credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values 
o market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will make ford credit s positions less valuable 
o liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner 
o operating risk the possibility of errors relating to transaction processing and systems  actions that could result in compliance deficiencies with regulatory standards or fraud by ford credit s own employees or outside persons 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk 
business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks 
see ford motor credit company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  for more information on this subject 
credit risk ford credit extends consumer credit by purchasing retail vehicle installment sale and lease contracts from vehicle dealers 
these contracts are divided into segments by credit risk tier  term and whether the vehicle financed or leased is new or used 
segment data are used to ensure that pricing and servicing procedures are commensurate with the risk associated with each contract 
ford credit has behavioral models to assist in determining the best collection strategies 
in general  collection procedures are designed to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts 
as a final step  after reasonable collection efforts have failed  vehicles are repossessed  however  collection efforts of any remaining balance continue until the account is paid in full or determined to be uncollectible 
ford credit also extends non consumer loans  which include wholesale and other loans to dealers as well as automotive financing for commercial entities 
to monitor credit performance  ford credit requires dealers to submit monthly financial statements  performs periodic physical audits of vehicles with more frequent audits for higher risk dealers  and monitors inventory payoffs daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns  in which case appropriate actions are taken 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued residual risk ford credit s lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values that approximate residual values published in automotive leasing guide 
for financial reporting purposes  however  ford credit sets the internal value of expected residual values net of costs based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information such as new product plans  marketing programs and quality metrics 
any unfavorable difference between the customer contract lease end value and ford credit s internal forecast is accrued and expensed as depreciation 
ford credit reviews the depreciation rates on leased vehicles quarterly and adjusts them as needed to reflect changes in the projected residual values 
at lease termination  ford credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value  net of transportation cost 
sometimes  lease extensions or early terminations are offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns 
market risk the goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
ford credit uses various financial instruments  particularly interest rate and currency swaps to manage market risk 
ford credit is exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives  and  does not engage in any trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivative markets 
since ford credit s principal use of derivatives is to eliminate mismatches between the terms of assets and liabilities  changes in interest rates and exchange rates would have generally offsetting effects on the value of ford credit s financial assets and derivative instruments and  therefore  would not be expected to have a material impact on ford credit s financial position or results of operations 
for instance  assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets  debt and hedging instruments  ford credit s after tax earnings would decline by million over the ensuing twelve month period 
liquidity risk one of ford credit s major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle 
ford credit focuses on developing funding sources to support growth and refinancing of maturing debt 
ford credit also issues debt that  on average  matures later than assets liquidate  further enhancing overall liquidity 
global funding activities include the direct and dealer placed commercial paper  the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and public and private sale of receivables 
ford credit s ability to raise funds at a competitive cost is linked to its debt ratings 
management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt  the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt 
stress testing of ford credit s liquidity position is conducted periodically 
for a detailed discussion of ford credit s funding sources and debt ratings  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued operating risk ford credit operates in many locations and relies on the abilities of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in financial loss  regulatory action and damage to our reputation 
to address this risk  we and ford credit maintain internal control processes that identify transaction authorization requirements  safeguard assets from misuse or theft  and ensure the reliability of financial and other data 
we also maintain system controls to maintain the accuracy of information about our operations 
these controls are designed to manage operating risk throughout our operations
