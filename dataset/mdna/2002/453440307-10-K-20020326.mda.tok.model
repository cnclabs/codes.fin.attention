critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policy relates to liabilities for future insurance policy benefits which are computed primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality morbidity on health insurance and withdrawals 
liabilities for future insurance policy benefits on certain short term medical coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data

liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is used partially to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations which are calculated using certain assumed interest rates 
asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  resale agreements  policy loans and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed income securities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
less than 
of the company s total inves tments were in real estate and mortgage loans 
less than of the company s total investments were in non performing fixed maturities 
risk management the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities  and may utilize options to modify the duration and average life of such assets  see note f iv of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change in change in interest rates fair value fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insu rance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies come from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional gains in its portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
balance sheet the increase in total investments is offset by the decrease in cash and the increase in due to brokers because of the timing of securities trades 
the decrease in due from reinsurers is due to the settlement of a personal accident reinsurance agreement 
the increase in total stockholders equity is due to net income generated in the year ended december  partially offset by the net repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends and interest income from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity 
regulatory constraints historically have not affected the company s consolidated liquidity  although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the insurance group 
total corporate liquidity cash  cash equivalents  resale agreements  fixed maturities  equity securities and partnership interests amounted to million at december  on september  ihc completed a modified dutch auction tender offer by repurchasing  shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share 
during  including those shares from the modified dutch auction  ihc repurchased  shares of common stock for million under a repurchase program initiated in in the second quarter of  ihc received million upon exercise of  warrants for  shares of common stock 
all unexercised warrants have now expired in accordance with their terms 
capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
the company has expected capital expenditures relating to debt repayments and non cancelable leases of the following at december   and  thereafter 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair market value or as available for sale carried at fair market value  the company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available for sale 
the company experienced a change in unrealized losses of million  net of deferred taxes of 
million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs of million in total stockholders equity  reflecting net unrealized gains of 
million at december  versus million at december  from time to time  as warranted  the company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
the results of reflect a slightly higher effective tax rate than in due to an increase in state taxes in as previously reported  the company expects that its future results will continue to reflect slightly higher effective tax rates 
outlook managing general underwriters in  independencecare acquired all of the assets of two managed care managing general underwriters mgu based in nashville and chicago writing provider excess loss and hmo reinsurance 
the chicago operations were subsequently consolidated into the minneapolis office 
in  independencecare acquired the assets of an employer medical stop loss mgu in austin  tx and opened a marketing office in california 
these investments  together with the company s investments in four other mgus  should enable the company to control a substantial portion of the distribution network for its core health care products  and provide an outlet for its other group benefits products  including group life  statutory short term disability  long term disability  vision and dental marketed to employers through brokers  producers and hmos 
business the company anticipates increasing its premium volume through i investments in affiliated marketing subsidiaries  ii expansion of its network of mgus  mgas  hmos  general agents and agents  iii acquisitions of blocks of business  iv greater geographical diversity  v strategic marketing alliances  and vi new product lines for madison life and first standard 
the company is particularly interested in acquiring the following types of policies traditional and group life  interest sensitive life  credit life and health  limited benefit health eg  cancer or hospital indemnity  medical stop loss  dbl blocks  and certain other disability
