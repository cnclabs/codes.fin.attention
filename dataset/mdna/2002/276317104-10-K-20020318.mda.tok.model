item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income for totaled million  or per basic share  on sales of million 
these results represent a decrease in net income from and a decrease in sales 
net income for totaled million  or per basic share  on sales of million 
with greenwald sales excluded  earnings and sales for would have decreased and  respectively 
the reason earnings declined more sharply than sales was that the company incurred additional overhead through its building expansion programs and acquisition initiatives in and the company had expected these higher overhead costs to be absorbed by the significantly greater sales volume it anticipated for  but such volume failed to materialize as the manufacturing sector of the us economy fell into a recession 
the company ended with a backlog level below that at year end  but still totaling million 
net income for the fourth quarter totaled million  or 
per basic share  on sales of million 
these figures represent a decline in net income and an decline in sales from net income for the fourth quarter totaled million  or 
per basic share  on sales of million 
the decrease in sales and earnings was the result of the significant slowdown in the manufacturing sector of the economy 
the negative impact on earnings  however  was partly offset by two positive developments lower than anticipated utility and compensation expenses  and the receipt of about  shares of common stock from prudential financial inc following prudential s conversion from a mutual insurance company to a stockholder owned company 
the lower expenses contributed approximately  or 
per basic share  to net income  while the prudential stock contributed about  or 
per basic share 
without these favorable items  fourth quarter net income would have been approximately  or 
per basic share  a decrease of from the fourth quarter of the gross margin for the fourth quarter of was of net sales as compared to for the fourth quarter of product mix in the fourth quarter accounted for the reduction in the gross margin percentage 
selling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter totaled million  a decrease from the level 
this decrease was due to lower legal and professional expenses  lower compensation and personnel related expenses 
results of operations the following table shows  for  each line item from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling and administrative expense other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for decreased million to million from million for volume reduced sales by  while new product introductions raised sales by and price increases raised them by 
the industrial hardware segment experienced an decline in sales 
volume decreased sales by  while internally developed new products for the utility truck and vehicular accessory markets increased sales by and price increases raised them 
sales of heavy hardware to the tractor trailer market decreased from levels 
sales to this market began to decline in the latter half of  when truck and trailer manufacturers with excessive inventories started to reduce their purchases 
this market is expected to show a moderate improvement in the second half of as manufacturers begin to replenish their inventories 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufactures and distributors were off from this was primarily due to the downturn in the manufacturing sector of the economy 
sales of school bus door closures decreased  and sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches declined 
sales at the company s mexican operations decreased from despite the slowdown in the economy  the company continued to invest in new products  including a recently developed electronic bus door control device 
this device is currently undergoing field testing by several school bus manufacturers 
once testing is completed and the product is approved  the company expects to begin receiving orders in the second half of in the security products segment  sales were higher than in price increases raised sales by  and volume increases raised them 
the volume increases were primarily due to the acquisition of the greenwald businesses  which were added to the security products segment in the third quarter of with greenwald sales excluded from the security segment  sales would have been down in sales of locks to the computer industry decreased in the decrease resulted partly from the downturn in the computer industry  and partly from a recent decision by one of our major customers to offer locking mechanisms as an option on new business servers and computers 
sales of high security locks for coin operated vending  gaming and amusement equipment were off in this decline was the direct result of a slowdown in the expansion of casinos and game rooms  and a slowing of commercial development requiring new coin operated vending equipment 
sales of locks to distributors servicing lower volume accounts decreased in also down were sales of locks for access door  furniture  electronics and vehicular applications 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry declined  fourth quarter sales to this market were especially hard hit 
however  there have been some signs in that the luggage lock business is picking up 
sales to locksmiths were off in sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry were also affected by the slowdown in the economy 
sales to original equipment manufacturers such as whirlpool  ge  maytag and alliance were off by for the year 
sales to distributors in the commercial laundry industry were comparable to prior year levels  while sales to the route operators in that industry were off 
sales of smart card products  however  grew by from the prior year due to greater acceptance of smart card technology and an increase in our customer base 
despite the decline in business during  the company continued to invest in research and development in order to introduce new products and technology in the mechanical and smart card product lines 
during  the company introduced a high security push button lock for medical cabinetry applications  and also introduced a new drawer slide product line 
these new products have been met with a positive response from our local sales representatives  current customers and trade show attendees  and should have a positive effect on the markets we serve 
although sales of our security products have gotten off to a slow start for the first two months of  the company is optimistic that business will pick up as the economy begins to recover from the recession 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
volume reduced sales  while price increases raised them 
sales of contract castings were down from this decrease was mainly due to the loss in of orders we had received from another foundry in when that foundry was temporarily shut down by a fire 
without this temporary contract casting business included in  sales would have been down in the contract casting business continues to be adversely affected by the importation of castings from china  germany and mexico 
because of lower labor costs in these countries and favorable currency exchange rates  the imports are creating pricing pressures in the casting markets 
sales of mine roof support anchors increased from the energy crisis in california and the surge in natural gas prices in and early led to a heightened demand for coal  which in turn led to the reopening of several underground coal mines that used the company s proprietary mine roof anchor support systems 
coal remains the cornerstone of the us energy supply 
approximately billion tons of coal are mined from  mines in the united states each year  and about of that volume is consumed by power companies 
although the demand for coal is influenced by the weather and the price of natural gas and oil  coal is still the least costly and most price stable energy source available today 
at the same time  mining technology has evolved over the years  with fewer underground mines in operation  there is now less call for mine roof support systems than there was in the past 
to remain competitive as mining techniques have changed  the company has been looking at new manufacturing methods and at alternative products 
the company has invested in the equipment and developed the technical knowledge necessary to begin the production of ductile iron 
ductile iron is superior to malleable iron  and is lower in cost to produce 
we expect that the market for ductile iron will grow as this metal is substituted for malleable iron 
also  the company is developing new mine roof anchor systems to more effectively compete with resin bolt systems 
total gross margin for decreased  or million  from the decrease resulted from the combination of lower sales and under absorbed overhead 
the gross margin percentage for was approximately percentage points below the level versus 
total selling and administrative expenses were up  or  from most of the increase was due to the inclusion of greenwald for the full months of other items that increased included goodwill amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions made in  payroll expenses and advertising expenses 
interest expense increased  or  from this was due to the additional borrowings principally for the greenwald acquisition in that were on the books for the months of earnings before income taxes in decreased  or million  from pretax earnings for the industrial hardware segment sank by  or million 
this decrease was due to lower sales volume and under utilized production facilities 
the security products segment experienced a decrease of  or  in pretax earnings 
this decrease was partially offset by results from the greenwald acquisition  with greenwald excluded  the negative impact would have been greater 
in the metal products segment  pretax earnings were down  or  due to a reduction in contract casting business 
corporate expenses were down  or  as the result of lower compensation expenses and the income received from the prudential demutualization 
the effective tax rate in was  up from in the higher rate for was due to higher foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividend distribution 
fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales for increased million to million from million for new product introductions raised sales by  price increases  by  and volume increases  by 
the industrial hardware segment experienced a increase in sales from volume increased sales by  while internally developed new products increased sales 
products acquired during increased sales by another 
internally developed products were items for the electronics cabinetry and truck accessory markets 
acquired products consisted of door closure hardware for school buses and new toolbox locks for the truck accessory market 
sales of heavy hardware to the tractor trailer market decreased from levels 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers and distributors more than offset the decline in the tractor trailer market 
due to demand for the industrial hardware products in and expected growth in the school bus market  the company expanded its cleveland manufacturing facility by  square feet 
at the company s mexican operation  sales grew as demand increased for high quality industrial and vehicular products 
in june of  the company acquired greenwald industries and incorporated it into the security products segment formerly the custom locks segment 
greenwald manufactures coin acceptors and other coin security products used primarily in the commercial laundry industry 
greenwald also produces cashless payment systems that use advanced smart card technology 
in the security products segment  sales increased from volume increased sales by and prices increased them by 
the volume increase was attributable to the addition of greenwald sales for the last half of in other areas of the security products segment  sales of locks were down slightly from lock sales to the computer industry were down primarily because of delays in the introduction of new business computers and servers 
sales to the gaming machine market were also off from levels due to minimal new casino construction and few expansions of existing casinos 
a increase in sales from our asian operations helped offset the declines in sales to the computer and gaming industries 
sales of prestolock r padlocks for soft sided luggage increased from levels 
sales of sesamee r keyless padlocks increased 
although sales of sesamees were generally up across all markets served  the advance was greatest in the telecommunications market  where sales were fueled by increased construction of cell phone towers 
sesamee padlocks are used to secure gates and sheds around the towers 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
volume brought sales down  while price increases raised sales and new products increased them 
the sales of new products were the result of orders received from a foundry that had temporarily shut down due to a fire but subsequently reopened 
without the infusion of new business from this foundry  our contract casting business would have been down from the previous year 
the segment was affected by an overall decline in domestic production of malleable iron castings and a parallel increase in the importation of foreign castings 
castings imported from countries in asia  latin america and europe with weak currency exchange rates created pricing pressure and eroded our contract casting business 
this business was further weakened by declines in the market for residential gas fittings and residential and commercial electrical fittings  and by the phaseout of certain automotive products 
metal products was also affected by a drop in sales of mine roof support products 
although coal remains one of the country s largest energy resources  the sales decrease was due to a continued reduction in the prevalence of underground mining 
total gross margin for increased  or million  from the increase resulted from higher sales 
the gross margin percentage for was comparable to s versus since the company was able to integrate the greenwald acquisition with little disruption of current operations and without incurring any additional charges which would have affected margins 
total selling and administrative expenses were up  or million  from most of the increase was due to the inclusion of greenwald 
other items that increased included goodwill amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions made in  payroll expenses and advertising expenses 
interest expense jumped  or million  from this was due to additional borrowings  principally for the acquisition of greenwald in earnings before income taxes in increased  or  from pretax earnings for the industrial hardware segment rose by  or million 
this increase was due to greater sales volume  full use of production facilities and sales of new products with higher profit margins 
the security products segment experienced a gain of  or  in pretax earnings 
this increase resulted from the greenwald acquisition  otherwise  pretax income would have been negatively affected by lower earnings from existing lock operations 
in the metal products segment  earnings were down  or  due to a reduction in mine roof anchor sales and increased foreign competition in the contract casting market 
corporate expenses were down  or  as the result of lower compensation expenses and lower group insurance costs 
the effective tax rate in was  the same as in liquidity and sources of capital current ratio average days sales in accounts receivable inventory turnover ratio of working capital to sales total debt to market capitalization total debt to equity in  the company entered into an unsecured loan agreement the loan agreement with a financial institution 
the proceeds under the loan agreement were used to finance the greenwald acquisition and to increase our line of credit for future working capital needs 
under the term portion of the loan agreement  the company borrowed million  which is payable in quarterly principal payments of  during the first year 
the quarterly principal payments increase annually up to million 
a final principal payment of million is due at maturity  on july  the loan agreement requires the company to maintain an interest rate swap contract with the lender for million 
this sum is to be reduced each quarter in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the swap contract is fixed at 
under the revolving credit portion of the loan agreement  the company may borrow up to million until july  a quarterly commitment fee of is to be paid on the unused portion 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the loan agreement  the company does not expect to make any repayments before july  the interest rates on the term and the revolving credit portions of the loan agreement may vary 
for the term portion  the interest rate is based on libor plus additional interest of to 
for the revolving credit portion  the rate is based on libor plus to 
the additional interest percentages are based on operating results calculated on a rolling four quarter basis 
in  the company borrowed million to finance specific building improvements and equipment acquisitions 
the borrowing was structured in the form of a lease classified as a capital lease obligation 
the lease obligation is collateralized by a security interest in the aforementioned equipment and a  letter of credit 
the ratio of working capital to sales was in  in and in the higher ratio in was due to planned increases in inventory levels and an investment in common stock received as compensation from prudential financial in connection with prudential s demutualization in the fourth quarter of the higher ratio in was due to a higher cash balance to finance the purchase of two small product lines school bus door closure hardware and toolbox locks in these acquisitions were not material to the company s financial position or operating results 
accounts receivable decreased  or million  from the level 
this decrease was the direct result of lower sales volume 
the average days sales in accounts receivable equaled in compared with days in and days in the increase in collection days from to was due to a higher number of foreign trade accounts  which often pay more slowly than do domestic trade accounts 
the company continues to monitor and press for current collections of accounts receivable 
inventories increased in by  or million  from the increase was due to the stocking of additional inventory for ccl s move from new britain  ct  to wheeling  il  and for a planned three week shutdown at frazer jones in january for machine maintenance and test pouring of ductile iron 
inventory turnover remained substantially unchanged at times in versus times in and times in inventories are slightly higher than required  and the company continues working to reduce levels in order to free up working capital 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company continuously upgrades and replaces existing equipment to expand capacity  improve efficiency and satisfy safety and environmental requirements 
the company expects that capital expenditures for will be lower than projected depreciation expense of million 
the present financial strength of the company s balance sheet demonstrated by a current ratio of to  positive cash flow from operating activities and availability of a million credit line will enable the company to meet its current obligations and continue to grow in impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant  as the company has generally been able to adjust its prices to reflect higher manufacturing costs  or has been able to improve its manufacturing processes to achieve increased productivity 
historical data as presented in the financial statements reasonably relate current costs  except for depreciation  to revenues generated in the period 
depreciation expense based on the current replacement cost of plant and equipment would be higher than depreciation expense reported in historical financial statements 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for its domestic inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current cost and thus provides a closer matching of revenue and expenses in periods of increasing costs 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s foreign manufacturing facilities account for approximately of total sales and of total assets 
its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales less than of total sales to non affiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to foreign markets  any currency exchange gains or losses are not material 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its unsecured million loan agreement  which provides for interest based on libor plus a spread of up to 
the spread is determined by a comparison of the company s operating performance with agreed upon financial targets 
since the company s performance depends to a large extent on the overall economy  the interest rate paid by the company under its loan agreement is closely linked to the trend in the us economy 
the current interest rate spread is on the term loan portion and on the revolving credit line portion of the loan agreement 
changes in libor rates will also affect the company s interest expense 
to hedge against future libor rate increases  the company has a swap contract on part of the term loan portion of the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the contract is 
the notional amount of the swap contract is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the notional amount of the swap contract was million as of december  the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause a  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
