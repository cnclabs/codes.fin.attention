item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
basis of presentation we account for our interest in first permian using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we record our investment in first permian at cost on the balance sheet 
this is increased or reduced by our proportionate share of first permian s income or loss  which is presented as one amount in the statements of income loss 
our share of first permian s oil and gas reserves is presented separately under our oil and gas reserve information in note to the financial statements 
at december   we recorded a loss of  in our investment in first permian 
our loss was recorded as a net liability in our investment to the extent that we had guaranteed  of first permian s bank debt 
effective october   we were released from this guarantee and  discontinued the equity method of accounting for our share of losses in first permian 
in  we resumed the equity method of accounting as our portion of first permian s net income exceeded the losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
in  we recorded equity in income of  general our long term business strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings by 
using advanced technologies to conduct exploratory activities  
acquiring properties that we believe add incremental value  
investing in high potential exploration prospects  
exploiting our existing producing properties  
emphasizing cost controls  and 
positioning for opportunity 
since  our primary focus has been exploratory drilling using d seismic technology 
our long term business strategy is to increase our reserve base by using this and other advanced technologies 
additionally  we intend to exploit our existing properties and acquire other properties we believe can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
we undertake projects only when we believe the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
we also endeavor to maximize the present value of our projects by accelerating production of our reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management and prevailing energy prices 
following this strategy  we have discovered oil and gas reserves using d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio wilcox gas trend onshore the gulf coast of south texas 
additionally  we have acquired producing oil and gas properties in the permian basin of west texas 
capital used to acquire these properties has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of our equity securities and cash flows from operations 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by 
seasonal demand  
weather  
hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  
availability of pipeline transportation to end users  
proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and 
to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include 
production expenses  
overhead requirements  and 
costs of capital 
our oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included 
cash flow from operations  
sales of our equity securities  and 
bank borrowings 
depletion per ebo was versus in and in the increase per ebo in was a result of an increase of approximately million in the net oil and gas properties depletable base 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our 
reserve base  
sources of production  
product mix gas versus oil volumes  and 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production 
year to year or other periodic comparisons of the results of our operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe our condition

critical accounting policies and practices full cost 
parallel accounts for its oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of nonproducing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
provision for depletion of oil and gas properties  under the full cost method  is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
our discounted present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost property writedown 
in addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that we use prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
impairment of assets 
under the full cost accounting rules  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit  which is based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in deferred tax asset 
the deferred tax asset represents future tax deductions  tax credits and carryforwards that are expected to be realized by reducing future income tax expense 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our estimate of future taxable income is impacted by the historical volatility in crude oil and gas prices  the uncertainty of future commodity prices  and our history of generating net losses 
in  management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize all the available carryforwards prior to their ultimate expiration 
in  the valuation allowance was reversed as we expect to be able to utilize carryforwards prior to their expiration due to the impending sale of our investment in first permian 
if the sale of first permian s assets does not occur  our assessment of the deferred tax asset will change and a valuation allowance may be necessary 
years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
parallel s total oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of  or approximately  from  for the increase in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in the average prices we received for our oil and natural gas production volumes  and to a increase in production volumes 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  ebo compared with  ebo in  a increase  resulting from a increase in natural gas production 
the increase in natural gas production was primarily due to increased drilling activity in production costs 
the increase in production costs for  compared with  was primarily the result of adding higher cost oil and gas production  an increase in ad valorem taxes and  to a lesser degree  an increase in production volumes 
production costs increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of production costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily because of slightly lower oil and gas prices 
average production costs per ebo increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to salary and benefit adjustments and increased franchise taxes 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in this increase is primarily a result of the low oil and gas prices we received in  which reduced revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
dd a expenses for increased  or to  from  for as a percentage of revenues  dd a increased to compared to last year 
the dd a rate per ebo increase to for the year ended december  from for the same period of the increase in the dd a rate per ebo is attributable to an increase in net depletable property basis and a decrease in reserves as of december  impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  and  respectively  related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets was primarily the result of the effect of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices on both proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
we did not recognize an impairment in under full cost accounting rules  each quarter we are required to perform a ceiling test calculation 
the full cost pool carrying values cannot exceed a company s future net revenues from its proved reserves  discounted at per annum using constant current product prices  and the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
at december   oil and natural gas prices were lower compared with year end prices  resulting in an impairment charge to the full cost carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
the ceiling test was computed using the net present value of reserves at december  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this decrease was principally a result of a decrease in average borrowings from our revolving line of credit facility and lower interest rates 
income tax benefit expense 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of  this was due to the historical volatility in crude oil and gas prices  the uncertainty of future commodity prices  and our history of generating net losses 
management was unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all the available carryforwards prior to their ultimate expiration 
in the valuation allowance was reversed as we expected to be able to utilize the available carryforwards prior to their expiration due to the impending sale of our investment in first permian 
we recognized a tax expense in of  related to alternative minimum tax 
our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in due to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance provided in you should read note of the notes to the financial statements on page f  included in
