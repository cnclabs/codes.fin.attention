the corporate office of the company is located at the same site as the rmi g gardena  california facility 
description of business the company currently has ten manufacturing locations and was again listed by a plastics industry periodical as one of the top ten rotational molders in north america 
these operating divisions manufacture a variety of plastic products for commercial  agricultural  pharmaceutical  governmental  building  medical waste  refuse  retail  recreation  marine  healthcare and residential use  as well as a vast number of custom plastic products for a variety of industries  utilizing the rotonically molding process and  on a smaller scale  injection molding and dip molding processes 
in april  the injection molding process was added to the company s manufacturing operations as part of the rotocast merger 
utilizing this process  the company markets a variety of parts for commercial  promotional  and residential uses  under the trade names nutron and amp 
rotonically molding is a process for molding plastic resin by rotating a mold in a heated environment  while the plastic resin powder placed inside the mold melts and evenly coats the inner wall of the mold 
the injection molding process varies in that the plastic resin is first heated to a molten state and then injected under pressure into a mold 
the rotonically molding process has been used for many years and continues to be recognized as a growth industry in recent years  as a result of numerous ongoing business consolidations and the development of new resins 
these new resins allow rotonically molded items to compete with more traditional materials such as carbon  fiberglass  and stainless steel  especially in the fabrication of large  lightweight  one piece molded items  such as storage tanks and polysteel light poles 
rotonically molding is a particularly advantageous process for users of molded plastic products who may want to test different prototypes  or who do not require sufficient numbers of such products to justify a more expensive manufacturing process 
the company s products include various types of storage tanks  bin lids  refuse containers for automated removal  medical waste containers  agricultural livestock products  kayaks  outdoor polysteel lamp posts  furniture  planters  and other rotonically molded items 
the company purchases resin from five major suppliers in the us and canada 
there are nine additional suppliers of minor significance 
since the majority of the resin used in the manufacturing process is a polyethylene derived from natural gas  resin price is not directly related to the price for petrochemicals  and until recent years  has not generally been subject to volatile fluctuations  which are often experienced by the petroleum industry 
the company also incorporates the use of recycled plastic materials  blended with virgin materials in the manufacturing of products  whenever appropriate 
the company holds several patents on storage containers used for pharmaceutical  commercial and residential applications 
the patents expire through the year although the company has been able to capture its share of these niche markets and expects to see continued growth  no one patent or groups of patents is considered material to the business as a whole 
competition for the company s products is governed by geography and region  since large capacity tanks and bulky hollow products are expensive to ship long distances and  as such  any prospective competitor is constrained by shipping costs 
there are numerous single location  as well as a growing trend to structure multi location rotonically molding businesses throughout the united states 
however  each of these businesses still competes in a geographic region  which is determined by customer demand within that region  a constraint inherent to the industry 
due to its nationwide presence  the company has substantially alleviated this constraint 
the company s sales are usually not subject to large seasonal fluctuations as the business typically operates on significant backlogs with a diverse product mix 
peak season is usually experienced in the period from april through june 
historically  the quarter from january through march is the slowest production period of the year 
the company s backlog was  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the backlog orders as of june  are expected to be filled during fiscal the company s products are marketed through the in house sales and engineering staff  various distributors and outside commission based sales representatives 
the company continues to build a strong  broad and diverse customer base  which covers a multitude of industries 
since fiscal  no sales to any one single customer represented a material part of the company s business 
research and development expenditures for the company were insignificant for the last three fiscal years 
regulation the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  and does not anticipate any such laws will have material effect on its financial position  capital expenditures  or competitive position

the company maintains  for its respective employees who are eligible  a medical insurance plan some of which is contributory  a group life insurance plan  an annual bonus plan and a semi annual attendance bonus plan

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction to the extent that this k annual report discusses matters which are not historical  including statements regarding future financial results  information  or expectation about products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these include  among others  fluctuations in costs of raw materials and other expenses  costs associated with plant closures  downturns in the markets served by the company  the costs associated with new product introductions  as well as other factors described under the heading item  business  item  legal proceedings  under this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and footnote to financial statements 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our opinion only as of the date of the annual report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements after the date of this document 
you should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal operations net sales dropped to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal even though the company s diverse product offerings helped minimized sales volume deterioration  the country s general economic conditions continued to weigh heavily on the manufacturing sector 
the company s river waterways and specialty product groups reported the largest downturn  reflecting a and  respectively  reduction compared to last year sales volumes 
despite the overall drop in sales  material handling products posted a respectable increase over the prior year s sales volumes 
material handling continues to be a growth sector for the company as management continues to broaden its product offerings and target these specific niche markets 
management does not foresee future market conditions improving rapidly  but instead anticipates a slow  steady growth that will drive the economy during the next year 
this potential growth  along with projected business  including its marketing alliance with hadco  should help improve sales volumes in fiscal net sales dropped to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the million reduction in sales volumes in fiscal was attributed to the economic downturn in our country s manufacturing sector that has affected all of the company s product lines 
the company also realized heightened competition in reaction to these economic pressures  which further diminished sales volumes within the company s tank  bin lid and custom product lines 
in line with this  the company also lost market share  due to an unsuccessful refuse container bid  accounting for approximately million in sales reduction during the comparative period 
cost of goods was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the lackluster economy  management has been very proactive in its efforts to improve and sustain acceptable gross margins 
management was able to achieve this goal through improved efficiencies  streamlined operations and a reduction in its workforce during the year 
in addition  the company benefited from favorable resin prices and a reduction in natural gas costs of approximately  which had previously spiked dramatically in fiscal in contrast  fiscal margins were hampered by escalating raw material production costs  the spike in natural gas costs  as well as labor related insurance and fringe costs 
over the last several years  the roto molding industry continues to experience extreme volatility in plastic resin costs that can fluctuate within a short period of time 
the cost of plastic resin  utility costs and labor related costs  represent the major portion of the company s manufacturing costs  and have continually challenged the company to effectively manage its rising costs 
rising insurance costs also continue to be a concern  especially workers compensation  which increased by in fiscal  and will increase by approximately in fiscal during the years presented  the company has been relatively successful in mitigating these rising costs with ongoing sales price increases  improving manufacturing efficiencies and general cost containment efforts 
however  any further deterioration in market conditions  coupled with future increases in resin  utility and labor related costs  could hamper the company s goal to maintain consistent future operating results 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal the comparative percentage increase is attributed to the lower sales volumes 
however  overall sg a costs decreased by  which is primarily related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in the amount of  net of planned increases in marketing  wage and wage related costs of approximately  and an increase in bad debt expense of  sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal again  the comparative percentage increase is attributed to lower sales volumes 
however  overall sg a costs decreased by  the reduction is related to a significant reduction in selling costs  as a result of lower commissions and improved management of advertising  and tradeshow costs 
management continues to assess its marketing strategies to focus its resources and efforts in a manner that will optimize exposure for its various product groups 
income from operations was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating income in fiscal is primarily attributed to the improved gross margins as outlined above and the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the decrease in operating income in fiscal was attributed to the reduction in sales volumes consistent with the economic downturn  coupled with increased raw material  natural gas and labor related costs that dramatically increased during the period 
total interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the decrease is due to a significant reduction in the company s debt structure since june   which amounted to  coupled with the low interest rate environment throughout fiscal management anticipates these factors  along with a renegotiated interest rate swap agreement that took effect on august   will continue to have a positive effect on reducing future interest costs 
total interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal although operating results were lackluster  the company generated sufficient cash flows to decrease the company s total debt structure by approximately million in comparison to amounts outstanding as of june  this factor  along with negotiated rate reductions related to the company s bank debt and the drop in the federal discount rate in fiscal  was instrumental in reducing the company s interest costs 
income taxes were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the company s tax provision is the deferred tax component which amounted to   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
during the last three years  these amounts primarily relate to the utilization of the company s federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards and federal alternative tax amt credit carryforwards  and thus do not diminish current cash flow 
in fiscal  the company fully utilized its remaining federal nol carryforward  and in fiscal the company fully utilized its  federal amt credit caryforward 
after the utilization of the company s remaining amt credit carryforward in fiscal  the company incurred an increase in its current federal taxes 
current federal taxes amounted to  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
as such  the company s cash flow requirements will increase for the payment of current federal taxes in future periods 
net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill increased  to  or per common share  for fiscal compared to net income of  or per common share  in fiscal even though market conditions remained challenging in fiscal  management was pleased that it was able to minimize the deterioration of sales volumes in comparison to the prior year results 
these efforts  coupled with improved efficiencies  cost containment efforts  workforce reductions and the reductions relating to interest expense and goodwill previously mentioned  helped to successfully minimize the impact of these adverse market conditions  and ultimately resulted in the improvement in net income before the effect of the accounting change 
net income decreased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal  compared to net income of  or 
per common share  in fiscal the decrease is related to the reduction in sales volumes due to the tightening in the manufacturing sector coupled with the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  related to the escalating raw material  utility and labor related costs incurred during the period 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill the company recorded an adjustment effective july  to reflect the impact of adopting sfas no  amounting to a reduction of intangible assets of  this amount is reflected in net loss for the fiscal year ended june  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill 
the adjustment represents a write down of the company s net goodwill based on a review of the company s goodwill for impairment 
under the assessment guidelines of sfas no 
and the secs guidance that the company s quoted market price is the most efficient mechanism for estimating fair value  it was determined the fair value of the company s reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
although the assumptions used to estimate fair value may not be indicative of future results  the company s goodwill has been reduced to zero and will not require future impairment analysis 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the reduction is related to decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable consistent with current operations and management goals  an overall reduction in current deferred income taxes due to the utilization of federal tax credits  plus an increase of  for current income taxes payable and a  increase in current portion of debt relating to the real estate loan which was repaid in august cash flows from operations increased by  to  for fiscal  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase is related to the  improvement in net income before accounting change between the two periods  as well as  the cash flows generated from net reductions in inventories 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal although ebidta is not a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  it is a relevant internal measurement of the company s operations and cash flows 
as such  in spite of the on going challenges faced in fiscal  the company continues to generate sufficient cash flows from operations enabling the company to meet its working capital needs  service and reduce its debt  in fiscal  pay the 
per share common stock dividend declared in june and continue the common stock buyback program 
the company expended a total of  for property  plant and equipment during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the primary emphasis in fiscal was new tooling and tooling modifications  plus the addition of a new injection molding machine and mold shop equipment to increase productivity 
the company currently anticipates total capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal net borrowings under the line of credit decreased  to  between june  and june  the decrease is attributed to the excess cash flows from operations and the reduction in interest costs attributed to lower debt borrowings and favorable interest rates 
effective october   the bank extended the maturity date on the line of credit to october   and reduced the total borrowings available under the line of credit from  to  management agreed to the bank s request to reduce the line of credit borrowing limit after reviewing current cash flow projections  which do not currently forecast requirements to exceed the revised  limit 
management and the bank agreed verbally that the borrowing limit would revert back to its original amount  if circumstances arose that would warrant the need for additional borrowings 
management also decided not to advance on the  term loan commitment  and instead requested the bank to issue a new term loan commitment in the amount of  which will expire on october  the following is a summary of the company s contractual commitments associated with its debt and lease obligations as of june  for the year ended june  thereafter total principle payments term debt operating leases total commitments during fiscal  the company reinstated its common stock buyback program 
in fiscal  the company acquired  shares of common stock at a total cost of  the company plans to continue to actively acquire its common shares as long as the market value per share continues to be under recognized by the stock market 
as of june   the company had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of 
a increase over the prior year per common share  which was paid on july   to stockholders of record on july  this marks the sixth payment of dividends since on the company s stock 
the board of directors is committed to annually review a dividend program for the company s common stock 
cash flows from operations in conjunction with the company s revolving line of credit and machinery and equipment loan commitment are expected to meet the company s needs for working capital  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and repayment of long term debt for the foreseeable future 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved two new pronouncements sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
sfas no 
applies to all business combinations with a closing date after june  this statement eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting and further clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
identifiable intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective july   which required the company to cease amortization of its remaining net goodwill balance and to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test as of july  and thereafter an impairment test at least annually and record an adjustment when the fair value of our reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying value 
the company was permitted six months from the adoption date to complete a review of goodwill for impairment and record necessary adjustments prior to the end of fiscal the company engaged a national valuation specialist to assist with the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
to determine fair value  valuation models  including guideline public companies  acquisition analysis and discounted cash flows were relied upon 
as such  under the assessment guidelines of sfas no 
and the sec s guidance that the company s quoted market price is the most efficient mechanism for estimating fair value  their findings indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 and wrote off its remaining net goodwill of  as a non cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective july  goodwill amortization expense was  for fiscal years and in september  the fasb approved sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as well as accounting principle board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
not only retains the requirements of sfas no 
to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  but also establishes a single accounting method for assets to be disposed of and broadens the presentation of discounted operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial portion or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and requires these costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation 
the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company makes various estimates when applying accounting policies in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap that affect its consolidated financial statements 
due to the nature of the company s business  these estimates generally are not considered highly uncertain at the time of estimation and therefore are not expected to result in a period to period change that would materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company does apply key accounting principles as required by gaap 
these key accounting policies govern allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based on a percentage of net sales and a specific review of all significant outstanding receivable balances 
percentages applied may vary based on analysis of historical collection experience or current economic trends 
if the data the company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the results of operations could be affected 
inventory valuation finished goods inventory is valued at cost and management uses historical gross margin trends and other estimates to continually update labor and overhead allocations 
the gross margin percentage reflects our estimate of the cost of  among other things  material  labor and overhead expenditures during the production process 
such cost are capitalized to inventory as products are manufactured 
although it is believed that the estimates are reasonable  it is possible that the actual labor and overhead costs will differ over time from the estimated amounts 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on the current amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes see note 
the company bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases expectations about future outcomes 
the company s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in particular  the company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net income for the period in which such determination is made 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing economic environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
economic  political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth 
our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for plastic products for commercial  recreational and residential uses 
because our sales are primarily to corporate and government customers  our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
the general weakening of the global economy and the weakening of business conditions in the manufacturing industry  as well as governmental budgetary constraints  has resulted in a decreased demand for our products 
if demand for our products continues to be weak  our revenue growth rates will be adversely affected 
in addition  terrorist attacks upon the united states have contributed to economic  political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business will continue to be adversely affected 
management has no comparative advantage in forecasting macroeconomic trends and developments relating to general business conditions 
our management is  however  required to make such forecasts in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  because we are either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or of a sector  our performance can suffer because of a failure properly to match corporate strategy with economic conditions 
if we do not successfully manage our operating margins  our business can be negatively impacted 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to forecast revenues accurately and control expenses 
while we can control certain internal factors  our future operating results can be adversely impacted by external factors  such as a slowing in demand for certain of our products 
if there is an unexpected decline in revenues  which is not offset by a decrease in expenses  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we may be required to change our business practices if there are changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies 
policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  income taxes  facilities consolidation  accounting for acquisitions  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments as to complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards groups and regulators 
these standard groups and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse  changes to our accounting policies 
business disruptions could affect our future operating results 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event  such as the recent terrorist attacks upon the united states 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in  california experienced ongoing power shortages  which resulted in rolling blackouts 
these blackouts  blackouts in other regions or procedures implemented to avert blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of our customers
