item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion includes certain forward looking statements about kronos business and its expectations  including statements relating to revenues derived from prior acquisitions  product and service revenues and revenue growth rates  deferred maintenance revenue  gross profit  operating expenses  future acquisitions and available cash  investments and operating cash flow and the future effects of accounting pronouncements 
any such statements are subject to risk that could cause the actual results to vary materially from expectations 
for a further discussion of the various risks that may affect kronos business and expectations  see certain factors that may affect future operating results at the end of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon kronos consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires kronos to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
kronos bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
kronos has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of kronos accounting policies 
please refer to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
revenue recognition the company licenses software and sells data collection hardware and related ancillary products to end user customers through its direct sales force as well as indirect channel customers  adp and its independent resellers 
substantially all of the company s software license revenue is earned from perpetual licenses of off the shelf software requiring no modification or customization 
the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary product revenues from the company s end user customers and indirect channel customers are generally recognized using the residual method when o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a non cancelable sales and software license agreement has been signed  o delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  o the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  o collectibility is probable  and o vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  typically maintenance and professional services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
substantially all of the company s product revenue is recognized in this manner 
if the company cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  the company will defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  end user customers typically purchase maintenance and support contracts as well as professional services from the company 
maintenance and support services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if the company makes them generally available 
professional services are deemed to be non essential and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of the data collection hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data  and assisting in the development and documentation of pay rules and best practices consulting 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance and support services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
the company has classified the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to the contractual maintenance and support obligations that exist for the month period subsequent to the balance sheet date as a current liability  and the contractual obligations with a term beyond months as a non current liability 
revenues from time and material support services are recognized as the services are delivered 
revenues from professional services are generally recognized based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  and the professional services have been delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately and are typically an hourly rate for professional services and a per class rate for training 
based upon the company s experience in completing product implementations  it has determined that these services are typically delivered within a month period subsequent to the contract signing and therefore classifies deferred professional services as a current liability 
the company s arrangements with its end user customers and indirect channel customers do not include any rights of return or price protection  nor do arrangements with indirect channel customers include any acceptance provisions 
generally  the company s arrangements with end user customers also do not include any acceptance provisions 
however  if an arrangement does include acceptance provisions  they typically are based on the company s standard acceptance provision 
the company s standard acceptance provision provides the end user customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet kronos published specifications 
generally  the company determines that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with sfas no 
at the time the company enters into an arrangement  the company assesses the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
for end user customers  the company s typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments  based on specific due dates  such that all payments for the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  as well as services included in the original arrangement are ordinarily due within one year of contract signing 
the company s payment terms for its indirect channel customers are less than days and typically due within days of invoice date 
if the payment terms for the arrangement are considered extended or if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  the company defers revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under sop and classifies this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
this revenue is recognized  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due and or when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
the company reports the allocated fair value of revenues related to the product element of arrangements as a current liability because of the expectation that these revenues will be recognized within months of the balance sheet date 
since fiscal  the company has had a standard practice of providing creditworthy end user customers the option of financing arrangements beyond one year 
these arrangements  which encompass separate fees for software license  data collection hardware and ancillary products  maintenance and support contracts and professional services  are evidenced by distinct standard sales  license and maintenance agreements and typically require equal monthly payments 
the term of these arrangements typically range between and months 
at the time the company enters into an arrangement  the company assesses the probability of collection and whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
the company considers its history of collection without concessions as well as whether each new transaction involves similar customers  products and arrangement economics to ensure that the history developed under previous arrangements remains relevant to current arrangements 
if the fee is not determined to be collectible  fixed or determinable  the company will initially defer the revenue and recognize when collection becomes probable  which typically is when payment is due assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance kronos maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on estimates made by kronos after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
in addition  kronos maintains a sales returns allowance to reflect estimated losses for sales returns and adjustments 
sales returns and adjustments are generally due to incorrect ordering of product  general customer satisfaction issues or incorrect billing 
this allowance is established by kronos using estimates based on historical experience 
if kronos experiences an increase in sales returns and adjustments  additional allowances and charges against revenue may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  kronos must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  kronos may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  kronos will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit which houses goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
kronos has only one reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
during the three month period ended march   the company completed the initial testing of the impairment of goodwill  as of october  as a result of the test  the company has concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed as of october  in addition  during the three month period ended september   the company completed its annual testing of the impairment of goodwill  as of july  as a result of the test  the company has concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed as of july  therefore  as a result of these impairment tests  no impairment was recorded in fiscal capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized and amortized to product cost of sales on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic lives of the respective products  beginning when the products are offered for sale 
costs incurred in the development of software for internal use are charged to expense until it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be realized 
thereafter  certain costs are capitalized and amortized to operating expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic life of the software 
results of operations revenues 
revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
annual revenue growth amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the revenue growth experienced in fiscal was attributable to the effect of incremental revenues derived from customers obtained from acquisitions of businesses over the preceding four quarters and core business growth resulting from increased demand for kronos services 
revenues from core business grew and revenues attributable to acquisitions contributed of revenue growth in fiscal in fiscal  revenues from core business grew and revenue attributable to acquisitions contributed of revenue growth 
management presently anticipates that revenue growth  including revenues from customers obtained in the acquisition of businesses  will range between for fiscal product revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
product revenues increased in fiscal  in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal the product revenue growth experienced in fiscal was attributable to revenues related to the conversion to kronos products by  and add on sales to  customers acquired from other providers of labor management solutions 
product revenue derived from acquired customers was million during fiscal management believes that the decline in product revenues  excluding incremental product revenue from acquired customers  is attributable to the continued economic downturn resulting in many customers deferring or reducing their technology purchases 
while management believes the impact on technology purchasing may be temporary  the effect may continue to cause delays or reductions in customer purchases of kronos products and services in the future 
the product growth during fiscal was primarily attributable to increased product sales volume as a result of customer demand for platform and capacity upgrades from existing customers and demand for kronos new products  and to a lesser extent  revenues from customers obtained from acquisitions of businesses 
the discontinuance of maintenance on dos and unix products  which was effective october   contributed to this increase in product revenue as customers transitioned from those platforms 
service revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenues grew in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
service revenues amounted to  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenue derived from acquired customers was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in addition to the acquisition of businesses  the growth in service revenues in each of the fiscal years presented reflected an increase in maintenance revenues from the expansion of the installed base and the value of services sold to the installed base  as well as an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and platform upgrade sales 
the expansion of the installed base resulted from the cumulative effect of adding new sales to the base  and the acquisition of resellers and other companies 
the increase in the value of services sold to the installed base was principally attributable to the platform upgrade of existing customers to kronos new products 
platform and capacity upgrade sales generally result in an increased value of maintenance contracts and level of professional service revenues 
the growth in fiscal and service revenues also reflected the increase in delivery of professional services resulting from improving the efficiency of kronos service organization 
deferred maintenance revenues increased from september  current deferred maintenance revenues increased and long term deferred maintenance revenues decreased from september  the decrease in the long term portion was due to kronos decision to curtail the practice of selling multi year maintenance contracts 
kronos management does not anticipate significant reductions in the growth rate of deferred maintenance in the foreseeable future 
deferred professional services revenues increased from september  international revenues  which include revenues from kronos international subsidiaries and sales to independent international resellers  amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues grew by in fiscal years and  and in fiscal international revenues amounted to of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal years and  and in fiscal management anticipates overall gross profit to decline in fiscal as more revenue derives from newer products including its kronos terminal and human resources management system hrms products  which carry higher royalty and production costs  and as kronos increases its investment in infrastructure to support the introduction of its hrms products 
in addition  if service revenues continue to grow proportionately faster than product revenues  gross margins may decrease as service revenues have a lower gross profit 
product gross profit as a percentage of product revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in product gross profit is primarily related to higher royalty and software amortization costs as well as higher production costs attributable to the kronos terminal and related modules 
partially offsetting this decrease is a higher proportion of software sales  which typically carry a higher gross profit than hardware sales 
the software component of product revenue increased to of total product revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
service gross profit as a percentage of service revenues was in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in service gross profit for each fiscal year presented is primarily attributable to increased productivity in the service organization 
the improvement in productivity was the result of leveraging investments in service systems to more effectively manage the resources required to deliver professional services and customer support 
in fiscal and  the company implemented systems that improved visibility to the current professional services and training revenue backlog and allowed service managers to more effectively schedule resources 
net operating expenses 
net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the special charges recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal and the elimination of goodwill amortization due to kronos adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  see note g in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on a proforma basis  excluding the special charge and amortization expense  net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
although management intends to decrease operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  principally through productivity improvements  uncertainty related to the economic outlook and its impact on the timing of customers purchases  as well as increased investment in infrastructure to support the introduction of the new hrms products may prevent decreases as a percentage of revenues from being realized 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and in both fiscal and sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in all periods presented is attributable to kronos investments in sales personnel and related support costs to maximize the penetration of existing accounts and to add new customers as well as initiatives to expand market awareness of kronos products and services 
the impact of converting kronos reseller operations to direct sales operations also contributed to the increase to a lesser extent 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was primarily due to leveraging our investment in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes 
engineering  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in all fiscal years presented 
engineering  research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses are net of capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in engineering expenses in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses for additional engineering personnel partially offset by a reduction in spending related to contract consultants 
the significant project development efforts in fiscal principally related to further development and enhancement of the workforce central r suite  kronos iseries central suite  kronos tm terminal and  to a lesser extent  the eforce r software acquired from simplexgrinnell on december  in addition  during fiscal  kronos initiated its development of its newest product suite  workforce hr tm and workforce payroll tm 
the growth in engineering  research and development expenses in fiscal resulted principally from the development of new web based software applications and hardware products 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and as compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for administrative  information technology  finance  legal and human resources support functions 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily due to kronos investment in personnel and other infrastructure to support the growth of operations 
amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in amortization is the result of the elimination of goodwill amortization described above 
other income  net as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and in fiscal and other income  net is principally interest income earned from kronos cash as well as investments in its marketable securities and financing arrangements 
prior year special charge 
a special charge in the amount of million was recorded in fiscal approximately million of the special charge was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal related to the termination of kronos crosswinds technology operations 
the crosswinds technology group  which was purchased in may  was responsible for the product development  marketing and sales support of time and attendance applications that operated as a microsoft outlook plug in product 
lower than anticipated sales of these applications  redundant infrastructure and ongoing operating losses resulted in the termination of the stand alone operating unit 
the million charge consisted of million in termination costs  million for the write off of intangible assets and million in other costs 
approximately million of the special charge was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal related to termination costs from a reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
this charge was the result of management s effort to streamline operations to better align costs with expected revenues 
as of september   kronos did not have any remaining liability related to the special charge 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was in fiscal years and  and in fiscal kronos effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  including income tax credits  amortization of goodwill for tax purposes  foreign tax rate differentials and state income taxes 
newly issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas and sfas under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the fasb statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   the company applied the new rules on accounting for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for acquisitions completed after june   kronos applied the new rules beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal on a pro forma basis  kronos would have realized an increase in net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal  and million  or per diluted share for fiscal if these new standards had been applied to fiscal and in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this fasb statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas is effective for kronos beginning on october   and will not have a material effect on its earnings or financial position 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred formerly eitf abstracts  topic no 
d 
this eitf requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the income statement as opposed to a reduction of expenses incurred 
out of pocket expenses include travel expenses such as airfare  hotel  mileage and meals that the customer will reimburse the service vendor 
as a result of kronos adoption of the eitf  service revenues and the corresponding cost of sales increased by million in fiscal  and by million in fiscal the financial statements included in this annual report and or form k reflect this new classification 
liquidity and capital resources kronos funds its business through cash generated by operations 
if near term demand for kronos products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the availability of such funds may be adversely impacted 
if the need arose  kronos believes that based on its current debt free balance sheet and its financial position  it would be successful in securing financing from the capital markets 
working capital as of september  amounted to million as compared with million at september  this decrease in working capital is primarily due to cash spent on the acquisition of businesses and software and the purchase of treasury stock during fiscal during fiscal  working capital was reduced as kronos used available cash of million to complete acquisitions of businesses with minimal net working capital and to purchase the abra enterprise human resources and payroll software hrms technology 
in addition  kronos completed repurchases of its common shares of approximately million during fiscal of this amount  approximately million was for share repurchases pursuant to kronos stock repurchase program  and million was related to the purchase of stock held for at least six months from employees related to the exercise of stock options 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  increased to million from million at september  cash provided by operations amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal is principally attributable to an increase in net income  collection of accounts receivable from trade customers and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
these are partially offset by a reduced rate of increase in kronos deferred revenues as well as an increase in cash used due to timing of compensation related payments 
the growth rate of deferred professional services at september  declined from that experienced in the prior year principally due to more timely delivery of professional services resulting from an increase in service delivery personnel as well as increased productivity in the service organization 
similar to the prior year  deferred maintenance revenues decreased in comparison to the prior year as a result of kronos fiscal business decision to reduce the availability of multi year maintenance contracts to customers 
although kronos foregoes the cash received when multi year contracts are accepted  management believes the loss of cash is offset by better economics achieved on annual maintenance renewals due to reduced selling costs and maintenance contract discounts 
in addition  kronos receives a corresponding cash benefit resulting from the tax treatment of the annual maintenance contracts as kronos remits income taxes on maintenance contracts in the year the monies are received  which  in the case of multi year maintenance contracts  results in more income taxes paid in the first year of the maintenance contract as compared to annual maintenance contracts 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal was principally attributable to increased accrued compensation and collection of accounts receivable from trade customers as well as the reduction to kronos deferred tax asset related to multi year maintenance contracts 
the reduction in multi year maintenance contracts creates a cash benefit as less cash is required to be remitted for tax purposes 
also contributing to the increase in cash flows during fiscal were non cash charges related to the special charges recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal as well as the non cash charges related to deprecation and amortization 
these factors are partially offset by a reduced rate of increase in kronos deferred maintenance revenues as a result of kronos fiscal business decision to reduce the availability of multi year maintenance contracts to customers 
cash used for property  plant and equipment was million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
kronos use of cash for property  plant and equipment in all periods presented includes investments in information system and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
in fiscal  kronos investment included the development and construction of its corporate headquarters campus 
kronos use of cash for the acquisition of businesses and software in fiscal was principally related to the acquisitions of specified assets and or businesses of kronos dealers and or other providers of labor management solutions as well as the acquisition of the source code license for the hrms technology 
kronos is assessing several acquisition opportunities that may be completed over the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be completed 
excess cash reserves not required for operations  investments in property  plant and equipment or acquisitions are invested in marketable securities 
net investments in marketable securities increased by million in fiscal compared to an increase of million in fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal under kronos stock repurchase program  kronos repurchased  common shares during fiscal at a cost of million compared to  common shares at a cost of million in fiscal and  shares at a cost of million in fiscal the common shares repurchased under the program are used for kronos employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by operations was sufficient to fund investments in capitalized software development costs  property  plant and equipment and stock repurchases 
kronos leases certain office space  manufacturing facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases with noncancellable terms of one year or more are as follows in thousands operating lease fiscal year commitments thereafter  kronos believes that with cash generated from ongoing operations it has adequate cash and investments and operating cash flow to fund its investments in property  plant and equipment  software development costs  cash requirements under operating leases  cash payments related to acquisitions  if any  and any additional stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  kronos did not engage in o material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities  o material trading activities in non exchange traded commodity contracts  or o transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with kronos 
certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in the annual report and or form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
kronos desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
kronos actual operating results may differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and or form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time because of a number of factors including the potential fluctuations in quarterly results  timing and acceptance of new product introductions by kronos and its competitors  the dependence on kronos time and attendance product line  the ability to attract and retain sufficient technical personnel  the protection of kronos intellectual property and the potential infringement on kronos intellectual property rights  competitive pricing pressure  and the dependence on alternate distribution channels and on key vendors  as further described below 
potential fluctuations in results 
kronos operating results  including revenue growth  sources of revenue  effective tax rate and liquidity  may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the purchasing patterns of its customers  mix of products and services sold  the ability of kronos to effectively integrate acquired businesses into kronos operations  the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by kronos and its competitors  the strategy employed by kronos to enter the human resources management system hrms market  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing pressure and general economic conditions 
kronos historically has realized a relatively larger percentage of its annual revenues and profits in the fourth quarter and a relatively smaller percentage in the first quarter of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  substantially all of kronos product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for kronos products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  kronos revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
kronos believes that its operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
product development and technological change 
continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology characterize the markets for labor management systems 
kronos future success will depend largely on its ability to enhance the capabilities and increase the performance of its existing products and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
although kronos is continually seeking to further enhance its product offerings including products for the hrms market and to develop new products and interfaces  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that kronos competitors will not develop and market products which are superior to kronos products or achieve greater market acceptance 
dependence on time and attendance product line 
to date  more than of kronos revenues have been attributable to sales of time and attendance systems and related services 
although kronos has introduced its products for the licensed hrms market during fiscal  kronos expects that its dependence on the time and attendance product line for revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause kronos time and attendance products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of kronos operations 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
kronos markets and sells its products through its direct sales organization  independent resellers and its oem partner  adp 
in fiscal  approximately of kronos revenue was generated through sales to resellers and adp 
management does not anticipate that its entrance into the hrms market will have a negative impact on its relationship with adp 
however  a reduction in the sales efforts of kronos major resellers and or adp  or termination or changes in their relationships with kronos  could have a material adverse effect on the results of kronos operations 
competition 
the labor management industry is highly competitive 
technological changes such as those allowing for increased use of the internet have resulted in new entrants into the market 
although kronos believes it has core competencies that position it strongly in the marketplace  maintaining kronos technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment by kronos in research and development and marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that kronos will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain its competitive advantages 
increased competition could adversely affect kronos operating results through price reductions and or loss of market share 
with kronos efforts to expand its labor management offering with the recent introduction of its hrms product suite  kronos will continue to meet strong competition 
many of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their hrms products 
many of kronos hrms competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than kronos  as well as more experience in delivering hrms solutions 
there can be no assurance that kronos will be able to compete successfully in the hrms marketplace  and its failure to do so could have a material adverse impact upon its business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
kronos has encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expects such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect kronos ability to produce  support and sell products in a timely manner 
protection of intellectual property 
kronos has developed  and through its acquisitions of businesses and software  acquired proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
kronos success is dependent upon its ability to further develop and protect its proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
kronos seeks to protect products  software  documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
while kronos has attempted to safeguard and maintain its proprietary rights  it is unknown whether kronos has been or will be successful in doing so 
despite kronos efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of kronos products is difficult 
while kronos is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
kronos can offer no assurance that it can adequately protect its proprietary rights or that its competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology 
infringement of intellectual property rights 
kronos cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that kronos developed or acquired intellectual property rights are infringing on their intellectual property rights or that kronos does not in fact infringe on those intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of kronos management and key personnel from business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require kronos to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  and in this event  kronos may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
kronos may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction against the use of its products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against kronos could cause immediate and substantial damage to its business and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments  foreign currency fluctuations and decreases in its common stock price affecting capped call options 
refer to note a summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding marketable securities  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and capped call option arrangements 
the company s marketable securities that expose it to market rate risks are comprised of debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates would not adversely impact interest income or related cash flows pertaining to securities held at september   as all of these securities have fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not adversely impact the fair value of these securities by a material amount due to the size and average duration of the portfolio 
the company s exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency relate primarily to the amounts due from subsidiaries 
exchange gains and losses related to amounts due from subsidiaries have not been material 
for foreign currency exposures existing at september   a unfavorable movement in the foreign exchange rates for each subsidiary location would not expose the company to material losses in earnings or cash flows 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
kronos periodically enters into short term capped call options in conjunction with its stock repurchase initiatives 
the company s exposure to a decrease in the closing price of kronos common stock at september  would not expose kronos to material losses in earnings or cash flows
