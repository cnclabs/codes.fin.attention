item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements about us within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include information concerning our future financial condition and business strategy 
statements that contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  prospects  estimates  should  may or similar expressions are forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
while we believe these expectations and projections are reasonable  forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us 
the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
overview in connection with the april  transactions  pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the group  formerly known as tenneco packaging inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco  inc from its formation in january and through the closing of the acquisition on april   pca did not have any significant operations 
accordingly  the historical financial results for periods prior to april  described below are those of the group 
the group operated prior to april  as a division of pactiv  and not as a separate  stand alone entity 
as a result  the historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect what the group s financial position and results of operations would have been had the group been operated as a separate  stand alone entity during the periods prior to april  the april  acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets 
purchase accounting was not applied because  under the applicable accounting guidance  a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 
general containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity 
according to pulp paper week  after giving effect to price decreases in  average prices in december for linerboard and corrugating medium were and lower  respectively  than december prices 
pulp paper week  in its february  publication  reported that prices for linerboard and corrugating medium decreased per ton  or  and per ton  or  respectively  compared to december levels 
the march  pulp paper week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from february levels

total corrugated products volume decreased to billion square feet in compared to billion square feet in on a comparable shipment per workday basis  corrugated products volume decreased in from the larger percentage decrease was due to the fact that had one more workday  those days not falling on a weekend or holiday  than containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers decreased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in the comparable period of according to pulp paper week  average industry mid point linerboard and semi chemical medium prices for lb

gross profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from of sales in to of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   increased by million  or  from the year ended december  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily due to prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  net sales net sales increased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the pro forma year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard to third parties 
corrugated products volume was essentially flat in compared to record volume in of billion square feet

operating income results for both years exclude fourth quarter gains on timberland sales of million and million for and  respectively 
gross profit increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the pro forma year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from of sales in to of sales in primarily due to the sales price increases described above 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  from the pro forma year ended december  the reduction primarily reflects the difference in cost between the overhead charged to the group by tenneco and pactiv and overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended december  included three and one half months of corporate overhead  through april   charged by tenneco and pactiv and eight and one half months of corporate overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable pro forma period in  primarily due to prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the pro forma year ended december  the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to lower income 
cash flow provided by operating activities increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable pro forma period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income 
investing activities cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the change was primarily attributable to a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales of million 
cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales 
as of december   pca had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 
financing activities cash used for financing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily reflecting decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements 
cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december   primarily reflecting increased prepayments made by pca on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
prior to the transactions as a division of pactiv  the group did not maintain separate cash accounts other than for petty cash 
the group s disbursements for payroll  capital projects  operating supplies and expenses were processed and funded by pactiv through centrally managed accounts 
in addition  cash receipts from the collection of accounts receivable and the sales of assets were remitted directly to bank accounts controlled by pactiv 
because of pactiv s centrally managed cash system  in which the cash receipts and disbursements of pactiv s various divisions were commingled  it was not feasible to segregate cash received from pactiv  such as financing for the business  from cash transmitted to pactiv  such as a distribution 
accordingly  the net effect of these cash transactions with pactiv is represented as a single line item within the financing section of the statement of cash flows 
similarly  the activity of the interdivision account presents the net transfer of funds and charges between pactiv and the group as a single line item 
since april   pca has maintained its own cash accounts 
after the transactions following the transactions  pca s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under pca s revolving credit facility 
pca s primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures 
pca expects to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these sources 
pca incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the transactions 
on april   pca had approximately  million of indebtedness outstanding which included  million of senior secured bank debt and million of subordinated notes 
in addition to the indebtedness  pca also had million of preferred stock as of april  concurrently with the transactions  pca issued the notes and preferred stock and entered into the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility initially provided for three term loans in an aggregate amount of  million and a revolving credit facility with up to million in availability 
upon the closing of the acquisition  pca borrowed the full amount available under the term loans and million under the senior revolving credit facility  the latter of which was repaid immediately thereafter 
in october and november  pca completed the sales of approximately  acres of timberland 
total proceeds received from the sales were million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
effective december   pca elected to reduce its availability under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
on june   pca completed the refinancing of its million senior credit facility 
on january   pca became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its common stock 
on march   pca used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock due on november   pca completed the sale of approximately  acres of timberland to southern timber venture  llc 
pca received million in cash and a equity ownership interest in southern timber venture  llc 
pca recorded a pre tax gain of million  and a portion of the gain was not recognized as a result of pca s continuing ownership interest 
on november   pca established an on balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable 
to effectuate this program  pca formed a wholly owned limited purpose subsidiary  packaging credit company  llc  or pcc  which in turn formed a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary  packaging receivables company  llc  or prc  for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc 
both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca 
under this program  pcc purchases on an ongoing basis all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc 
prc and lenders established a million receivables backed revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc 
the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc 
in the event of a liquidation of prc  the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca 
credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing base formula 
as a result  the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times 
as of december   million was outstanding and million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility 
the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal was million 
the following table provides the outstanding balance and the weighted average interest rate as of december  for each of pca s outstanding term loans  the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility borrowing arrangement in thousands balance at december  weighted average interest rate term loan a  term loan b  senior revolving credit facility revolver eurodollar n a revolver base rate n a receivables credit facility  total  the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to fund pca s working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the term loan a must be repaid in quarterly installments from december through the term loan b must be repaid in quarterly installments from march through the senior revolving credit facility will terminate in the receivables credit facility will terminate in in  and  pca made prepayments totaling approximately million  million  and million  respectively  using free cash flow from operations of million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans and variable rate debt 
the instruments governing pca s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  incur liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca 
these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 
in addition  we must maintain minimum debt service  minimum net worth and maximum leverage ratios under the senior credit facility 
a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default  which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness 
such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility 
pca estimates that it will make approximately million in capital expenditures in these expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital  cost reduction  business growth  and environmental compliance 
pca believes that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months  and that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the senior revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
pca s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service  extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond pca s control 
environmental matters we are subject to  and must comply with  a variety of federal  state and local environmental laws  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
because environmental regulations are constantly evolving  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  costs to maintain compliance with those laws 
in particular  the epa recently finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations  including those at the counce  filer city  valdosta and tomahawk mills 
over the next several years  the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants  and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 
as is the case with any industrial operation  we have  in the past  incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination  as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as the federal superfund law  and analogous state laws 
cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate  former facilities and off site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre closing off site waste disposal 
pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city  michigan unrelated to current mill operations 
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict  meaning that liability is imposed without fault  joint and several  meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution  and retroactive  we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material 
from january through december  remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about million 
as of december   we maintained an environmental reserve of million  which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as on going and anticipated remedial projects 
total capital costs for environmental matters  including cluster rule compliance  were million for and we currently estimate environmental expenditures will be million  of which million of the expenditures are to meet to cluster rule requirements 
impact of inflation pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  pensions and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit sources  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due ranging from for current amounts to for amounts more than days past due based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserves was million  compared to million at december  bad debt expense decreased million  or  from million to million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to specific accounts deemed uncollectable in for the year ended december  bad debt expenses increased million  or  from the pro forma year ended december  due to specific accounts deemed uncollectable in inventory we record our inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long term debt 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we do not speculate in derivatives trading 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
to hedge interest rate risk  interest rate collars are used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and cash payments 
the cash receipts and cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves 
we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in addition to the above derivative financial instruments  we have other contracts covering a portion of our purchases of natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of derivatives but are not required to be accounted for as derivatives 
these contracts for the physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal purchases exception under statement as we take physical delivery of the item and use it in the production process 
this exception is an election and  if not elected  these contracts would be carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income 
these contracts cover natural gas and electricity usage at our mills through at december   estimated future payments under these contracts amounted to million 
environmental liabilities the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date 
amounts are estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not discounted 
the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs  the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  and the timing  varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies 
liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions 
because of these uncertainties  however  our estimates may change 
we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the transactions  pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre closing offsite waste disposal 
pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 
debt covenants our senior credit facility requires us to maintain minimum debt service  minimum net worth  and maximum leverage ratios as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default  which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness 
due to cross default provisions contained in the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility  all of our debt would become due in full if any of our debt is in default 
given our results of our operations for and our projections for future operating results  the likelihood of our defaulting on our debt covenants is unlikely absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
we also believe our lenders would provide us waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with our debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved and our debt is placed in default  we would experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation were required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write down to discounted cash flows were required 
new accounting standards for a description of changes in accounting principles affecting pca  see note to pca s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk while part of tenneco  pca has not had any material market risk due to the fact that its debt financing and risk management activities were conducted by pactiv or tenneco 
as a result of the april transactions  pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement dated as of april   pca was required to maintain for at least two years after the closing of the transactions interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum interest rate with respect to at least of the outstanding term loans under the senior credit agreement 
upon the refinancing of the senior credit agreement on june   this requirement was deleted 
pca currently has interest rate collar agreements that protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest rate 
the original notional amount of these collar agreements was million 
as pca has made debt prepayments  the need for these collar agreements has diminished 
accordingly  pca has reduced the notional amount of the collars to million as of december  the weighted average floor of the interest rate collar agreements is and the weighted average ceiling of the interest rate collar agreements is 
the interest rate on approximately of pca s variable rate debt at december  is capped 
pca receives payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate libor or commercial paper exceeds the ceiling 
correspondingly  pca makes payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate drops below the floor 
in both cases  the amounts received or paid are based upon the notional amount and the difference between the actual interest rate and the ceiling or floor rate 
the weighted average duration of the interest rate collar agreements is approximately months 
as a result of the collar agreements noted above and the interest rate environment  a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately million and million annually for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the weighted average libor was and  respectively  and the weighted average commercial paper rate was and  respectively 
the effect of an interest rate change to the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant 
this analysis does not consider any other impact on fair market value that could exist in such an interest rate environment 
in the event of a change in interest rates  management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca s financial structure
