item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations ffo and ebitda 
ffo is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales or write down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ffo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities  extraordinary items  gain loss on sale of assets  preferred dividends and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences ffo 
the most important component in determining ebitda and ffo is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rents will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for the year ended december  also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

the properties acquired by pprt and the management companies joint venture acquisitions are reflected using the equity method of accounting 
the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies 
macerich financial statements many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the acquisition centers and the partial sale and contribution of the contributed jv assets to pprt during many factors impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties  including the availability and cost of capital  the overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria 
there were no acquisitions in or because of market conditions  including the cost of capital and the lack of attractive opportunities 
accordingly  management is uncertain whether in future years that there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the acquisition centers 
pacific view formerly known as buenaventura mall  crossroads mall boulder and parklane mall are currently under redevelopment or in the case of pacific view  was recently redeveloped and are referred to herein as the redevelopment centers 
all other centers  excluding the redevelopment centers  are referred to herein as the same centers  unless the context otherwise requires 
revenues include rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents which requires rent to be recognized each year in an amount equal to the average rent over the term of the lease  including fixed rent increases over that period 
the amount of straight lined rents  included in consolidated revenues  recognized in was million compared to million in and million in additionally  the company recognized through equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures  million as its pro rata share of straight lined rents from joint ventures in compared to million in and million in these decreases resulted from the company structuring the majority of its new leases using annual consumer price index cpi increases  which generally do not require straight lining treatment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
the company s historical growth in revenues  net income and funds from operations have been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers 
many factors  including those described above  will affect the company s ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future 
in addition  the following describes some of the other significant factors that could impact the company s future results of operations 
general factors affecting the centers  competition real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of the centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses  including debt service  lease payments  capital expenditures and tenant improvements  and to make distributions to their owners and the company s stockholders 
income from shopping center properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national economic climate  the regional and local economy which may be adversely impacted by plant closings  industry slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  terrorist activities  and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  retail space or retail goods and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and increased costs of maintenance  insurance and operations including real estate taxes 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the centers in attracting tenants to lease space  and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers that compete with the centers for retail sales see macerich financial statements business competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenues 
income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax  environmental  safety and zoning laws see business environmental matters  interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing 
dependence on tenants the company s revenues and funds available for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company s lessees were unable due to poor operating results  bankruptcy or other reasons to meet their obligations  if the company were unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms  or if for any reason  the company were unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments 
a decision by an anchor or another significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry could result in the loss of tenants at one or more centers 
see business bankruptcy and or closure of retail stores 
furthermore  if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers were to decline sufficiently  tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges 
in the event of a default by a lessee  the center may also experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor 
assets and liabilities total assets decreased to  million at december  compared to  million at december  and  million at december  during that same period  total liabilities decreased from  million in to  million in and decreased to  million in these changes were primarily a result of the partial sale and contribution of the contributed jv assets to pprt  the sale of villa marina marketplace and related debt transactions

included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for   for and  for the decline in straight lining of rents from to is due to the company structuring its new leases using rent increases tied to the change in cpi rather than using contractually fixed rent increases 
cpi increases do not generally require straight lining of rent treatment 
inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease macerich financial statements term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  plus the change in accounting principle discussed below for percentage rent  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
statement on critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgements on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectable accounts and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight lining of rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
property costs related to the redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest incurred or imputed on redevelopment and construction projects are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
macerich financial statements maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc
