the transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe our policy on valuing inventory  including market value adjustments  is our primary critical accounting policy 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out method  or market 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department including finished goods that have been shipped to customers for evaluation 
market value adjustments are recorded for obsolete material  slow moving product  service and demonstration products 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventory based upon current market conditions 
these conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  customer demand and other factors 
if the market for our previously released products changes  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and enterprise goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant judgment is used in assessing factors which might trigger impairment including significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our net sales of million in decreased by  or less than one half percent from our lack of sales growth was attributable to lower volumes particularly in the us as a result of the economic slowdown 
sales were lower in the latter half of as the effect of the economic slowdown and the impact of the events of september was felt 
sales of certain of our analog and digital mixer families declined when compared to while digital recorder sales and loudspeaker sales have increased 
in addition  while net sales for included a full year of eaw sales versus nine months in  sales in the installed sound market traditionally served by eaw branded products have declined 
sales in the us accounted for of our sales in and of our sales in sales of our international subsidiaries are primarily made in currencies fixed to the euro 
the change in the euro against the us dollar caused these sales to be recorded at approximately million lower than these sales would have been if using the exchange rate 
additionally  our implementation of a fully integrated worldwide enterprise resource planning information system in temporarily impaired our ability to ship product from italy in the fourth quarter of and contributed to the decrease in net sales 
we expect to show growth in sales in the coming year and anticipate that a significant portion of sales will come from new products which have been or will be introduced in if the new products are not introduced in a timely manner or are not well received by the market  sales from these new products may not be realized 
gross profit gross profit was million or of net sales for compared to million or of net sales for this decline was primarily due to a shift in product mix from higher margin compact mixer and digital products to lower margin speaker products along with a general increase in material and labor costs across multiple product lines 
gross margin was also reduced by increased freight accommodations and sales discounts 
in  we began to transition the manufacture of certain of our product lines to offshore facilities and will continue this transfer in additionally  we expect to achieve improved production efficiencies in our us and italian manufacturing operations 
as a result of these improvements  we expect to see reductions of cost of sales and increases in gross profit in however  if these efficiencies are not realized  we may not achieve the expected improvement in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in the inclusion of the fixed component of eaw expenses for a full twelve months of versus nine months of resulted in an increase of approximately million 
in addition  costs associated with the implementation of our erp system contributed to this increase  as did increases in personnel early in the year 
in the latter half of the year  steps were taken to reduce expenses including closing the amsterdam office  reducing headcount  reducing salaries and initiating other cost cutting programs 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in the increase both in absolute dollars and percent is related to additional spending for new products and maintaining investment in ongoing product development 
the inclusion of eaw research and developments costs for twelve months of as compared to nine months in resulted in an increase of  additionally  our acquisition of sydec in april resulted in an increase of million of research and development expense 
other income expense net other expense was million for compared to net other expense of million for interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to borrowings related to the acquisition of eaw and to higher levels of short term borrowing under our bank credit facility 
other expense  comprised primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses  was million in compared with  in this increase was primarily due to the foreign exchange losses in as a result of the weakening of the italian lire against the us dollar 
provision benefit for income taxes we had a benefit for income taxes of million in compared to income tax expense of million in this represents an overall effective tax rate in of which includes taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we did not get the full tax rate benefit relating to our loss before benefit for income taxes in due to the non deductibility of certain amortization costs  and the rate and method of determination of taxation on non us subsidiaries 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million in from million in million of the increase was attributable to the addition of eaw 
we also saw significant revenue contribution worldwide from products introduced in and in the product categories of powered and cfx mixers  speakers  and digital products of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect of million and by declines in sales of m series amps and sr series live music application mixers of approximately million 
sales outside the us decreased to of our total net sales in from in this decrease was due mainly to the inclusion of sales by eaw whose sales outside of the us comprised only of its total net sales for gross profit gross profit was million in compared with million in of the million increase  million was attributable to the addition of eaw 
gross profit was also up as a result of the new products introduced during and as noted above 
the increase was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange effect on gross profit of approximately million 
gross profit percentage stayed constant at in and selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in of the million increase  million was attributable to the addition of eaw  million of which represents amortization charges on intangible assets 
higher sales volumes causing corresponding increases in variable expenses  such as commissions  along with incremental costs associated with an increased headcount also contributed to the increase 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by a million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the decline in the percentage is primarily attributable to higher sales 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eaw s research and development expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses stayed constant at in and other income expense other expense was million for compared to million in interest income decreased to  in compared with  in interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to borrowings related to the acquisition of eaw and to significantly higher levels of short term borrowing 
other expense for was million compared with million in this increase was primarily due to the foreign exchange losses in as a result of the weakening of the italian lire against the us dollar 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million representing an overall effective tax rate of compared to million and for the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in in  cash used by operations was million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to decreases in inventory and accounts receivable offset partially by a net loss  deferred taxes  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in income taxes payable 
the downward trend in inventory is due to the continued efforts to reduce our inventory levels 
net cash used by operating activities in was primarily attributable to increases in inventories  accounts receivable and a decline in income taxes payable offset partially by net income  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the large increase in inventories for over is attributable to higher levels of required inventory resulting from the expansion of product lines  certain product release delays and anticipated sales volume increases that did not materialize 
cash used in investing activities was million for million was used for the acquisition of sydec and million for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
the property  plant and equipment acquisitions in relate primarily to the costs of hardware and software associated with the worldwide implementation of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning information system and improvements to our computer and communications infrastructure 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in from million in  due principally to the acquisition of eaw  net of cash acquired of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities during was million due to net payments on long term and short term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to million in from million in  due principally to proceeds from bank credit facilities used for the acquisition of eaw of million and net proceeds on bank line of credit and other short term borrowings of million 
these inflows were partially offset by repayments of long term debt related to the mackie italy acquisition  eaw long term debt and italian based long term debt totaling million 
at december   we had a bank line of credit in the us that provided up to million of short term borrowing subject to certain limitations 
additionally  the line of credit provided a million guarantee on our debt in italy 
this guarantee reduced the maximum allowable borrowing to million as of december  at december  and  there was million and million outstanding on the line of credit  respectively 
at december  the available line was million 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus a specified margin 
in april  we entered into an agreement to revise the terms of both our bank line of credit and the term loan described below  which will result in the bank line of credit and the borrowings under the line increasing by approximately million and an equal reduction of million to the term loan 
the result is a bank line of credit that provides up to million of short term borrowing subject to certain limitations 
under the terms of our us credit agreement  we must maintain certain financial ratios and tangible net worth 
the agreement also provides  among other matters  restrictions on additional financing  dividends  mergers  acquisitions  and an annual capital expenditure limit 
at december   we were out of compliance with one of our financial covenants 
we were also out of compliance earlier during but negotiated a restructuring of the covenants and received a waiver from the lender 
this restructuring resulted in slightly higher interest rates in addition to certain loan amendment fees 
in april we received a waiver for the december  non compliance and negotiated a new credit agreement  including a restructuring of the covenants 
under the new credit agreement  the renewal date for the line of credit is april  the renewal date for the term loan is september both the line of credit and the term loan are secured by all us based assets including  but not limited to  accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets  intangibles and patents 
as a result of restructuring the line of credit and term loan  we have reclassified amounts related to the term loan previously shown as long term debt callable under covenant provisions in interim condensed consolidated financial statements 
we have taken various actions to improve results of operations and ensure our ongoing ability to cover scheduled debt servicing payments  including headcount reductions and other cost containment measures 
during the third and fourth quarters of  these measures included layoffs  salary reductions  office closures and reduction of capital expenditures 
we will continue to focus on increased management controls over expenditures and attempt to reduce costs of sales by improving our methods of product sourcing 
finally  we are evaluating a variety of alternative financing sources  including possible divestiture of certain operating assets 
additionally  we have entered into agreements with several banks in italy that provide short term credit facilities totaling approximately million 
the amount available to us is limited by the amount of our italian accounts receivable and was approximately million at december  at december  and there was approximately million and million  respectively outstanding under these facilities 
the majority of these credit facilities are secured by receivables of mackie italy 
interest rates on these credit facilities range from to 
the term loan may become callable under covenant provisions if we do not meet our new covenants 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that we will be able to meet our financial covenants in under the revised credit agreement 
we believe that our existing cash and credit facilities  along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital to fund operations over the next twelve months 
we had the following contractual commitments and obligations at december  operating leases short term and long term debt total in thousands new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supercede accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet one of two criteria  as defined in the statement 
this statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment 
separable intangible assets with defined lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the provisions of fas no 
will apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired before and after the statement s effective date 
as permitted by fas no 
 we plan to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of the provisions of fas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the provisions of fas apply to all entities that incur obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and will become effective for mackie commencing in this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
fas no 
retains many of the fundamental provisions of fas no 
and provides a single method of accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of fas no 
for the year beginning january  the adoption of the statement for long lived assets held for use is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential future effects that the adoption of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal will have on our financial statements 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures  however we did not have any material derivative financial instruments as of december  at december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million provided by us and italian banks 
as such  changes in us and european interest rates affect interest paid on debt and we are exposed to interest rate risk 
an increase in the average interest rate of would result in an approximately  increase to the loss before benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  a similar increase for the year ended december  would not have had a material effect on our earnings for that year 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at december  our non us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the non us dollar  and are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
additionally  a portion of sales from our us entities is denominated in other than the us dollar 
a increase in the value of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of increasing the loss before benefit for income taxes by approximately  a increase in the value of he us dollar in the year ended december   would have had the effect of reducing net income by approximately  impact of european monetary conversion european business systems were required to handle currencies in a new way with the introduction of the euro 
implementation procedures related to our enterprise resource planning information system began during the third quarter of and were substantially complete as of december  this system is euro compliant and was implemented in italy during the fourth quarter of to date  we have not experienced any problems with the conversion to the euro based accounting system and do not expect this transition or the use of the euro for transactions to materially affect our business 
if we encounter unexpected difficulties  our business could be harmed
