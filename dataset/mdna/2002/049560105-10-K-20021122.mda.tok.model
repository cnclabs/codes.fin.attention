ratemaking activity the following is a discussion of our ratemaking activity for rate cases that are currently pending as of september  or rate proceedings completed during the three years ended september  results of our rate activity for the three years ended september  can be summarized as follows no rate increases implemented in  net annual rate increases totaling million implemented in and net annual rate increase totaling million in in august  the texas division filed rate cases in its west texas system cities and amarillo  texas  requesting rate increases of approximately million and million 
the texas division received an increase in annual revenues of approximately million in base rates plus an increase of million in service charges in amarillo  texas  effective for bills rendered on or after january  the agreement with amarillo also provided for changes in the rate structure to reduce the impact of warmer than normal weather and to improve the recovery of the actual cost of service calls 
the texas division s request for an annual increase of approximately million from the cities served by its west texas system was denied 
in march  this decision was appealed to the railroad commission of texas 
subsequently  cities representing approximately percent of the texas division s customers ratified a non binding settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement capped the rate increase at million and entitled the ratifying cities to accept a rate increase below million in the event the railroad commission adopted a lesser increase for the non ratifying cities 
eight cities declined to participate in the settlement and a hearing with the railroad commission was held in august in december  the railroad commission approved an increase in annual revenues of approximately million that covered all cities served by the west texas system effective december  in addition  the railroad commission approved a new rate design providing more protection from warmer than normal weather for our west texas system 
in june  the trans la operations of the louisiana division were involved in a rate investigation before the louisiana public service commission  including the redesign of rates to mitigate the effects of warm winter weather 
a decision was rendered by the louisiana commission in october that increased service charges associated with customer service calls and increased the monthly customer charges from to  both effective november  while these changes are revenue neutral  they have mitigated the impact of warmer than normal winter weather on earnings 
the decision also included a three year rate stabilization clause which will allow the trans la operations of our louisiana division s rates to be adjusted annually to allow us to earn a return on equity within certain ranges that will be monitored on an annual basis 
in connection with its review of our acquisition of louisiana gas service  the louisiana public service commission approved a rate structure that requires us to share cost savings that resulted from the acquisition with the customers of louisiana gas service 
the shared cost savings will be the difference between operation and maintenance expense in any future year and the normalized expense for louisiana gas service  indexed for inflation  annual changes in labor costs and customer growth 
beginning january   the customers are assured annual savings  which will be indexed for inflation  annual changes in labor costs and customer growth 
the sharing mechanism will remain in place for years subject to established modification procedures 
in january and february  our louisiana division submitted its rate stabilization filings to the louisiana public service commission for the two gas systems we operate in louisiana 
recently completed audits by the louisiana public service commission of these filings found our earnings to be deficient and that rate adjustments were appropriate 
approved tariff revisions  which became effective november   will result in million in additional revenue per year during the first month period 
subsequent to the first month period  adjusted rates will provide million in total annual revenue increases 
as a result of the actions taken by the louisiana public service commission  atmos energy has decreased its overall weather sensitivity in louisiana 
in october  atmos received written notification from the executive secretary of the louisiana public service commission that he was asserting that a monthly facilities fee of approximately million charged since july to atmos by trans louisiana gas pipeline  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of atmos  pursuant to a contract between the parties  was excessive 
the executive secretary asserted that all monthly facilities fees in excess of approximately million from july should be refunded to ratepayers with interest 
atmos has responded to the secretary and noted that it has previously made all required filings with the commission fully disclosing the amount of the facilities fee 
atmos intends to file another petition seeking commission approval of the facilities fee by the end of calendar year similar to that filed in but containing updated data 
in the interim  atmos is continuing to charge a facilities fee of approximately million per month  as the executive secretary s correspondence does not constitute action of the commission 
in may  the kentucky division requested from the kentucky public service commission an increase in revenues  a weather normalization adjustment and changes in rate design to shift a portion of revenues from commodity charges to fixed rates 
in december  the kentucky commission granted an increase in annual revenues of approximately million 
the new rates were effective for services rendered on or after december  in addition  the kentucky commission approved a five year pilot program for weather normalization beginning in november on march   the kentucky commission issued an order approving a four year extension  effective april   of the performance based ratemaking mechanism related to gas procurement and gas transportation activities filed by the kentucky division 
the performance based ratemaking mechanism is incorporated into the kentucky division s gas cost adjustment clause 
as discussed above  it provides for sharing of purchased gas cost savings between our customers and us 
we recognized other income of million  million and million under the kentucky performance based ratemaking mechanism in fiscal years  and in november  the colorado kansas division filed a rate case with the colorado public utilities commission for approximately million in additional annual revenues 
in may  we received an increase in annual revenues of approximately million from the colorado public utilities commission 
the new rates went into effect on may  effective april   the tennessee regulatory authority approved the mid states division s request to continue its performance based ratemaking mechanism related to gas procurement and gas transportation activities 
the tennessee regulatory authority revised the mechanism from the original two year experimental period  by increasing the cap for incentive gains and or losses to million per year 
under this agreement  the mechanism has no expiration date and can be amended or cancelled by either the mid states division or the tennessee regulatory authority according to the provisions of the agreement 
similar to tennessee  the georgia public service commission renewed our performance based ratemaking program for an additional three years effective may  the gas purchase and capacity release mechanisms of the performance based ratemaking mechanism are designed to provide us incentives to find innovative methods to lower gas costs to our customers 
we recognized other income of million  million and million in fiscal years  and attributable to the georgia and tennessee performance based ratemaking mechanisms 
in february  the mid states division filed a rate case in illinois with the illinois commerce commission requesting an increase in annual revenues of approximately million 
after review by the illinois commerce commission  the amount requested was revised to approximately million 
the mid states division received an increase in annual revenues of approximately million 
the new rates went into effect on october  and are collected primarily through an increase in monthly customer charges 
in march  the mid states division filed a rate case in virginia with the state corporation commission of the commonwealth of virginia requesting an increase in annual revenues of approximately million 
the state corporation commission of virginia reviewed the filing to determine if it met the appropriate rules and regulations 
in july  we refiled the case requesting an increase in revenues of approximately million 
the commission accepted the revised filing 
in april  the mid states division agreed to an annual rate reduction of million effective beginning with the april billing cycle 
in march  the mid states division and the iowa consumer advocate division of the department of justice reached an agreement for an annual rate reduction of million relating to our iowa operations 
the rate reduction was effective in march in  the mid states division filed requests for accounting orders related to uncollectable delinquencies in three states 
as a result  we were able to defer million as a regulatory asset 
we continue to monitor rates in all of our service areas to ensure that they are adequate for the recovery of service costs and return on investment 
weather and seasonality our natural gas utility distribution business and irrigation sales business is seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in our service areas 
natural gas sales to residential  commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 
sales to agricultural customers  who typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september  are affected by rainfall amounts 
the effects of colder than normal winter weather in and the effects of warmer than normal winter weather in and on our consolidated volumes delivered are illustrated by the following degree day information 
the degree day information presented below for and is adjusted for service areas with weather normalized operations 
the degree day information for has not been adjusted for service areas with weather normalized operations as that information was not available 
year ended september sales volumes bcf transportation volumes bcf total degree days actual    percent of normal the effects of temperatures that are above or below normal are partially offset in the tennessee and georgia jurisdictions served by the mid states division and in the kentucky jurisdiction served by the kentucky division through weather normalization adjustments 
the georgia public service commission  the tennessee regulatory authority and the kentucky public service commission have approved weather normalization adjustments 
the weather normalization adjustments  effective october through may each year in georgia  and november through april each year in tennessee and kentucky  allow the mid states division and the kentucky division to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 
the net effect of the weather normalization adjustments was an increase in revenue of million in  a decrease in revenues of million for and an increase in revenues of million in approximately  or percent of our meters in service are located in georgia  tennessee and kentucky 
we did not have weather normalization adjustments in our other service areas during the year ended september  we also received approval to change our rate structure in our west texas system of the texas division beginning in december to help offset some of the negative effects of weather 
in july  we entered into an agreement to purchase weather hedges for our texas and louisiana operations effective for the heating season 
the hedges were designed to help mitigate the effects of weather that was at least seven percent warmer than normal in both texas and louisiana while preserving any upside 
the cost of the weather hedges was approximately million which was amortized over the heating season 
no income was recognized for the heating season for these weather hedges due to the colder than normal weather 
the cost of the weather hedges was more than offset by the positive effects of colder weather on our gross profit 
in june  we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an option to cancel in the third year 
we will receive a refund of a portion of the cost of the policy if we cancel in the third year 
the policy is for our texas and louisiana operations and covers the entire heating season of october to march beginning with the heating season 
the cost of the three year policy was million which was prepaid and is being amortized over the appropriate heating seasons based on degree days 
the insurance is designed to protect against weather that is at least seven percent warmer than normal for the entire heating season 
during the heating season  weather was not at least seven percent warmer than normal resulting in no claim having been filed under the insurance policy 
only the amortization of million of premiums was recognized during the heating season 
we have historically hedged approximately to percent of our gas supply through the use of our underground storage assets 
for the heating season  we covered approximately percent of our flowing gas requirements through storage  financial hedges and fixed forward contracts at a weighted average cost of slightly less than per mcf 
for the heating season  we have covered between and percent of our anticipated flowing gas requirements through storage  financial hedges and fixed forward contracts at a weighted average cost of less than per mcf 
this should provide protection to us and our customers against potential sharp increases in the price of natural gas during the heating season 
status of pending acquisition in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mississippi valley gas company  a privately held natural gas utility  for million  consisting of million cash and million of atmos common stock 
in addition  we will repay outstanding long term debt of mississippi valley gas of approximately million 
mississippi valley gas provides natural gas distribution service to approximately  residential  commercial  industrial and other customers located primarily in the northern and central regions of mississippi 
on october   we announced that we had received approval from the mississippi public service commission to acquire mississippi valley gas 
the transaction had previously received federal regulatory approval and approvals from the six other state utility commissions that require approval 
we expect to close the acquisition in december critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and pension and other post retirement plans 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions 
regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
as a result  certain costs are permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates 
risk management and trading activities we use storage  transportation and requirements contracts  forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options  futures and swap contracts to conduct our risk management and trading activities 
changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activity result primarily from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  maturity and settlement of contracts  and newly originated transactions 
the market prices and models used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimates considering various factors including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  the time value of money and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
we adjust the values to reflect the potential impact of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
changes in market prices directly affect management s estimate of the fair value of these transactions 
assumptions different from those used would impact these carrying values 
allowance for doubtful accounts for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an aging of those receivable balances 
we apply percentages to each aging category based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
goodwill at september   we had million of goodwill  million of which was attributable to our utility segment  million was attributable to our natural gas marketing segment and million was attributable to our other non utility segment 
we evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment each year during our second fiscal quarter 
our evaluation during the quarter ended march  resulted in no impairment 
if our projections of estimated future cash flows change  those changes could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
capital resources and liquidity see consolidated statements of cash flows fiscal was a year in which total cash inflows exceeded total cash outflows 
this was generally the result of increased cash flows from operating activities as a result of the louisiana gas service assets acquired in july  the acquisition of the remaining percent of woodward marketing that we did not already own in april and a decrease in cash held in margin accounts partially offset by increased capital expenditures 
common stock issued primarily through our retirement savings plan and our direct stock purchase plan was also used to finance operations 
cash flows from operating activities items on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended september  reflect changes in balances for the year  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the additional interest in woodward marketing  llc and the assets of louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from operating activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows totaled million for compared to million for and million for the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily the result of increases in net income  accounts payable and other current liabilities and decreases in cash held on deposit in margin accounts and deferred gas costs 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
the increase in net income was due primarily to higher gross profit and income from our gas marketing activities partially offset by higher operating expenses and interest expense 
cash flows from investing activities during the last three years  a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions  our ongoing construction program to provide natural gas services to our customer base and technology improvements 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in compared with million in and million in capital expenditures in fiscal amounted to million  compared with million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures from to was primarily the result of additional capital requirements needed due to our growing customer base 
included in investing activities for is million  in our natural gas marketing and other non utility operations  for the acquisition of kentucky based market area storage and associated pipeline facility assets  certain gas marketing assets and the common stock of southern resources  inc included in investing activities for is million used to acquire the assets of louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in investing activities in was million used to acquire the missouri natural gas distribution assets of associated natural gas 
currently budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal total approximately million and include funds for additional mains  services  meters and equipment 
in  we also plan to complete the mississippi valley gas company acquisition for million plus the repayment of approximately million of outstanding long term debt as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures and acquisitions for fiscal are planned to be financed from internally generated funds and financing activities as discussed below 
in  we had million in expenditures for assets to be used in leasing activities 
in  we had million in expenditures for assets to be used in leasing activities 
in connection with our acquisition of woodward marketing in  we received million in cash 
in  we received net proceeds of million in connection with the sale of certain utility assets 
in  we received net proceeds of million in connection with the sale of certain propane assets to heritage propane partners  lp cash flows from financing activities net cash used by financing activities totaled million for compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million for and million for financing activities during these periods included issuance of common stock  dividend payments  short term borrowings from banks under our credit facilities and issuance and repayment of long term debt 
the change in cash used by financing activities in as compared to cash provided by financing activities in was due primarily to the issuance of long term debt and the issuance of common stock during in  we received million in net proceeds from our million debt offering in may the net proceeds were used to help finance the completion of the louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company acquisition in july long term debt repayments totaled million  million and million for  and repayments of long term debt in  and consisted of annual installments under the various loan documents 
during  short term debt decreased by million due primarily to more effective collection experience of customer accounts receivable balances which increased the amount of cash available to reduce short term debt 
during  short term debt decreased million due primarily to the use of the net proceeds from our equity offering in december to reduce commercial paper debt 
during  short term debt increased million due to the effect of warmer weather on net income for  the acquisition of the missouri natural gas distribution assets of associated natural gas for million and increases in accounts receivable  cost of gas stored underground and deferred charges 
issuance of common stock 
we issued   and  shares of common stock in  and under our various plans 
see the consolidated statements of shareholders equity and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the number of shares issued and available for issuance under each of our plans 
in addition to the shares issued under our various plans  we also issued  shares through our equity offering in december and  shares of restricted common stock for the acquisition of the remaining percent of woodward marketing in april the net proceeds from the equity offering were used to reduce commercial paper debt as discussed above 
cash dividends paid 
we paid million in cash dividends during compared with million in and million in we increased the dividend per share by 
in both and and 
in the increase in cash dividends in over was also due to the increase in the number of shares outstanding as discussed above 
liquidity the excess of cash inflows over outflows has resulted in a slight decrease in debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  as shown in the table below 
september in thousands  except percentages short term debt   long term debt   shareholders equity   total capitalization  including short term debt   total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and our long term plans are to decrease the debt to capitalization ratio to nearer its target range of percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan  access to the debt and equity capital markets and limiting annual maintenance and capital expenditures 
it is likely that the debt to capitalization ratio will remain in its current range in the near term 
at september   we had short term committed credit facilities totaling million 
one short term unsecured credit facility is for million and serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard and poor s  p by moody s and f by fitch 
at september   million of commercial paper was outstanding 
we have a second credit facility in place for million 
at september   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
these credit facilities are negotiated at least annually and are used for working capital purposes 
on october   we entered into a million short term unsecured committed credit facility 
this credit facility will be used to provide initial funding for the cash portion of the mississippi valley gas acquisition and to refinance mississippi valley gas existing debt 
at september   our woodward marketing subsidiary had an uncommitted demand credit facility for million which is used for working capital purposes for our non utility business 
atmos energy holdings  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the sole guarantor of all amounts outstanding under this facility 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
related letters of credit totaling million reduced the amount available under this facility 
the amount available under this credit facility is also limited by various covenants  including covenants based on working capital 
under the most restrictive covenant  the amount available to woodward marketing under this credit facility at september  was million 
at september   we also had an unsecured short term uncommitted credit line for million 
there were no borrowings under this uncommitted credit facility at september  this uncommitted line is renewed or renegotiated at least annually with varying terms and we pay no fee for the availability of the line 
borrowings under this line are made on a when and as available basis at the discretion of the bank 
in addition  woodward marketing has up to million available from atmos energy holdings for its non utility business 
at september   million was outstanding 
any outstanding amounts under the atmos energy holdings facility are subordinated to woodward marketing s million uncommitted demand credit facility described above 
this intercompany loan is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the loan agreements pursuant to which our senior notes and first mortgage bonds have been issued contain covenants by us with respect to the maintenance of certain debt to equity ratios and cash flows and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these covenants 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to issue  from time to time  up to million in new common stock and or debt 
in connection with this filing  we filed applications for approval to issue securities with five state utility commissions and have received approval from all five commissions 
the registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on january  the proceeds from any issuance of securities under the registration statement are planned to be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  debt repayment and other business related matters

see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our risk management activities 
the following table shows our risk management assets and liabilities by segment at september  natural gas utility marketing total in thousands assets from risk management activities  current    assets from risk management activities  noncurrent   liabilities from risk management activities  current   liabilities from risk management activities  noncurrent   net assets liabilities    in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  current period changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities related to our utility segment are recorded as deferred gas cost on the consolidated balance sheet as these costs will ultimately be recovered from ratepayers 
accordingly  there is no earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments 
upon maturity  the contracts are recognized in purchased gas cost on the consolidated statement of income 
to conduct our risk management and trading activities  atmos energy marketing uses natural gas storage  transportation and requirements contracts  forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options  futures and swap contracts 
prior to may  atmos energy marketing engaged in limited financial trading for speculative purposes 
effective in may  atmos energy marketing s financial trading for speculative purposes was discontinued 
the mark to market method is used to account for these activities  as prescribed in eitf issue no 
 eitf issue and eitf issue under this method  the aforementioned contracts are reflected at fair value  inclusive of future servicing costs and valuation adjustments  with resulting unrealized gains and losses recorded as assets from risk management activities and liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheet 
current period changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized as net gains or losses on the consolidated statement of income as gas trading margin 
changes in assets and liabilities from risk management activities result primarily from changes in valuation of the portfolio of contracts  maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions 
market prices are primarily used to value these transactions 
in addition  a market price based model is used for valuing certain storage and transportation contracts 
these values reflect management s best estimate considering various factors  including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value  and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
the values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable time frame under present market conditions 
changes in market prices directly affect management s estimate of the fair value of these transactions 
at its october meeting  the emerging issues task force rescinded eitf issue nos 
and the impact on atmos will be to discontinue mark to market accounting of our sales  storage and transportation contracts and our natural gas storage inventory 
any cumulative effect of this change in accounting will depend on the number and valuation of our sales  storage and transportation contracts and our natural gas storage inventory level and valuation at the time we adopt the new rules 
the following table reflects the components of the change in fair value of our non utility energy trading contract activities for the year ended september  in thousands

the total volume of gas sold  excluding the louisiana gas service volumes  for was bcf compared with bcf for however  the decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by the additional sales volumes of bcf attributable to the louisiana gas service operations acquired in july the average cost of gas per mcf sold decreased percent to for from for however  the decrease in operating revenues was partially offset by increased revenues resulting from the louisiana gas service acquisition in july gross profit increased by five percent to million for from million for the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the additional gross profit resulting from the louisiana gas service acquisition in july partially offset by the effect of warmer weather 
changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer 
in april  we completed our acquisition of the remaining percent interest in woodward marketing  llc that we did not already own 
as a result of this acquisition  the revenues and expenses of woodward marketing are now shown on a consolidated basis 
for  atmos energy marketing  which includes the operations of woodward marketing and trans louisiana industrial gas company  had income of million in gas trading margin 
for  atmos energy marketing had income of million in gas trading margin and an equity in earnings of woodward marketing of million 
the increase for compared to was primarily due to gains on inventory sales and favorable pricing under natural gas sales contracts as well as our full consolidation of woodward marketing beginning april operating expenses increased to million for from million for operation and maintenance expense increased due primarily to the addition of million relating to the louisiana gas service acquisition in july and an increase of million in pension costs 
in addition  operation and maintenance expense increased million due to the full consolidation of woodward marketing s operations beginning april  a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of million partially offset this increase 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts was attributable to the lower gas commodity prices during as well as our effective recovery of customer receivable balances 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to the addition of the assets from the louisiana gas service acquisition in july taxes other than income decreased as a result of decreased city franchise taxes and state gross receipts taxes  which are revenue based 
however  these taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
the decrease in taxes other than income was partially offset by increases in property and payroll taxes related to the louisiana gas service acquisition in july operating income increased percent for to million from million for the increase in operating income resulted primarily from the increase in gross profit and the income from our gas trading margin described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
miscellaneous expense decreased million to million in compared to million in this decrease was due primarily to an increase in net recoveries related to our performance based ratemaking mechanisms  the recognition of million related to a large industrial contract we received during and a reduction in the amortization expense recognized related to weather insurance purchased for the heating season 
in addition  we had an increase of million in interest income in may due primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from our million debt offering in we invested these proceeds in short term investments until the completion of the louisiana gas service acquisition in july no such interest income was recognized in interest expense increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was due primarily to the interest expense on the million debt offering in may net income increased for by million to million from million for this increase in net income resulted primarily from the increase in operating income partially offset by the increase in interest expense discussed above 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating revenues increased by percent to billion for from million for the most significant factors contributing to the increase in operating revenues were a percent increase in average sales price due to the increased cost of gas and a percent increase in sales and transportation volumes due to colder weather 
during  excluding service areas with weather normalized operations  temperatures were percent colder than in the corresponding period of the prior year and were seven percent colder than the year normal 
the total volume of gas sold and transported for was bcf compared with bcf for during the early part of our fiscal year  natural gas prices throughout the country began to increase significantly 
the average cost of gas per mcf sold increased to for from for although we expect to recover our purchased gas costs from customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms  generally there is a lag between the time we pay for gas purchases and the time when regulators allow us to place higher rates in service and recover those gas costs 
as a result  we have from time to time used short term borrowings to temporarily finance unrecovered purchased gas costs 
where permitted  we have increased our purchased gas adjustments to help mitigate the increased cost of gas 
in addition  as a result of the increased gas costs  our accounts receivable balances during fiscal increased significantly and  consequently  we also increased our allowance for doubtful accounts  which we considered to be adequate 
we do not  however  expect this rise in natural gas prices to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or net cash flows 
in addition  operating revenues increased due to the impact of rate increases in kentucky  illinois  colorado  amarillo  texas  and west texas 
also contributing to the increase in operating revenues was the addition of approximately  customers in missouri due to the associated natural gas acquisition completed in fiscal and the addition of approximately  residential and commercial meters in louisiana due to the completion of the louisiana gas service company acquisition in july however  operating revenues were partially offset by a reduction related to our former propane assets which were placed into a joint venture partnership in august gross profit increased by percent to million for from million for the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in volumes sold to weather sensitive customers  an increase of million in transportation revenues due to higher average transportation revenue per mcf and increased volumes and a million non recurring adjustment to purchased gas cost to reflect state filings 
in addition  gross profit increased due to the impact of rate increases and additional customers  partially offset by a reduction related to our former propane operations 
changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers 
on april   we completed our acquisition of the remaining percent interest in woodward marketing  llc as a result of this acquisition  the revenues and expenses of woodward marketing are now shown on a consolidated basis 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for operation and maintenance expense decreased due to savings resulting from the continued cost control initiatives started during fiscal and reduced operation and maintenance expenses associated with our former propane operations which were placed into a joint venture partnership in fiscal an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of million and pension costs of million partially offset this decrease 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the completion of the louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company acquisition in july taxes other than income increased as a result of increased city franchise taxes and state gross receipts taxes  which are revenue based 
however  these taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
operating income increased percent for to million from million for the increase in operating income resulted primarily from increased gross profit described above 
equity in earnings of woodward marketing  llc was million for the six months ended march  compared with million for the year miscellaneous income expense decreased million to million for compared to million for this decrease was due primarily to charges incurred related to our performance based ratemaking mechanisms and the amortization of million related to weather hedges purchased for our louisiana and texas operations 
in addition  we recognized a gain of million in resulting from the sale of certain non utility assets 
no such gain occurred in partially offsetting the decrease in miscellaneous income expense during was an increase of million in interest income due primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from our million debt offering in may we invested these proceeds in short term investments until the completion of the louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company acquisition in july interest expense increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was due primarily to interest expense on the million debt offering in may net income increased for by million to million from million for this increase in net income resulted primarily from the increase in sales volumes due to the colder than normal weather and the impact of rate increases discussed above 
factors that may affect future performance of the company our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and natural gas marketing operations 
several factors exist that could influence atmos future financial performance  some of which are described below 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
adverse weather conditions our natural gas sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather 
our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our west texas irrigation market 
weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance 
however  as was more fully discussed above  we have purchased weather insurance to mitigate the effect of warmer than historically normal weather in our texas and louisiana service areas 
in addition  weather normalized rates are in effect in several of our jurisdictions  which should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our operating results 
national  regional and local economic conditions our operations will always be affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national  regional and local economies  including interest rates  changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity  natural gas 
these factors impact the amount of residential  industrial and commercial growth in our service territories 
higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 
regulatory approvals our utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the states in which we operate 
we monitor the allowed rates of return  our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed 
in addition  in the normal course of the regulatory environment  assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed 
once rate cases are filed  regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases 
because of this process  we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief  which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag 
in addition  our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in five states  which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable short term market conditions 
successful completion and integration of pending acquisition our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate the operations of companies such as mississippi valley gas company  which acquisition is currently expected to close in december acquisitions such as mississippi valley gas should help us achieve greater economies of scale by spreading the fixed costs of the utility business over a larger customer base 
in addition  the integration of this acquisition into our operations during the next fiscal year will require a substantial commitment of financial resources and management time 
inflation and increased gas costs we believe that inflation has caused  and will continue to cause  increases in certain operating expenses  and has required  and will continue to require  assets to be replaced at higher costs 
we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
historically  we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so 
the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 
in addition  the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas  as has occurred in some prior years  causes us to experience a significant increase in short term debt because we must pay suppliers for such gas when it is purchased long before such costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered 
also  increases in purchased gas costs cause more customers to be slow to pay their gas bills  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable which in turn lead to higher short term debt levels and increased bad debts 
should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in the upcoming heating season  we would expect increases in our short term debt and accounts receivable during fiscal increased competition we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies 
in the case of industrial customers  such as manufacturing plants  and agricultural customers  adverse economic conditions  including higher gas costs  could cause such customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or to bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per unit costs 
deregulation or unbundling we are closely monitoring the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry 
unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services 
because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures  we believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling evolves 
consequently  we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 
hedging and market risk activities utility hedging activities to protect against volatility in gas prices  we are hedging gas costs for the heating season by utilizing a combination of storage  financial hedges and fixed forward contracts to stabilize gas prices 
for the heating season  we have covered approximately to percent of our anticipated flowing gas requirements through storage and financial instruments 
the gas hedges should help to moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by potentially higher gas prices 
atmos energy marketing activities we acquired a percent interest in woodward marketing  llc in july as a result of the merger of atmos and united cities gas company  which had acquired that interest in may in april  we acquired the percent interest that we did not own from jd woodward and others for  restricted shares of our common stock 
immediately following the acquisition  mr 
woodward was elected as a senior vice president of atmos in charge of all non utility business activities  a position he has held since april prior to that time  mr 
woodward had not been an officer or employee of atmos 
the principal business of atmos energy marketing  including the activities of woodward marketing and trans louisiana industrial gas company  inc  is the overall management of natural gas requirements for municipalities  local gas utility companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
this business involves the sale of natural gas by atmos energy marketing to its customers and the management of storage and transportation contracts for its customers under contracts generally having one to two year terms 
at september   atmos energy marketing had municipal customers and industrial customers 
atmos energy marketing also sells natural gas to certain of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms from days to two years 
in addition  atmos energy marketing supplies our regulated operations with a portion of our natural gas requirements on a competitive bid basis 
any mark to market gains or losses on these affiliate contacts are eliminated 
in the management of natural gas requirements for municipal and other local utilities  atmos energy marketing sells physical natural gas for future delivery and manages the associated price risk through the use of gas futures  forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options  and swap contracts with counterparties 
these financial contracts are marked to market at the daily close of business 
atmos energy marketing links gas derivatives to physical delivery of natural gas and typically balances its derivatives positions at the end of each trading day 
over the counter swap agreements require atmos energy marketing to receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of natural gas on the settlement date 
atmos energy marketing uses these futures and swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas  which are also carried on a mark to market basis 
mark to market accounting refers to the measurement of contracts at fair value determined at the balance sheet date with any gains and losses included in earnings 
options held to manage price risk provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price

at any point in time  atmos energy marketing may not have completely offset its price risk on these activities 
energy related services provided by atmos energy marketing include the sale of natural gas to its various customer classes and management of transportation and storage assets and inventories 
more specifically  energy services include contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  storage acquisition  natural gas purchase and delivery and capacity utilization strategies 
in providing these services  atmos energy marketing generates income from its utility  municipal and industrial customers through negotiated prices based on the volume of gas supplied to the customer 
atmos energy marketing also generates income by taking advantage of the difference between near term gas prices and prices for future delivery as well as the daily movement of gas prices by utilizing storage and transportation capacity that it controls 
prior to may  atmos energy marketing engaged in limited financial trading for speculative purposes 
financial trading involves utilizing financial instruments futures  options  swaps  etc 
to hedge natural gas prices or to take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement

atmos energy marketing will continue its financial trading for hedging risk management purposes related to its physical trading positions 
with regard to its physical trading business  atmos energy marketing does engage in limited speculative natural gas trading for its own account primarily related to its storage activity  subject to a risk management policy established by us which limits the level of trading loss to a maximum of percent of the budgeted annual operating income of atmos energy holdings 
physical trading involves utilizing physical assets storage and transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement 
compliance with such risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis 
in addition  woodward marketing s bank credit facility limits trading positions that are not closed at the end of the day open positions to bcf of natural gas 
at september   atmos energy marketing s net open positions in its trading operations totaled bcf 
atmos energy marketing s open trading positions are monitored on a daily basis but are not required to be closed if they remain within the limits set by the bank loan agreement 
in addition to the price risk of any net open position at the end of each trading day  the financial exposure that results from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day 
financial instruments  which subject atmos energy marketing to counterparty risk  consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured 
counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial counterparties to a contract 
exchange traded future and option contracts are generally guaranteed by the exchanges 
atmos energy marketing s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry  and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 
from time to time  woodward marketing borrows money to fund its natural gas purchases and to fulfill its obligations to maintain deposit accounts with its counterparties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis does not  however  consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
gas prices utility segment we purchase natural gas for our operations 
substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
the utility segment has a limited market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot prices for sale to non regulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of such gas 
to protect against volatility in gas prices  we from time to time hedge our gas costs by purchasing futures contracts 
our utility segment does not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixed price non regulated sales 
based on projected fiscal non regulated gas sales at fixed prices  such an increase would result in an increase to cost of gas of approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing segment in april  we acquired the percent interest in woodward marketing  llc  that we did not already own

interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
if market interest rates for short term borrowings in fiscal had averaged two percent more  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
market risk for fixed rate long term obligations is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million based on discounted cash flow analyses 
as of september   we were not engaged in other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or market commodity prices
