item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with pall s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
the discussions under the subheadings review of market segment and geographies below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
as used below  indicates that we have rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one half percentage point 
acquisition and related matters on april   we acquired fsg for total cash consideration of million  subject to a post closing adjustment of the purchase price based on the net assets acquired as of april  the amount of the consideration was determined by our board of directors after review of the fsg business and its potential impact on our operations 
fsg is a pioneer and global leader in the design  manufacture and sale of filtration products for the separation and purification of liquids and gases 
fsg primarily serves the food beverage  fuels chemicals  machinery equipment and microelectronics markets as well as the biotech and pharmaceutical industries 
with a diversified portfolio of filter media  fsg provides end users with an array of filter elements  housings and systems with high technology and superior performance 
fsg complements our global franchise with outstanding branded products and technology  enabling us to provide the fullest range of integrated filtration products and services 
this acquisition also broadens our exposure to the growth and stability of the food and beverage sector and enhances our ability to better serve our customers 
the acquisition was initially funded with a day variable rate libor plus basis points credit facility 
on august   we issued million of year bonds at an annual interest rate of 
the proceeds were utilized to repay a portion of the interim acquisition credit facility 
the remainder of the acquisition credit facility was financed on october   with a million bank term loan at a rate based on libor plus basis points 
as a result of the additional borrowing to fund the acquisition  waivers of certain non financial covenants were obtained and the funded debt covenant of our existing senior revolving credit facility and private placement debt was amended 
additionally  as a result of the increased debt level  standard poors lowered our credit rating to single a minus from single a 
the expected annual increase in interest expense as a result of the revised credit rating approximates 
million 
fsg s balance sheet has been consolidated with our balance sheet as of august  and its earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal have been included in our consolidated operating results for the twelve months ended august  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the total cost of the acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
as such  the cost of the acquisition has been allocated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at august   with the exception of in process research and development and patented and unpatented technology  the valuations of these items have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to value them 
the finalization of these valuations will affect future earnings as in process research and development will be immediately charged to earnings and finite lived amortizable intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the august  consolidated balance sheet reflec ts the preliminary allocation of the purchase price and goodwill of million 
at the date of acquisition  management began formulating integration plans  which contemplate the closure of redundant facilities and the sale of certain businesses 
in addition  the synergies created by joining the two organizations have resulted in employee terminations 
the condensed consolidated balance sheet at august  reflects liabilities for such items  however  we will continue to finalize and announce other integration plans during fiscal the finalization of these integration plans concerning fsg s facilities and employees  as well as the technology valuations will be reported in future periods as increases and decreases to goodwill and to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the financial statement impact of integration plans that concern pall facilities and employees will be reflected in earnings 
for more detail regarding the fsg acquisition  please refer to the acquisitions note in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies 
purchase accounting the acquisition of fsg described above required us to use the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
as provided by sfas no 
 the company has one year following the acquisition to finalize estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
to assist in this process  the company obtained appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
as discussed above  valuations for all but the acquired technology are complete 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete them 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  management reserves an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
accrued expenses the company estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
the most material accrued estimates relate to environmental proceedings and insurance related expenses  including self insurance 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses 
workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed including applied loss development factors 
employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside the united states 
at august   the cumulative earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided are approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the united states  they would generate foreign tax credits that could reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend  however  a determination of any residual us tax on such repatriation is not practicable 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for fiscal were  million as compared with  million in fiscal exchange rates reduced reported sales for the year by million  or  primarily due to the weakness of the yen and to a lesser extent the argentine peso  partly offset by the strengthening of the euro 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed period over period  sales increased year over year 
pricing was flat as compared with fiscal fsg  which was acquired at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  contributed million to sales for the year 
excluding fsg  sales in local currency declined 
we were pleased with our top line performance in light of the difficult environment we have been operating in all year 
our full year sales reflected an approximate million reduction on a reported basis in microelectronics excluding the impact of fsg  the effect of pricing reductions for blood filters in the first three quarters fiscal  as well as the effect of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market and the malaise in the us industrial markets 
we have ended this fiscal year on an upbeat note and in the fourth quarter we achieved record sales with and without fsg 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to before a one time purchase accounting adjustment of million  discussed below from last year 
the increase in cost of sales reflects the reduced pricing related to multiple long term contracts with large blood center customers  most of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal  inventory write downs in asia  and the effect of a change in product mix 
additionally  the acquisition of fsg  which historically operated at lower gross margins than pall  had the effect of increasing cost of sales by 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to from in fiscal the year over year comparison of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was negatively impacted by a million property tax refund that reduced last year s expenses and by million in costs incurred in the current year to integrate fsg 
excluding these factors  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales would have increased  reflecting severance payments unrelated to acquisitions  and inflationary increases in certain costs such as salaries  pension expense and insurance 
fsg added million to selling  general and administrative expenses in the year 
we have identified million in annualized cost synergies of which we expect to realize million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a result of our integration of fsg and we are continuing to evaluate other potential cost savings 
in fiscal  we expect an increase in pension costs of approximately million in light of the current rates of return and discount rates 
in addition  we expect an increase in insurance premiums of approximately million 
we will continue efforts to hold down controllable costs to offset the impact of these increased costs 
research and development r d expenses declined to of sales from in fiscal  reflecting our efforts to hold down controllable costs 
fsg added million to r d expenses in the year 
the fourth quarter of fiscal included our final r d payment to vi technologies vitex as a result of the modification of our partnership agreement to eliminate shared research costs 
we have worked successfully with vitex on the development of pathogen reduced red blood cells and have brought this technology to pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
in fiscal  we incurred million in r d costs as a result of this agreement 
going forward  we will share in vitex s success through royalties on sales as well as stock ownership in the company  but will not have further responsibility for r d 
our products are assured access to the vitex platform wherever it is commercialized 
in t he coming months  we expect to fund a final million milestone payment for equity  provided vitex enrolls the first patient in the phase iii clinical trials on or before december  reference is also made to the other current and non current assets note in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal years and  we recorded restructuring  other charges and adjustments of million and million  respectively 
the fiscal charges reflect severance costs related to the fsg acquisition  a one time purchase accounting adjustment of million included in cost of sales  an addition of million to a previously established environmental remediation reserve and a million write down of two strategic investments 
the fiscal restructuring charge primarily related to a reduction in workforce as part of our continued cost control efforts 
the details of the fiscal and fiscal charges can be found in the restructuring and other charges note in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of each charge 
net interest expense for the year declined million compared with fiscal the reduction in interest expense reflects decreased interest rates  lower average debt levels during the first three quarters of fiscal compared with last year  and the benefits from a receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap that we entered into on our million private placement fixed rate debt at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the above positive benefits were partly offset by increased interest expense in the fourth quarter as a result of the interim borrowings to fund the acquisition of fsg 
the underlying effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with last year 
the increase in the underlying effective tax rate reflects a change in the geographic distribution of profits compared with last year 
we expect to sustain an underlying tax rate of in fiscal net earnings for the year were million  or cents per share  compared with net earnings of million  or cents per share last year 
excluding the restructuring and other charges  net  in each year  and giving effect to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
as discussed below  net earnings were million  or cents per share  and million  or per share  in fiscal and  respectively 
fsg contributed cent per share to fiscal earnings  which includes a cent cost of financing and purchase accounting amortization 
the majority of the decline in net earnings for the year relates to lower sales  principally in our microelectronics and aerospace segments  lower gross margins  principally related to reduced pricing for large blood bank customers and a change in product mix 
in addition  increased expenses that were related to the integration of fsg  severance costs non acquisition related and the benefit in the prior year of a property tax refund  negatively impacted earnings for the year 
additionally  it is estimated that earnings per share decreased approximately cents in the year  due to the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
we implemented sfas no 
 in the first quarter of fiscal the full year effect on fiscal would have been to increase earnings by million  after pro forma tax effect  or cents per share 
review of market segments and geographies the following table presents sales by market segment  including the effect of exchange rates change exchange rate difference change in local currency blood   biopharmaceuticals   total life sciences    general industrial    aerospace   microelectronics    total industrial    total    life sciences sales for the year grew compared with last year 
excluding fsg  sales increased 
life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal excluding fsg  life sciences would have comprised of total sales in the current year 
within life sciences  blood segment sales were flat compared with fiscal as a volume increase of was offset by a price decrease of 
the reduction in pricing primarily related to multiple long term supply agreements with large blood bank customers  the majority of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal blood sales were up in the fourth quarter compared with fiscal reflecting the blood filter volume growth experienced as a result of these long term contracts 
sales to blood centers continue to comprise approximately three quarters of our worldwide blood filter sales 
by geography  western hemisphere blood sales  which represent about two thirds of our worldwide blood sales  were essentially flat year over year as increased blood center sales were offset by declines in hospital and cardiovascular sales 
in europe  blood sales declined  as growth in hospital and cardiovascular sales were offset by declines in blood center sales 
blood sales in asia increased year over year  primarily due to strong growth in blood center sales in hong kong  korea and singapore 
biopharmaceutical sales grew compared with last year  reflecting growth in both our biosciences and pharmaceutical sub markets 
fsg accounted for of the biopharmaceutical growth year over year 
biosciences  which sells to the laboratory  hospital and oem markets  grew driven by strong hospital and laboratory sales 
hospital sales grew reflecting strong sales of our aquasafe products  while sales in the laboratory market grew reflecting strong sales in the molecular biology arena 
additionally  sales in our laboratory market have benefited from our innovative distribution agreement with vwr international  which allows our customers easy access to a full range of product and service needs 
laboratory sales also have been positively impacted by the launch of our first well plate products from our strategic alliance with qiagen 
by geography  biosciences sales growth was driven by sales in the western hemispher pe 
in asia  sales were up slightly 
the pharmaceutical sub market grew compared with fiscal reflecting robust sales in the biotechnology sector during the first half of the year 
all geographies contributed to this gain  however  pharmaceutical product sales were particularly strong in europe and asia 
our industrial business accounted for approximately of total sales this year excluding fsg and last year 
industrial sales grew compared with last year reflecting the acquisition of fsg  which contributed million in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales for our industrial business were down reflecting a sharp decline in microelectronics sales see the following discussion regarding microelectronics segment sales 
excluding microelectronics  as well as the impact of the fsg acquisition  sales for the balance of our industrial business increased 
general industrial segment sales  which are the largest portion of our industrial business  increased compared with last year fueled by fsg  which contributed million in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales were up  despite a backdrop of weakened us and european demand in the cyclical industrial end markets 
for the year  solid double digit growth was achieved in the power generation  food beverage and water processing product lines both with and without fsg  as these are generally non cyclical in nature 
the fuels chemicals sub market  which was one of the largest beneficiaries of fsg sales  grew and excluding fsg  posted low single digit growth 
sales in machinery equipment  the largest market within general industrial  declined year over year down  excluding fsg 
the machinery equipment market includes cyclical markets such as pulp paper  primary metals  machine tools and mobile equipment  as such  sales were negatively impacted by weakened demand throughout fiscal  principally in the us by geography  general industrial sales in asia were up up  excluding fsg reflecting good growth in fuels chemicals and food beverage partly offset by declines in water processing and power generation 
machinery equipment sales in asia were up slightly  but down excluding fsg 
sales in europe increased compared with last year  primarily due to the acquisition of fsg  which contributed million in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  general industrial sales in europe were up  as moderate growth in power generation  water processing and fuels chemicals were partly offset by declines in food beverage and machinery equipment 
in the western hemisphere  sales increased year over year attributable to the acquisition of fsg  which added million in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales were flat as strong growth in the non cyclical markets such as p ation  water processing and food beverage was offset by a decline in machinery equipment attributable to weakened demand in the us marketplace 
aerospace sales were flat compared with fiscal as strong growth in military sales up during the first half of the year was offset by an overall decline in the commercial side of the business of  which reflects the continued downturn in the commercial airline industry after the tragic events of september military sales comprised of total aerospace sales this year compared with last year 
we expect aerospace to grow in the low single digits in fiscal  with some upside potential when the commercial market recovers 
by geography  aerospace sales in europe were flat as strong military and commercial marine water sales were offset by a decline in the balance of the commercial business 
in the western hemisphere  where approximately of the commercial aerospace business is generated  sales were down  as declines in the commercial side of the business more than offset strong growth in military sales 
asia reported strong growth in both military and commercial aerospace sales  although the size of our aerospace business there is not as significant 
microelectronics sales declined compared with last year  which includes million in sales generated from fsg 
excluding fsg  sales declined approximately million or 
all geographies reported double digit declines in microelectronics sales year over year 
in dollars  the western hemisphere and asia were hit the hardest 
we are beginning to see signs of a recovery  and on a sequential quarter basis  sales were up from quarter three excluding fsg 
we continue to develop new products and are well positioned to benefit from the next up cycle 
additionally  our acquisition of fsg materially strengthens our position in this marketplace 
the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales for the year declined to from in fiscal in life sciences  overall operating profit declined to from last year reflecting the impact of reduced pricing related to multiple long term contracts with large blood center customers  the majority of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal the benefit of increased volume as a result of these contracts partly offset the negative impact of the reduced pricing 
within life sciences  blood operating profit for the year declined to from last year reflecting the price decreases mentioned previously 
operating profit in biopharmaceutical decreased to from last year  attributable to a change in product mix 
overall operating profit in industrial decreased to from last year  reflecting the effect of lower sales excluding the effects of the fsg acquisition coupled with a change in product mix 
general industrial operating profit declined to from last year  reflecting decreased machinery equipment sales and a change in product mix 
aerospace operating profit declined to from last year primarily due to decreased sales volume and a change in product mix 
reflecting the sales volume reduction  microelectronics operating profit was compared with operating profit of last year 
general corporate expenses increased million year over year reflecting the million property tax refund that reduced last year s expenses and million in costs incurred this year to integrate fsg  partly offset by our continued efforts to hold down controllable costs 
by geography  sales in the western hemisphere increased 
however  excluding the impact of fsg  sales declined 
exchange rates  primarily related to the weakening of the argentine peso  negatively impacted sales for the year by million 
operating profit declined to from last year 
the shortfalls in operating profit reflect the reduced pricing in the blood bank contracts mentioned above as well as the effects of lower industrial sales coupled with a change in the industrial product mix 
in europe  sales increased  excluding the impact of fsg  sales were up slightly 
the strengthening of european currencies added million in sales in the year  resulting in reported sales growth excluding fsg of 
operating profit declined to from last year reflecting lower sales volumes in several markets 
sales in asia increased  excluding the impact of fsg  sales were flat 
a weakening of the yen reduced sales by million in the year  resulting in a decline in sales on a reported basis of without fsg 
operating profit declined to from last year primarily due to the effects of the weakening yen  inventory write downs in the fourth quarter and the shortfall in microelectronics sales 
compared with review of consolidated results sales for fiscal were  million compared with  million in fiscal adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  particularly the euro and the yen  reduced sales by million or for the year 
in local currency  sales increased year over year 
pricing changes had an immaterial impact on sales 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to paragraphs below under review of market segments and geographies 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees 
accordingly  we reclassified freight costs incurred to deliver products to customers  which were historically included in selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
the amount of freight cost reclassified to cost of sales approximated million in each of the years ended july   and july  cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to from last year before restructuring and other charges  net  discussed below 
charges aggregating million for blood product inventories in europe and the western hemisphere and to update membrane filtration systems primarily in the biopharmaceutical market negatively impacted cost of sales year over year 
additionally  last year benefited from some high margin business and from an unfulfilled supply agreement  neither of which repeated this fiscal year 
fiscal cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  also reflects the negative impact of foreign exchange on sales  as well as the reduced pricing related to a new agreement reached with a major blood customer in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to from in fiscal the increase for the year reflects the loss on the sale of an investment of approximately million as well as the effect of exchange rates on the comparison of expenses to sales 
because approximately half of sg a expenses are incurred in the united states and about of sales occur in foreign locations  the negative impact of exchange rates on sales also negatively impacted the comparison of expenses to sales 
a million property tax refund in fiscal partially offset the above 
r d expenses increased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal due to the funding of the development of pathogen reduction technology with vitex 
in fiscal years and  we recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of million and million  respectively  as part of our continued efforts to control costs 
the details of the fiscal and fiscal charges can be found in the restructuring and other charges note in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of each charge 
net interest expense increased million compared with fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed a million private placement of fixed rate debt and closed a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility based on floating rate libor 
as a result of these transactions  uncommitted lines of credit amounting to million were cancelled 
the transactions resulted in more stability in borrowings at a higher interest cost  as the rates paid on the uncommitted lines of credit were lower than the rates paid on the private placement and senior revolving credit facility 
the impact of increased interest costs was partially offset by the decrease in our debt  net of cash and short term investments 
due to the continued movement of manufacturing to lower tax jurisdictions such as puerto rico and ireland  the geographic mix of our taxable income has reduced our underlying effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal net earnings were million  or cents per share in fiscal  compared with net earnings of million  or per share last year 
excluding the restructuring and other charges  net  in both years  net earnings amounted to million  or per share  and million  or per share  in fiscal and  respectively 
reported net earnings for fiscal and include charges equating to cents per share and cents per share after pro forma tax effect  respectively 
it is estimated that earnings per share in fiscal decreased about to cents due to the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
review of market segments and geographies the following table presents sales by market segment  including the effect of exchange rates change exchange rate difference change in local currency blood    biopharmaceuticals    total life sciences    general industrial    aerospace    microelectronics    total industrial    total    blood sales grew by in local currency year over year 
in fiscal  we continued to see the shift in sales from hospitals to blood centers 
reflecting this shift  local currency sales to hospitals declined compared with fiscal  while sales to blood centers increased 
globally  sales to blood centers represent of total fiscal blood sales  up from in cardiovascular sales increased in local currency  also contributing to the growth in the blood segment over the prior year 
total unit sales increased by approximately year over year 
the gap between the increase in blood filter dollar sales and unit sales reflects the continued shift away from higher priced systems to sterile dockable filters  a trend we began to see in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as the signing of a major long term supply agreement entered into with a large blood bank customer effective may  pursuant to the long term supply agreement  the customer is required to purchase a certain percentage of its annual requirements hereinafter the annual contract minimum percentage from us at set prices each year 
the customer is to receive an additional discount for purchases that exceed the annual contract minimum percentage and is to pay us a premium for amounts purchased that are below the annual contract minimum percentage 
by geography  strong growth in blood sales in the western hemisphere and moderate growth in asia were partially offset by decreased sales in europe  particularly the united kingdom  reflecting the strong market in the united states as well as a difficult comparison to last year as customers were stocking up in europe 
the western hemisphere represents about two thirds of the global blood business where the shift in blood filter sales from hospitals to blood centers was particularly evident as sales to hospitals declined while sales to blood centers increased 
biopharmaceutical sales grew in local currency reflecting increases in the pharmaceutical and biosciences sub markets of and  respectively 
sales grew well in all geographies with the exception of the western hemisphere  where sales declined compared with fiscal  primarily related to a reduction in sales to certain oem customers 
general industrial sales increased in local currency fueled by growth of  and in the water processing  fuels chemicals and machinery equipment sub markets  respectively 
the above increases were offset by a decline in the power generation sub market as fiscal reflected a large sale to a power plant in taiwan 
sales in the food beverage sub market were flat 
sales grew well in all geographies with the exception of the western hemisphere  where sales declined reflecting the impact of the slowing us economy in the industrial arena as well as the large sale to a power plant in fiscal  mentioned above 
aerospace experienced strong growth year over year  with local currency sales increasing 
the commercial and military sub markets experienced double digit increases of and  respectively  while marine sales grew by 
growth was strong in all geographies  led by asia  where local currency sales increased 
microelectronics was the powerhouse of our growth early this year and last year  however  sales in the fourth quarter declined due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry  resulting in overall growth for the year of 
the downturn in the microelectronics industry hit the hardest in the western hemisphere where sales declined in the fourth quarter resulting in a decline of for the year 
although both asia and europe experienced high double digit growth earlier in the year  sales in the fourth quarter declined and  resulting in overall growth for the year of and  respectively 
the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal declined to compared with for in life sciences  operating profit declined to from last year 
the reduced profit reflects start up costs of new medical manufacturing facilities in mexico and italy  the blood products inventory provisions  costs to upgrade certain membrane filtration systems in the biopharmaceutical market  increased r d for the development of pathogen reduction  reduced pricing related to a new agreement reached with major blood bank customers in the fourth quarter  reduced high margin sales in biosciences  as well as amounts recognized in fiscal from an unfulfilled supply agreement that did not repeat in fiscal within life sciences  blood operating profit for the year declined to from last year  reflecting the price decreases related to start up costs for new manufacturing facilities  blood inventory provisions  increased r d costs and reduced pricing related to contracts with major blood bank customers as mentioned above 
operating profit in biopharmaceutical decreased to from last year  attributable to costs to upgrade certain membrane filtration systems  reduced high margin sales in biosciences as well as amounts recognized in fiscal from an unfulfilled supply agreement that did not repeat in fiscal as mentioned above 
operating profit in industrial increased to from last year  attributable to the growth in aerospace coupled with improved industrial systems margins 
within industrial  general industrial operating profit increased to from last year attributable to improved margins on systems business 
aerospace operating profit improved to from in fiscal reflecting the strong sales growth in both commercial and military business 
microelectronics operating profit was compared with operating profit of last year 
the loss of some high margin microelectronics sales in the western hemisphere negatively impacted the operating profit margin year over year 
general corporate expenses were flat compared with last year as increased compensation related costs  the loss on the sale of an investment in the second quarter and increased corporate r d expenditures were offset by a million property tax refund 
by geography  western hemisphere sales increased compared with last year  while operating profit declined to from last year 
contributing to the profit decline were the blood products inventory provisions  costs to upgrade certain membrane filtration systems in the biopharmaceutical market  r d costs related to the development of pathogen reduction with our partner  vi technologies  inc  costs for a new blood set manufacturing facility in mexico  the loss of high margin biopharmaceutical and microelectronics sales  as well as price reductions in the blood filter product line 
additionally  fiscal included amounts recognized from an unfulfilled supply agreement that did not repeat in fiscal local currency sales for europe increased compared with prior year 
on a reported basis  sales declined reflecting the impact of the weakened euro  which decreased europe s sales by million 
operating profit in europe declined to from last year reflecting the weak euro  the blood products inventory provision  as well as costs to ramp up the blood systems plant in italy bought in the third quarter of last year 
asia s local currency sales increased compared with fiscal driven by strong sales in japan and korea 
a weakening of the yen late in the second quarter of caused the reported sales increases to be less than the local currency increase by million  or 
operating profit in asia improved to from last year due to strong sales volume  particularly in microelectronics  fuels chemicals and biopharmaceutical 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used at the end of fiscal for translating local currency amounts into us dollars 
in comparing spot exchange rates at the end of fiscal  the european and asian currencies especially the euro  the pound and the yen have strengthened against the us dollar 
the acquisition of fsg in the third quarter of fiscal was initially funded via a million day variable rate libor plus basis points credit facility of which million was repaid in the fourth quarter 
on august   we issued million of year bonds at an annual interest rate of 
the proceeds were utilized to repay a portion of the interim acquisition credit facility 
additionally  on october   we refinanced the remainder of the acquisition credit facility with a million term loan bearing interest based on libor 
as permitted by us generally accepted accounting principles  the consolidated balance sheet at august  reflects the remaining million of the interim acquisition facility as long term debt except for million that matures in fiscal  whereas the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects this amount within notes payable 
compared with fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  primarily due to the decrease in earnings as well as the payment of a rebate to a major blood bank customer in the first quarter of fiscal  partly offset by the effect of lower inventory levels 
the decline in inventory reflects improved inventory turnover resulting from improvements in supply chain management 
we purchased approximately million of treasury stock during fiscal  all of which was purchased in the first quarter  leaving million of the million the board of directors authorized for share repurchases in january offsetting the cash outlays to purchase stock were proceeds from stock plans of million for the year 
capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization expense were million and million  respectively 
fsg accounted for approximately million and million of the total capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization  respectively 
our goal is to keep capital expenditures at or below million in fiscal as mentioned previously  we modified our partnership agreement with vitex to eliminate shared research costs 
as such  the fourth quarter of fiscal included our last payment of shared r d costs 
we will fund a final million milestone payment for equity  provided they enroll their first patient in the phase iii clinical trials on or before december  when operating the business day to day  excluding acquisitions but including funding capital expenditures and buying back common stock  our guideline is to keep net debt debt net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at to of total capitalization net debt plus equity 
net debt increased by million compared with year end fiscal  attributable to the debt incurred to purchase fsg 
overall  net debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was compared with at year end fiscal our intention is to return to the levels that existed prior to the acquisition as quickly as possible 
we reduced our quarterly dividend to from the previous level 
the reduction in the quarterly dividend brings our dividend payout ratio to a level consistent with industry averages 
the approximately million in cash we will conserve annually may be used for future investments  debt reduction or other more tax efficient means of creating value for our shareholders 
the dividend action does not reflect a fundamental change in our earnings or asset quality outlook for the future 
we consider our existing lines of credit  along with the cash generated from operations  to be sufficient for future growth

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our acquisition of fsg at the end of the third quarter of fiscal has not materially changed our market risks 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on our earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
most of our products are manufactured in the us  including puerto rico  and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the japanese yen the yen and the euro  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar or the pound  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net income 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
the deterioration of the yen against the us dollar has a greater proportional adverse effect on our earnings because the majority of japan s purchases are sourced from the us during fiscal  the adverse change in the relationships of these exchange rates decreased net income by an estimated cents per share when compared with the exchange rates in effect during fiscal in fiscal year  the euro and the pound appreciated by approximately and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the exchange rates in effect in fiscal  while the yen depreciated by approximately 
additionally  the euro appreciated against the pound by approximately 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen denominated receivables held in the us and euro denominated receivables held in the united kingdom 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
in addition  we enter into loans denominated in foreign currencies to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables 
we do not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at august   these exposures amounted to approximately million and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of million 
if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates  net earnings would have decreased by approximately million  or approximately cent per share 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
our debt portfolio is comprised of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings 
during times of relatively stable interest rates  we view our primary interest rate risk to be potential near term decreases in earnings and cash flows due to increases in variable interest rates 
therefore  we have historically hedged these exposures by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swap agreements and also by natural hedges such as keeping excess funds invested in interest bearing securities that earn interest at floating rates 
however  due to the recent decreases in interest rates made by the federal reserve  we entered into a receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap on our million private placement fixed rate debt in august the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swaps typically mirror the cash flows of the underlying debt instruments and are  therefore  considered to be effective hedges 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
as of august   we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million outstanding 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps at august  was million 
for the year ended august   interest expense  net of interest income  was million  of which million was incurred on un hedged variable rate net debt 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates over the actual fiscal average rate would have had an immaterial impact on net interest expense and net earnings
