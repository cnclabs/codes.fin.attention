item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview management s discussion and analysis of the results of operation and financial condition of clear channel communications  inc and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting which includes all domestic and international radio assets and radio networks  outdoor advertising which includes domestic and international billboards  transit displays  street furniture and other outdoor advertising media  and live entertainment which includes live music  theatrical  family entertainment and motor sports events 
included in the other segment is television broadcasting  sports representation  and our media representation business  katz media 
results of operations we evaluate the operating performance of our businesses using several measures  one of them being ebitda as adjusted defined as revenue less divisional operating and corporate expenses 
ebitda as adjusted eliminates the uneven effect across our business segments  as well as in comparison to other companies  of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation and amortization recognized in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we have used the purchase method of accounting for all mergers and acquisitions in the history of our company 
non cash depreciation and amortization is significant due to the consolidation in our industry 
while we and many in the financial community consider ebitda as adjusted to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such as operating income and net income 
in addition  our definition of ebitda as adjusted is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we measure the performance of our operating segments and managers based on a pro forma measurement that includes adjustments to the prior period for all current and prior year acquisitions 
adjustments are made to the prior period to include the operating results of the acquisition for the corresponding period of time that the acquisition was owned in the current period 
in addition  results of operations from divested assets are excluded from all periods presented 
we believe pro forma is the best measure of our operating performance as it includes the performance of assets for the period of time we managed the assets 
pro forma is compared in constant us dollars us a currency exchange adjustment is made to the actual results to present foreign revenues and expenses in dollars allowing for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements

included in our fiscal year reported basis amounts are the revenues and divisional operating expenses for a twelve month period from our acquisitions  the most significant being sfx entertainment  inc  acquired august   amfm inc 
acquired on august   and donrey media group acquired on september  our sfx acquisition  valued at approximately billion entered us into the live entertainment industry 
this acquisition accounts for approximately billion of the total billion increase in reported revenue for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our amfm acquisition  valued at billion dramatically increased our ownership of radio stations 
this acquisition accounts for approximately billion of the total billion increase in reported revenue for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in reported revenue related to our less significant and acquisitions as well as the increase related to sfx and amfm were offset due to reasons discussed below in our pro forma presentation 
our sfx and amfm acquisitions account for approximately billion and million  respectively of the total billion increase in reported divisional operating expenses 
in addition to this increase  reported divisional operating expenses increased due to our less significant and acquisitions as well as the reasons discussed below in our pro forma presentation 
pro forma revenue decreased million or in fiscal year due to an overall softening of the advertising industry  especially as compared to the strong advertising environment during the majority of during  advertising rates were lower in our radio and outdoor business related to the decreased inventory demand within the advertising industry 
as the advertising environment softens  advertising rates decline and inventory demands weaken 
although the decrease in pro forma revenue was apparent in most markets  of the million decline  our top domestic radio and outdoor markets accounted for approximately million  or of the total decline 
the decline in pro forma revenue within these markets was predominately due to the decline in national advertising during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year similarly  our radio network revenue  which is primarily national sales  declined approximately million  or of the total decline during as compared to  again directly related to the decline in the overall economy 
the decline in pro forma revenue was partially offset by an million increase in pro forma revenue within our live entertainment division 
during  we changed the mix of live music events within this division to include approximately more stadium and arena events as compared to the prior year 
stadium and arenas are generally larger venues that allow for more ticket sales related to the increased seating capacity 
although pro forma revenue decreased  pro forma divisional operating expenses increased million  or in fiscal year this increase was partially due to the increase of selling costs and artist payments related to our change in the mix of live music events within the entertainment division as compared to fiscal year in addition  pro forma divisional operating expenses increased in our other segments relating to the reorganization of these business units as well as other expenses during the quarter ended december  these reorganizational expenses included severance  hiring costs  expenses associated with the shutdown of business units  certain contracts cost  as well as additional non cash promotion expenses  totaling approximately million 
the additional million of divisional operating expenses is comprised of approximately million of expenses associated with reorganization  restructuring  severance costs  and other miscellaneous items  with severance payments being the most significant component of the total 
the remaining million relates to divisional operating expenses associated with incremental costs under certain airport and transit panel contracts within our outdoor division as well as additional non cash promotion expenses within our radio division 
divisional operating expenses also increased during within the outdoor division related to new contract payments  and within our other segment associated with increases in television contract payments 
these increases in pro forma divisional operating expenses were partially offset by the reduction in selling costs associated with the decline in pro forma revenue in also  as discussed below  the terrorist attacks on september  negatively impacted the overall operating results for the later part of fiscal year as compared to the later part of fiscal year corporate expenses increased million on a reported basis primarily due to million of additional expense directly related to additional corporate employees obtained in our acquisitions 
in addition  corporate expenses increased due to the additional corporate employees hired subsequent to our acquisitions to accommodate for the growth of the company 
as a result of our acquisitions  we increased corporate head count throughout to employees as compared to employees at the end of fiscal year other income and expense information non cash compensation expense of million and million was recorded in fiscal year and  respectively 
this expense is primarily due to unvested stock options assumed in mergers that are now convertible into clear channel stock 
to the extent that these employees options continue to vest  we recognize non cash compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
vesting dates range from january to april if no employees forfeit their unvested options by leaving the company  we expect to recognize non cash compensation expense of approximately million during the remaining vesting period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from billion in to billion in  an increase 
the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization associated with the amfm and sfx acquisitions  which resulted in additional depreciation and amortization in aggregate of approximately million in as compared to in addition to the increase relating to recent acquisitions  depreciation expense includes million of impairment charges related primarily to the identification of duplicative and excess assets no longer necessary in our ongoing operations 
the majority of the impaired assets identified resulted from the continuing integration of recent acquisitions  as well as analog television equipment  and an impairment of an operating contract 
interest expense was million and million in and  respectively  an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was due to the overall increase in average amount of debt outstanding  partially offset by the decrease in libor rates 
approximately and of our debt was variable rate debt that bears interest based upon libor at december  and  respectively 
the month libor rates decreased from at december  to at december  the loss on sale of assets related to mergers in was million as compared to a gain of million in the loss on sale of assets related to mergers in is primarily due to a loss of million related to the sale of million shares of lamar advertising company acquired in the amfm merger  and a net loss of million related to write downs of other investments acquired in mergers 
this loss was partially offset by a gain of million realized on the sale of five stations in connection with governmental directives regarding the amfm merger 
the gain on sale of assets related to mergers of million in is primarily due to the sale of stations in connection with governmental directives regarding the amfm merger  which realized a gain of million 
this gain for was partially offset by a loss of million related to the sale of million shares of lamar advertising company that we acquired in the amfm merger  and a net loss of million related to write downs of investments acquired in mergers 
the gain on marketable securities is primarily related to the reclassification of million shares of american tower corporation to a trading security under financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
on january   the shares were transferred to a trading classification at their fair market value of million and an unrealized pretax holding gain of million was recognized 
during the year ended december   we entered into two secured forward exchange contracts that monetized part of our investment in american tower 
the fair value adjustment of the american tower trading shares and the secured forward exchange contract netted a gain of million during in addition  during  a loss of million was recognized related to impairments of other investments that had declines in their market values that were considered to be other than temporary 
equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period of the decrease was due to declining operating results primarily in our radio broadcasting equity investments 
for the year ended december  and  other income expense net was an income of million and an expense of million  respectively 
the additional income recognized in related primarily to a million gain on a non cash  tax free exchange of the assets of one television station for the assets of two television stations 
income taxes for the year ended december  and were provided at the federal and state statutory rates plus permanent differences 
the effective rates in all periods presented have been adversely impacted by permanent differences  primarily amortization of intangibles that is not deductible for tax purposes 
the september  terrorist attacks we have been adversely affected by the events of september   in new york  washington  dc  and pennsylvania  as well as by the actions taken by the united states in response to such events 
as a result of expanded news coverage following the attacks and subsequent military action  we experienced a loss in advertising revenues and increased incremental operating expenses 
the events of september have further depressed economic activity in the united states and globally  including the markets in which we operate

debt covenants the only significant covenants in our debt are leverage and interest coverage ratio covenants contained in the credit facilities 
the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined by the credit facilities of less than x through june  and less than x from july  through the maturity of the facilities 
the interest coverage covenant requires clear channel to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda as defined by the credit facilities to interest expense of x 
in the event that we do not meet these covenants  we are considered to be in default on the credit facilities at which time the credit facilities may become immediately due 
our bank credit facilities have cross default provisions among the bank facilities only 
no other clear channel debt agreements have cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
additionally  the amfm long term bonds contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of amfm operating inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of clear channel  to incur additional indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends  consolidate  or effect certain asset sales 
the amfm long term bonds have cross default and cross acceleration provisions among the amfm long term bonds only 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we expect to be in compliance during uses of capital acquisitions during we acquired radio stations in markets for million in cash  million in restricted cash plus the exchange of eight radio stations 
we also acquired approximately  additional outdoor display faces in domestic markets and approximately  additional display faces in international markets for a total of million in cash 
our outdoor segment also acquired investments in non consolidated affiliates for a total of million in cash 
during the year ended december   our live entertainment segment acquired music  sports and racing events  promotional assets and sports talent representation contracts for million in cash 
we also acquired fcc licenses of four television stations  two of which had previously been operating under local marketing agreements  national representation contracts  and other assets for a total of million in cash and million in restricted cash 
we intend to continue to pursue businesses that fit our strategic goals 
from january  through february   we have acquired six radio stations and  outdoor display faces 
pending merger on october   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire the ackerley group  inc ackerley holds a diversified group of outdoor  broadcasting and interactive media assets 
this merger will be a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
each share of ackerley common stock will convert into shares of our common stock  on a fixed exchange basis  valuing the merger  based on average share value at the signing of the merger agreement  at approximately million plus the assumption of ackerley s debt  which was approximately million at december  this merger is subject to regulatory approval under the federal communications laws and other closing conditions 
we anticipate that this merger will close during the first half of  however  we cannot be assured that we will complete the merger with ackerley in a timely manner or on the terms described in this document  if at all 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in increased from million in to million in overall  capital expenditures increased due to the increase in the number of radio stations  billboards and displays owned during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in addition  we incurred capital expenditures related to our new live entertainment segment during the year ended december  that we did not incur in the increase for the year ended december  primarily relates to additional spending relating to facility consolidation resulting from our acquisitions  technological upgrades of operating assets  and the purchase and construction of new revenue producing advertising displays 
in millions year ended december  capital expenditures corporate and radio outdoor entertainment other total recurring non recurring projects revenue producing our radio broadcasting capital expenditures during the year ended december  are related primarily to expenditures associated with the consolidation of operations in certain markets in conjunction with acquisitions that are expected to result in improved operating results in such markets 
our outdoor advertising capital expenditures during the year ended december  are related primarily to the construction of new revenue producing advertising displays as well as replacement expenditures on our existing advertising displays 
our live entertainment capital expenditures during the year ended december  include expenditures primarily related to a consolidated sales and operations facility  new venues and improvements to existing venues 
included in corporate and other capital expenditures during the year ended december  is the purchase of land for an additional corporate facility to replace leased space  purchase of certain corporate assets  upgrades of our television related operating assets and other technology expenditures 
future acquisitions of radio broadcasting stations  outdoor advertising facilities  live entertainment assets and other media related properties affected in connection with the implementation of our acquisition strategy are expected to be financed from increased borrowings under our existing credit facilities  additional public equity and debt offerings and cash flow from operations 
we anticipate utilizing available capacity on the credit facilities to refinance debt maturities 
we believe that cash flow from operations  as well as the proceeds from securities offerings made from time to time  will be sufficient to make all required future interest and principal payments on the credit facilities  senior convertible notes and bonds  and will be sufficient to fund all anticipated capital expenditures 
other during the year ended december   we made cash tax payments of million relating to gains realized on divested radio stations during also  we made payments of approximately million related to severance and other merger related accruals during commitments and contingencies there are various lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
in addition  we have minimum franchise payments associated to non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals 
finally  we have commitments relating to required purchases of property  plant and equipment under certain street furniture contracts  as well as construction commitments for facilities and venues 
the scheduled maturities of our credit facilities  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments  under non cancelable lease agreements  minimum rental payments under non cancelable contracts  and capital expenditure commitments at december  are as follows in millions other credit long term non cancelable non cancelable capital facilities debt lease contracts expenditures thereafter   total     market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor on billion of our current fixed rate borrowings 
these agreements expire from september to june the fair value of these agreements at december  was an asset of million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income loss by million and million  respectively 
at december   we also hold million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
we currently maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net loss for the year ended december  by million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by 
million and would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately 
million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement  accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
statement is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  statement eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
as we have historically used the purchase method to account for all business combinations  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement establishes new accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in business combinations 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
under this guidance  we believe broadcast licenses are indefinite lived intangibles 
as our amortization of goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangibles is a significant non cash expense that we currently record  statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
for the year ended december   amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles was approximately billion 
upon adoption of fas  for comparative purposes  we will be required to disclose the prior year earning per share data as if adoption had occurred january  below is this disclosure for each of the quarters of in thousands  except per share data for the quarter ended for the year ended march  june  september  december  december  adjusted net income loss reported net income loss      add back goodwill amortization      add back license amortization      tax impact      adjusted net income loss     basic earnings loss per share reported net income loss

we are currently evaluating valuation techniques as well as other implementation issues 
we will test goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of as a result of these tests  we expect to record a pre tax impairment charge in the range of billion to billion  which will be reported after tax as a cumulative effect in accounting change on the statement of operations for the quarter ended march  in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement removes goodwill from its scope and retains the requirements of statement regarding the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets held for use 
the statement modifies the accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and long lived assets to be disposed of by other than by sale 
we do not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies critical account policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note a in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the assets is reduced to reflect their current fair market value 
during  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to the write off of duplicative and excess assets identified primarily in our radio segment  the impairment of goodwill and excess property  plant and equipment within our outdoor segment  and an on air talent contract within our radio segment 
the fair values of the goodwill and the on air talent contract were determined based on discounted cash flow models and assumptions of future expected cash flows  and the fair values related to property  plant and equipment were based on estimated cash proceeds 
we considered the current economic recession as an impairment indicator during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we performed a recoverability assessment of all of our long lived assets using an undiscounted cash flow model 
based on our assumptions  all long lived assets  other than those mentioned above  were determined to be recoverable 
impairment of investments at december   we have million recorded as other investments 
other investments are composed primarily of equity securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale or trading and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
securities are carried at historical value when quoted market prices are unavailable 
the net unrealized gains or losses on the available for sale securities  net of tax  are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the net unrealized gains or losses on the trading securities are reported in the statement of operations 
in addition  we hold investments that do not have quoted market prices 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
during  we recorded impairments of million related to investments where declines in fair value below cost were considered to be other than temporary 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  for the year ended december   fixed charges exceeded earnings before income taxes and fixed charges by billion 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
