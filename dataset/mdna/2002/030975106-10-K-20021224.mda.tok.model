ebitda is included to provide additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the minimum quarterly distribution mqd and its performance 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from the definition used by other companies 
c results for fiscal reflect the elimination of goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pro forma operating income for fiscal and as if the adoption of sfas had occurred as of october  is million and million  respectively 
d deviation from average heating degree days during the year period from to  based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the continental united states 
fiscal compared with fiscal the partnership s fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by significantly warmer than normal heating season weather 
fiscal temperatures based upon heating degree day data provided by noaa were approximately warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal notwithstanding the impact of the warmer weather on heating related sales and the effects of a sluggish us economy on commercial sales  retail gallons sold increased million gallons principally as a result of the full year effect of the partnership s august   acquisition of columbia propane see note to consolidated financial statements and  to a much lesser extent  greater volumes from our ppx r grill cylinder exchange business 
the increase in ppx r sales principally reflects the effect on fiscal grill cylinder exchanges resulting from recently enacted national fire protection association nfpa guidelines and  to a lesser extent  the full year effects of fiscal increases in the number of ppx r distribution outlets 
the nfpa guidelines require that propane grill cylinders refilled after april   be fitted with overfill protection devices opds 
retail propane revenues were  million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal  reflecting a million decrease as a result of lower average selling prices partially offset by a million increase as a result of the greater retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  reflecting a million decrease due to lower average selling prices and a million decrease as a result of lower wholesale volumes sold 
the lower fiscal retail and wholesale selling prices resulted from lower fiscal propane product costs 
revenues from other sales and services increased million primarily due to the full year impact of columbia propane 
total cost of sales declined million in fiscal reflecting lower average propane product costs and the lower wholesale sales partially offset by the higher retail gallons sold 
total margin increased million reflecting the full year volume impact of the columbia propane acquisition and a million increase in total margin from ppx r reflecting higher volumes and unit margins 
ppx r propane unit margins in fiscal were higher than in fiscal reflecting increases in sales prices to fund opd valve replacement capital expenditures on out of compliance grill cylinders 
the extent to which this greater level of ppx r margin is sustainable in the future will depend upon a number of factors  including the continuing rate of opd valve replacement and competitive market conditions 
ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  minority interests  equity investee income  and the cumulative effect of accounting changes increased million in fiscal as the significant increase in total margin was substantially offset by an million increase in partnership operating and administrative expenses and a decrease in other income 
ebitda of ppx r increased approximately million in fiscal partially offsetting the effects of the significantly warmer winter weather on our heating related volumes 
although ebitda is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  it is included in this analysis to provide additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the minimum quarterly distribution of mqd and for evaluating the partnership s performance 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from the definition of ebitda used by other companies 
the greater operating and administrative expenses in fiscal resulted primarily from the full year impact of the columbia propane acquisition and higher volume driven ppx r expenses 
during fiscal  the partnership completed its planned blending of columbia propane distribution locations with existing partnership locations 
as a result of these district consolidations and other cost reduction activities  management believes that at september  it achieved its anticipated million reduction in annualized operating cost savings subsequent to the acquisition of columbia propane 
operating income increased million  significantly more than the increase in ebitda  principally due to the cessation of goodwill amortization in fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas see note to consolidated financial statements partially offset by higher depreciation and intangible asset amortization associated with columbia propane and higher ppx r depreciation 
fiscal operating income includes million of goodwill amortization 
interest expense increased million principally reflecting higher partnership long term debt outstanding resulting from the columbia propane acquisition partially offset by lower bank credit agreement borrowings and lower short term interest rates 
fiscal compared with fiscal retail propane gallons sold increased million gallons primarily due to the effects of colder weather and the impact of acquisitions  including the august  acquisition of columbia propane 
temperatures based upon heating degree days were colder than normal in fiscal compared to temperatures that were warmer than normal in fiscal the greater acquisition and weather related sales were reduced by customer conservation resulting from higher product costs and a slowing us economy 
the wholesale price of propane at mont belvieu  texas  a major us supply point  reached a high of cents per gallon in fiscal compared to a high of cents per gallon during fiscal total revenues from retail propane sales increased million reflecting a million increase as a result of higher average selling prices and a million increase as a result of the higher retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million principally reflecting higher average prices and greater sales associated with product cost management activities 
cost of sales increased million as a result of higher per unit propane product costs and the greater retail and wholesale volumes sold 
total margin increased million due to the impact of higher than normal average retail unit margins and  to a lesser extent  the greater retail propane volumes sold 
retail propane unit margins in fiscal benefited from gains on derivative hedge instruments and favorably priced supply arrangements 
the significant increase in ebitda in fiscal resulted from the increase in margin partially offset by a million increase in partnership operating and administrative expenses 
operating and administrative expenses of the partnership were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal adjusting fiscal expenses for the impact of the partnership s change in accounting for tank installation costs  operating and administrative expenses of the partnership increased million 
the higher fiscal expenses reflect higher employee related costs  including greater overtime and incentive compensation costs  growth related expenses  including the impact of columbia propane and other acquisitions  and expenses associated with our ppx r grill cylinder exchange business  and higher distribution costs  including vehicle fuel and lease expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of the partnership increased million reflecting greater depreciation associated with acquisitions and million of depreciation expense resulting from the change in accounting for tank installation costs 
the partnership s interest expense increased million principally as a result of greater amounts of long term debt outstanding 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million 
included in this amount is million outstanding under amerigas olp s revolving credit facility 
in december  amerigas partners issued  common units to the public through an underwritten public offering 
in january  the underwriters exercised a portion of their overallotment option in the amount of  shares 
the net proceeds from these common unit offerings  an october sale of  common units to the general partner  and related capital contributions by the general partner in order to maintain its general partner interests in the partnership of million were contributed to amerigas olp and used to reduce bank credit agreement borrowings and for working capital 
the partnership also completed a number of debt transactions during fiscal in november  amerigas partners prepaid million of senior notes at a redemption price of 
in april  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes from then existing cash balances and revolving credit facility borrowings 
in may  amerigas partners issued million of senior notes due at an effective interest rate of 
the proceeds were contributed to amerigas olp and  along with related general partner capital contributions  used to reduce revolving credit facility borrowings and for working capital and general business purposes 
on december   after the end of fiscal  amerigas partners issued million of senior notes due at an effective interest rate of 
the net proceeds will be used to redeem in january the remaining million of senior notes of amerigas partners at a redemption price of 
in august  amerigas olp amended and restated its bank credit agreement 
amerigas olp s bank credit agreement expires october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
there was million outstanding under this facility at september  issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
amerigas olp may borrow under its acquisition facility to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets 
in addition to the million available under the revolving credit facility  the bank credit agreement allows up to million of the acquisition facility to be used for working capital purposes 
there were no loans outstanding under the acquisition facility at september  amerigas olp could borrow up to million under the acquisition facility based upon eligible propane business and asset expenditures made through september  amerigas olp also has a credit agreement with the general partner to borrow up to million on an unsecured  subordinated basis  for working capital and general purposes 
ugi has agreed to contribute up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
amerigas partners also has debt and equity shelf registration statements with the us securities and exchange commission sec 
the partnership must maintain certain financial ratios in order to borrow under the bank credit agreement including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio 
the partnership s ratios calculated as of september  permit it to borrow up to the maximum amount available 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under its bank credit agreement  and the expected refinancing of its maturing long term debt  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal partnership distributions since its formation in  the partnership has paid the mqd on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests in fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the number of partnership units outstanding on september   the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests is approximately million 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be calculated by subtracting from the partnership s ebitda cash interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity 
partnership distributable cash flow as calculated under this method for fiscal  and is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars ebitda cash interest expense a maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash flow a interest expense adjusted for noncash items 
although distributable cash flow is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash generated by the partnership  it does not reflect  among other things  the impact of changes in working capital  which can significantly affect cash available for distribution  and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the mqd 
the partnership s definition of distributable cash flow may be different from the definition used by other companies 
although the levels of distributable cash flow in fiscal and were less than the full mqd  other sources of cash  including cash from equity offerings and borrowings  was more than sufficient to permit the partnership to pay the full mqd 
the ability of the partnership to pay the mqd on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its bank credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  the cost of propane and changes in capital market conditions 
conversion of subordinated units pursuant to the agreement of limited partnership of amerigas partners  the million amerigas partners subordinated units held by the general partner as of september  were eligible to convert to common units on the first day after the record date for any quarter ending on or after march  in respect of which certain cash based performance and distribution requirements were met 
in december  the general partner determined that the cash based performance and distribution requirements in respect of the quarter ended september  had been met and  as a result  the remaining million subordinated units held by the general partner were converted to common units effective november  the conversion of the subordinated units did not result in an increase in the number of amerigas partners limited partner units outstanding 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations under agreements existing as of september  in millions 
fiscal fiscal thereafter total long term debt operating leases total  cash flows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal changes in operating working capital during fiscal provided million of operating cash flow compared to million of such cash flow in fiscal investing activities 
we spent million for property  plant and equipment including maintenance capital expenditures of million during fiscal compared with million including maintenance capital expenditures of million during fiscal the increase in capital expenditures reflects higher expenditures for ppx r  principally grill cylinder opds to comply with nfpa guidelines  and expenditures associated with the addition of the columbia propane businesses 
proceeds from asset sales were higher in fiscal reflecting  in part  disposals of columbia propane excess assets 
financing activities 
during fiscal and  we declared and paid the mqd on all common and subordinated units and the general partner interests 
during fiscal  we sold  common units to the general partner  and  common units to the public in conjunction with an underwritten public offering 
the combined net proceeds of these sales and related capital contributions from the general partner of million were contributed to amerigas olp and used to reduce bank credit agreement borrowings and for working capital 
during fiscal  amerigas partners redeemed million of its senior notes and amerigas olp repaid million of borrowings outstanding under its acquisition facility and million of maturing first mortgage notes 
also during fiscal  amerigas partners issued million of senior notes and contributed the proceeds to amerigas olp to reduce indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and for working capital and general business purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
the following policies require management s most subjective or complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
litigation accruals 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability  and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from two to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane are principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs  and the partnership generally attempts to pass on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
in order to minimize credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we carefully monitor established credit limits with the contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s bank credit agreement 
these debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  combined borrowings outstanding under these agreements totaled million and million  respectively 
based upon weighted average borrowings outstanding under these agreements during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by million and million  respectively 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were an adverse change in the market price of propane of cents per gallon and interest rates on ten year us treasury notes of basis points change in fair value fair value millions of dollars september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under sfas  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated underlying transactions
