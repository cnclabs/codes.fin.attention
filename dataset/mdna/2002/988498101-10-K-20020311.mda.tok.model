item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction tricon global restaurants  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as tricon or the company is comprised of the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
separately  each brand ranks in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units 
our  international units make us the second largest qsr company outside the us tricon became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
tricon has numerous registered trademarks and service marks 
we believe that many of these marks  including our kentucky fried chicken  kfc  pizza hut and taco bell trademarks  have significant value and are materially important to our business 
our policy is to pursue registration of important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks 
from time to time we may become involved in litigation to defend and protect our use of such registered marks 
the use of our trademarks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in kfc  pizza hut and taco bell franchise and license agreements 
under current law and with proper use  our rights in trademarks can generally last indefinitely 
we also have certain patents on restaurant equipment which  while valuable  are not material to our business 
throughout management s discussion and analysis md a  we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss gain  unusual items income expense and our accounting and human resources policy changes in the accounting changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions 
we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance 
ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the us and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in  our international business  tricon restaurants international tri or international accounted for of system sales  of revenues and of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss 
we anticipate that  despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations  we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages through and the cautionary statements on page all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages through tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that required us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
we believe that our most significant policies require estimation of cash flows associated with the disposition of restaurants  and the impairment of long lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates

franchisee financial condition like others in the qsr industry  from time to time  some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations 
during and  certain of our franchise operators  principally in the taco bell system experienced varying degrees of financial problems 
depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation  and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisee s business trends  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues 
these include a sale of some or all of the operator s restaurants to us or a third party  a restructuring of the operator s business and or finances  or  in the more unusual cases  bankruptcy of the operator 
it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 
through february   restructurings have been completed for approximately  taco bell franchise restaurants 
in connection with these restructurings  taco bell has acquired restaurants for approximately million through december  in addition to these acquisitions  taco bell purchased restaurants from franchisees for approximately million and simultaneously leased the restaurants back to these franchisees under long term leases 
as part of the restructurings  taco bell has committed to fund approximately million of future franchise capital expenditures  principally through leasing arrangements 
in the fourth quarter of  taco bell established a million loan program to assist certain franchisees 
all fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of  and the resulting notes receivable are primarily included in other assets 
we believe that the recent improvement in business trends at taco bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the taco bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales 
accordingly  though we continue to monitor this situation  we expect restructurings of the remaining taco bell franchise restaurants with financial issues to be significantly less in number and costs in in and  the company charged expenses of million and million  respectively  to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables 
these costs are reported as franchise and license expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we assess our exposure from franchise related risks  which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables  contingent lease liabilities  guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees 
the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the contingent liabilities section of note although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time  we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of december  it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs  however  these cost are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
unusual items income expense we recorded unusual items income of million in and unusual items expense of million in and million in see note for a detailed discussion of our unusual items income expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded expenses of approximately million related to streamlining certain support functions  which included the termination of approximately employees 
the reserves established  which primarily related to severance  were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of we expect to incur additional costs of approximately million in related to these actions  which will be expensed as incurred 
beginning in  we anticipate savings in general and administrative expenses g a of approximately million per year  primarily related to reduced compensation 
however  we expect to reinvest a substantial portion of these savings in our growth initiatives  including multibranding 
impact of new unconsolidated affiliates consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets  we formed new ventures in canada and poland with our largest franchisee in each market 
the venture in canada was formed in the third quarter of and the venture in poland was effective in the first quarter of the canadian venture operates over stores and the poland venture operates approximately stores 
we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures 
previously  the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated 
the impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities  which is described in the store portfolio strategy section below 
consequently  these transactions resulted in a decline in our company sales  restaurant margin dollars and g a as well as higher franchise fees 
we also record equity income losses from investments in unconsolidated affiliates equity income and  in canada  higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture 
the formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate at the beginning of  we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate 
this change resulted in higher company sales  restaurant margin dollars and g a as well as decreased franchise fees and equity income 
this previously unconsolidated affiliate operates over stores 
fifty third week in our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every or years 
fiscal year included a fifty third week in the fourth quarter 
the estimated favorable impact in net income was million or per diluted share in the following table summarizes the estimated favorable unfavorable impact of the fifty third week on system sales  revenues and ongoing operating profit us international unallocated total system sales revenues company sales franchise fees total revenues ongoing operating profit franchise fees restaurant margin general and administrative expenses ongoing operating profit store portfolio strategy since  we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
this portfolio balancing activity has reduced our reported revenues and restaurant profits and has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure 
we substantially completed our refranchising program in the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax a a 
includes million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of million to mark to market the net assets of the singapore business  which is held for sale 
in addition to our refranchising program  we have been closing restaurants over the past several years 
restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants  restaurants that are relocated to a new site within the same trade area or us pizza hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine in traditional store within the same trade area 
the following table summarizes company store closure activities number of units closed store closure costs a impairment charges for stores to be closed a 
includes favorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge of million in see note for a discussion of these adjustments

in  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
the decrease was primarily due to unusual charges related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process and the related use of working capital 
the primary driver of the net use of working capital was an increase in receivables arising from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process  which resulted in a net use of working capital of approximately million 
excluding these ameriserve related items  cash from operating activities increased by million to million 
this increase was driven by a lower reduction of our working capital deficit than in our working capital deficit  excluding cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and short term borrowings  is typical of restaurant operations where a majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment terms  generally from days 
the lower working capital deficit reduction in is the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in versus  partially offset by a change in payment terms in our food and supply distribution agreement from to days 
net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in and increased acquisition and capital spending 
the increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a debtor in possession revolving credit facility to ameriserve in in  net cash used in investing activities was million versus net cash provided of million in the decline in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants to franchisees in versus  increased capital spending related to development and funding of a debtor in possession revolving credit facility to ameriserve 
although we report gross proceeds in our consolidated statements of cash flows  we also consider refranchising proceeds on an after tax basis 
we define after tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities primarily accounts payable and property taxes related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains 
the after tax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares 
after tax proceeds were approximately million in which reflects a decrease from this decrease was due to the refranchising of fewer restaurants in versus after tax proceeds were approximately million in  a decrease versus this decrease was also due to refranchising fewer restaurants in than net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in the increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in compared to in  net cash used in financing activities decreased to million versus billion in due to lower debt repayments 
less cash was available for financing activities in due to lower cash flow from operating and investing activities  as described above 
in february  our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program 
this program authorizes us to repurchase  through february   up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million 
see note for a discussion of the share repurchase program 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees 
this share repurchase program was completed in during  we repurchased over million shares for approximately million 
see note for a discussion of the share repurchase program 
financing activities as more fully discussed in note  our primary bank credit agreement  as amended  is comprised of a senior  unsecured term loan facility and a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which was reduced from billion as part of the amendment discussed below collectively referred to as the credit facilities 
the credit facilities mature on october  at december   we had unused revolving credit facility borrowings available aggregating billion  net of outstanding letters of credit of billion 
amounts outstanding under our credit facilities of million at december  have been classified as short term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet due to the october maturity 
we are currently in negotiations to replace the credit facilities prior to the maturity date with new borrowings  which will reflect the market conditions and terms available at that time 
the credit facilities subject us to certain mandatory principal repayment obligations  including prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on the credit facilities is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin factor  therefore  our borrowing costs fluctuate depending upon the volatility in libor 
on february   we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms of our credit facilities 
this amendment provides for  among other things  additional flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments 
in addition  we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the revolving credit facility from billion to billion 
as a result of this amendment  we capitalized debt costs of approximately million 
these costs will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the credit facilities 
we issued million of unsecured notes in the issuance included million of senior unsecured notes due april  and million of senior unsecured notes due april  we used the proceeds  net of issuance costs  to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facilities 
we still have million available for issuance under a billion shelf registration 
see note for further discussion 
we use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  to lower interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
see notes and as well as our market risk disclosure for further discussion of our interest rate risk 
consolidated financial condition assets increased million or to billion 
the increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in property  plant and equipment driven by capital spending and acquisitions in excess of depreciation  refranchising and disposition of assets 
the fair value of derivatives recorded as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in net receivables primarily related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
liabilities decreased million or to billion 
the decrease was primarily attributable to net paydown of debt  partially offset by increases related to the adoption of sfas liquidity operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited tricon investment in operating assets 
typically  our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending 
though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations  we believe our operating cash flows and our ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  due by year include less than year years years thereafte r total long term debt a short term borrowings debt excluding capital leases operating leases b capital leases b franchisee financing obligations contractual obligations  a 
excludes the derivative instrument adjustment  which is discussed in note b 
these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to operating and capital leases for approximately  restaurants 
see note for a discussion of short term borrowings and long term debt and note for a discussion of leases 
in addition  we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
as of december   the maximum exposure under these commercial commitments  which are shown on a nominal basis  include contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments standby letters of credit a guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates debt other commercial commitments a 
includes million related to guarantees of financial arrangements of franchisees  which are supported by stand by letters of credit 
see notes and for a further discussion of these commitments 
our unconsolidated affiliates also have long term debt outstanding 
as of december  this debt totaled approximately million  our share of which was approximately million 
as noted above  we have guaranteed million of this total debt obligation 
our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over million as of year end and total revenues of approximately billion in other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact ongoing operating profit comparisons with euro conversion twelve of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union adopted the euro as a common legal currency 
we have company and franchise businesses in the adopting member countries 
beginning january   new euro denominated bills and coins were issued  and a transition period of two months began 
during the transition period local currencies were removed from circulation 
we took actions to mitigate our risks related to the euro conversion efforts including the rollout of euro ready point of sale pos equipment and back of house hardware and software 
we have not experienced any significant issues or unexpected business problems resulting from the euro conversion 
given the absence of any significant problems to date  we do not expect euro conversion issues to have a material adverse effect on tricon s operations or financial results in expenditures associated with our conversion efforts totaled approximately million of which million was incurred during approximately of these costs related to capital expenditures for new pos equipment and back of house hardware and software 
the remaining expenditures were mainly related to consulting expenses for initial impact studies and head office accounting systems 
we do not expect to incur significant euro related expenditures in consumer acceptance of the euro has not significantly impacted our business to date 
from a competitive perspective  we continue to assess the impact of product price transparency  potential revisions to our product bundling strategies  and the creation of euro friendly price points 
we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses 
new accounting pronouncements see note quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of million and million  respectively  in annual income before taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our interest rate swaps at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the significant change in the decrease of the fair market value between and was primarily due to the additional senior unsecured notes issued in fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk international ongoing operating profit constituted approximately and of our and ongoing operating profit  respectively  excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion and million as of december  and december   respectively 
operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our risk exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
on a limited basis  we utilize forward contracts in order to reduce our risk exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated cash flows from royalties 
there were no such forward contracts outstanding as of december  commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
there were no commodity future and option contracts outstanding at december   and those outstanding at december   were not significant to the consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the spin off  which  if they occur  require us to indemnify pepsico  inc  our substantial debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future  as well as our substantial interest expense and principal repayment obligations  our ability to replace or refinance the credit facilities at reasonable rates  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities including the liabilities related to the sale of the non core businesses  our ability to secure alternative distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  our ability to complete our euro conversion plans or the ability of our key suppliers to be euro compliant  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  global and local business  economic and political conditions  legislation and governmental regulation  competitor activities  success of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates
