the line of credit is secured by all assets of the company 
the agreement prohibits the company from paying dividends without prior approval and requires that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth 
at june   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
subsequent to year end  the company and silicon amended the agreement to increase the maximum credit limit on the line of credit to  and to add an additional  term loan to the agreement 
under the amended agreement  borrowing on the line of credit is restricted to the maximum credit limit which is calculated as the lesser of  or of the company s eligible receivables plus the lesser of of the company s eligible inventory  or of the company s eligible receivables  or  the agreement matures on september  the interest rate on the line of credit is equal to the prime rate plus 
the interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly basis to prime rate plus if the company achieves a quick ratio cash and cash equivalents to current liabilities for two consecutive fiscal quarters of greater than or equal to to but less than to

the company used the proceeds from this sale  plus the  in new bank debt  plus cash on hand to acquire motors products for  on july  the motor product operations acquired have historically and are currently generating positive cash flows 
the company believes the acquisition will have a positive effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources although there can be no guarantee thereof 
subsequent to june   the company agreed to settle an environmental contamination lawsuit pursuant to which hathaway  with other parties  was named as a defendant 
the settlement  exclusive of estimated legal costs  will be paid as follows  within days after the settlement is approved by the court   one year after the court approval and the remaining  two years after court approval 
the related legal fees are expected to be paid by december  the settlement is subject to court approval  and therefore  the amount of the settlement will be fixed only upon such approval  and is subject to change prior to that time

the company believes the capital currently available to it is sufficient for its currently anticipated needs  but if additional capital is needed in the future  the company would pursue additional capital via debt or equity financing 
a key component of the company s liquidity relates to the availability of amounts under the line of credit with silicon valley bank 
any lack of availability of this facility could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of june   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
the line of credit matures in september the company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates that are tied to various market indices 
as a result  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
a change in the interest rate of on the company s variable rate debt would have the impact of changing interest expense by approximately  annually 
foreign currency risk after july   upon the sale of the power and process business  the company had a wholly owned subsidiary located in england 
sales from this operation are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the british us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the british pound

the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on historical experience and judgment based on current economic and customer specific factors 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers 
the company s warranty obligation is based upon historical experience and is also affected by estimates of product failure rates and material usage incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates or material usage costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company establishes inventory valuation allowances for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions and future demand are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards

the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
under standards applicable at june   the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected undiscounted cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts 
however  if such projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  even by one dollar  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a more restrictive fair value test to evaluate goodwill

 sop and sop under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed 
the company typically uses costs incurred on the arrangement as the basis to determine the percentage of work completed 
the use of the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires estimates of percentage of project completion and total estimated project costs upon completion 
the judgments made in this area could i have a significant effect on revenue recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized  and ii determine whether an overall loss on an arrangement is required to be recorded
