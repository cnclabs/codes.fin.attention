critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
store closure accrual in estimating the costs associated with closing a store the company must make assumptions regarding  among other things  lease termination costs  the amount of time before the location can be subleased if at all and the amount of sublease income

amounts due from banks have historically been collectable 
collection of amounts receivable from warrantors and vendor programs generally depend on detailed documentation that may be disputed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes
