item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its telco access products tap product lines  particularly the sale of network interface units and related products 
niu products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products represented approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal  which constituted approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
on march   the company acquired of the outstanding shares of teltrend inc  a designer  manufacturer and marketer of transmission products used by telephone companies to provide voice and data service over the telephone network 
the company s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services 
they are managed separately because each business requires different technologies and market strategies 
they consist of a telecommunications equipment manufacturer of local loop access products  which include telco access products and broadband products  and a multi point telecommunications service bureau  conference plus  inc  specializing in audio teleconferencing  multi point video conferencing  broadcast fax and multimedia teleconference services 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in addition  to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and expand its sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
as a result of the significant increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses related to new product and market development  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted in fiscal  and the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities and expects to receive funding from certain partners to offset a portion of these development costs 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which is expected to adversely affect short term results of operations 
the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will principally depend on its success in increasing sales of dsl products and developing new and enhanced tap and other dsl products 
in view of the company s reliance on the emerging dsl market for growth and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenues  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from tap products such as niu s have declined in recent years as telcos continue to move to networks that deliver higher speed digital transmission services 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable the company sells products primarily to various telecommunications providers and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
judgement is required in assessing the realization of these receivables based on aging  historical experience and customer s financial condition 
inventory reserves the company reviews ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company evaluates ending inventory for lower of cost or market 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates and normally do not extend beyond one year 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues  as there was in fiscal  the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for anticipated losses on such commitments in warranty the company reserves for warranty costs based on expected return quantities and expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
goodwill and intangibles the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or acquired business are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
effective april   the company will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

net loss the company s quarterly equipment revenues have varied from quarter to quarter due primarily to quarterly fluctuations in dsl revenues 
tap revenues in the second and third quarters of fiscal were negatively affected by lost production capacity during the integration of the teltrend inc manufacturing facility with the westell facility in aurora  illinois 
conference plus service revenues have seen steady growth through each quarter of fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal due primarily to increased audio conference calling traffic volume 
service revenues decreased in the final two quarters of fiscal due to the slowing economy 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue has also varied from quarter to quarter 
the low margins in the fiscal and fiscal quarters are primarily a result of the increased volume in dsl products that have relatively low margins 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an inventory adjustment to market value and excess inventory charge of million of which million relates to inventory on hand and million relates to inventory purchase commitments in excess of anticipated requirements 
due to anticipated slow demand in certain products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an inventory adjustment to market value and excess inventory charge of million 
fiscal year margins were also negatively affected by production inefficiencies related to the integration of teltrend inc  which was acquired by the company during march the teltrend inc manufacturing facility was combined with the westell facility in aurora  illinois during the second quarter of fiscal and caused production inefficiencies during the second and third quarters of fiscal additionally  the company s conference plus  inc subsidiary made additional infrastructure enhancements to handle increased call minutes  which also impacted margins in fiscal the company believes that its gross margin in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including market demand for the company s dsl products  pricing pressures  competitive technologies and manufacturing expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase gross margins in future periods due to these factors  even if its dsl products achieve market acceptance 
operating expenses decreased in the fiscal quarters compared to fiscal primarily due to the restructuring the company has implemented in response to the slowing economy and lack of general demand in the telecom industry 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased in the last three quarters of fiscal due to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges taken during the quarters 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and on its ability to achieve profitability

this revolving credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of target ebitda and tangible net worth 
the company was not in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility at march  the company and its lenders have entered into an amendment and waiver under which the covenant violations were waived 
on june   the company amended the revolving credit facility 
the amendment provides for a million non amortizing term loan and a million revolving credit facility  both due june  the term loan is secured by  among other things  a security interest in certain collateral granted by certain stockholders 
the amendment also terminates the million guarantee provided by trusts of robert c 
penny iii and other penny family members

the company had million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and was eligible to borrow an additional million as of july on may   the company signed two subordinated promissory notes with solectron technology sdn bhd 
one note in the amount of million is for the payment of inventory held by solectron that the company is committed to buy 
the second note in the amount of million is for the payment of accounts payable and accrued interest 
both notes require a weekly principal and monthly interest payment and are payable over years

this note was part of the settlement of litigation with celsian 
all three notes bear an interest rate of prime plus 
at march  the company had various operating leases for facilities and equipment 
the total minimum future rental payments are million  million  million  million  million and million for fiscal years     and thereafter  respectively 
the company s operating activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively and generated cash of million in fiscal cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million net of depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations of million excluding depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
cash generated by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in inventories and accounts receivable

capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were principally for machinery  computer and research equipment purchases 
the company expects to spend approximately million in fiscal for capital equipment 
at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under its secured revolving promissory notes facility 
to meet the company s cash needs for fiscal year  the company is exploring various alternatives including the sale of non strategic assets 
cash in excess of operating requirements will be used to pay down debt or invested on a short term basis in federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade commercial paper 
the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million at march  the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured as the company has incurred operating losses for the  and fiscal years  management believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the tax benefit 
portions of these deferred tax assets are expected to be utilized  prior to their expiration  through a tax planning strategy available to the company 
management will continue to periodically assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
if the tax planning strategy is not sufficient to generate taxable income to recover the deferred tax benefit recorded  an increase in the valuation allowance will be required through a charge to the income tax provision 
however  if the company achieves sufficient profitability or has available additional tax planning strategies to utilize a greater portion of the deferred tax asset  an income tax benefit would be recorded to decrease the valuation allowance
