any sentence followed by an asterisk in this section constitutes a forward looking statement which reflects the company s current expectations 
there can be no assurance the company s actual performance will not differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to the important factors described in the section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations titled certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations versus net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the comparison for all segments is affected by a week fiscal year in as compared to a week fiscal year in the sales decrease by segment was comprised of a million decrease in direct marketing us  a million decrease in apparel and a million decrease in packaging and display products  which management believes are principally attributable to an economic slowdown 
the million decrease in international is due to the effect of exchange rate changes 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in the sales of the company s direct sales us segment due to expanding sales presence and bank relationships 

table of contents for fiscal year  cost of sales declined to of net sales from in fiscal year the company s cost management strategies and the effect of actions announced taken in all segments offset the impact of the decrease in sales on cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percent of sales is expected to remain relatively consistent with fiscal year during fiscal year selling and advertising expense decreased to of sales in fiscal year as compared to of sales in fiscal year the company s adoption of sfas  which decreased the amortization charge in the current fiscal year  positively impacted selling and advertising expense 
this decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in the proportion of sales coming from the direct sales us segment  which has a higher selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales than in the company s other business segments due to its selling structure depending on a direct sales force 
selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales is expected to be slightly lower during fiscal year general and administrative expense decreased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year general and administrative expenses in fiscal year included an impairment charge of million for the write off of capitalized internal use software related to an enterprise resource planning system the company no longer plans to implement 
the company also recognized an impairment charge in fiscal year of 
million for the write off of its investment in a privately owned web hosting company 
these charges are included in general and administrative expenses 
excluding the asset impairment write off  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for fiscal year approximated  which is consistent with fiscal year general and administrative expense as a percent of sales is expected to be slightly higher during fiscal year during fiscal year  the company undertook two separate restructuring actions 
the first resulted in a restructuring charge of million in fiscal year and an additional charge of million in fiscal year to provide for costs primarily associated with the company s decision to more closely align its direct marketing and direct sales activities 
as part of the restructuring program  the mcbee us headquarters was relocated from parsippany  new jersey to the existing rapidforms facility in thorofare  new jersey 
in addition  the mcbee manufacturing plant in damascus  virginia was closed and a portion of leased warehousing space occupied by chiswick in sudbury  massachusetts was vacated 
in canada  the mcbee sales and marketing organizations were combined with nebs direct marketing and are operating under the nebs name 
approximately employees were affected by the restructuring either through elimination of their positions or relocation 
the second restructuring action resulted in the company recording an additional restructuring charge in fiscal year of million and a credit of 
million in fiscal year to provide for costs associated with the company s decision to eliminate excess capacity by closing a manufacturing facility in ogden  utah and a leased distribution facility in sudbury  massachusetts  along with other actions to reduce the workforce in various locations 
approximately employees were affected by the restructuring  either through elimination of their positions or relocation 
the following is a table of the charges incurred and the cash paid pursuant to these actions in thousands of dollars first restructuring second restructuring employee termination benefit costs facility closure costs employee termination benefit costs facility closure costs total balance  june  charge credit for the period payments for the period balance june  charge credit for the period payments for the period balance  june  
table of contents the activities related to all restructuring actions identified above are anticipated to be completed by the company during fiscal year with the exception of lease payments  which may extend beyond this time frame 
interest expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year the increase is the result of additional debt  primarily from an additional investment in advantage payroll services  inc in the first quarter and significant additional treasury share repurchases in the third quarter of fiscal year both of which increased the company s average debt outstanding in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due to a decrease in the company s overall effective state tax rate 
the company will continue to seek opportunities to acquire companies  businesses and product lines to enhance the company s competitive position in the marketplace or to gain access to new markets  products  competencies or technologies 
in addition  the company will continue to seek opportunities to enhance the cost structure of the company  to improve operating efficiencies  and to fund investments in support of the company s strategies 
versus net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the comparison for all segments is affected by a week fiscal year in as compared to a week fiscal year in the sales results included a million increase associated with the direct sales us and packaging and display segments 
also included in the year to year consolidated increase are million in sales from the premiumwear  inc operation  which makes up the apparel segment  purchased in july and hence not part of the comparable figures for fiscal year these increases were offset by a slight decline of million in sales of the company s direct marketing us and international segments 
for fiscal year  cost of sales increased to of sales from in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to the addition of premiumwear  which incurs a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales than the company s other businesses 
excluding premiumwear  cost of sales was of sales  which is consistent with fiscal year in fiscal  increased handling charges and freight discounts and improvement in plant efficiencies were offset by increases in material costs year to year due to a shift in product sales towards outsourced products 
selling and advertising expense decreased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year the year to year decrease was due primarily to the addition of premiumwear  which has a significantly lower selling and advertising expense as a percentage of sales than in the company s other businesses 
general and administrative expense declined as a percentage of sales from of sales in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease was due to the lower general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales incurred by premiumwear 
additionally  during the year  the company recognized an impairment charge of million for the write off of capitalized internal use software related to an enterprise resource planning system the company no longer plans to implement 
the company also recognized an impairment charge of 
million for the write off of its investment in a privately owned web hosting company 
these charges are included in general and administrative expenses 
excluding the asset impairment write off and the effect of premiumwear  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for fiscal year approximated 
without considering the effect of premiumwear  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales would have climbed due to increased investment in information systems and general corporate expenses 
interest expense increased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year the increase is the result of additional debt  primarily from the investment in advantage payroll services  inc in march  the premiumwear acquisition in july  additional treasury share repurchases  and higher interest rates in fiscal 
table of contents the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the lower fiscal year provision was due to a favorable letter ruling affecting prior years state tax rates 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  and incomes taxes 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized on product sales at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the company generally obtains purchase authorizations from its customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and considers delivery to have occurred at the point of shipment 
while the company does provide its customers with a right of return  revenue is not deferred 
rather  a reserve for sales returns is provided based on significant historical experience 
asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  investments  capitalized software  goodwill  deferred mail costs and intangible and other assets 
asset valuation is governed by various accounting principles  including statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of to be superceded in fiscal year by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and accounting research bulletin no 
 among others 
management uses a variety of factors to assess valuation depending on the asset 
for example  accounts receivable are evaluated based upon an aging schedule 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held 
property  plant and equipment  capitalized software and intangible and other assets are evaluated utilizing various factors  including the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  the cost of capital and customer demand 
investments are evaluated for impairment based upon market conditions and the viability of the investment 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could impact the value of the asset 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate that imposes a tax on income 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
new accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no

sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests 
table of contents method of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method 
sfas no 
eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life and addresses the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
as of july   the company had identified those intangible assets that remain separable under the provisions of sfas and those that are to be included in goodwill 
in applying sfas  the company completed the transitional intangible asset impairment test 
as a result  the company recognized an impairment charge to write off goodwill in the amount of million relating to its european business within its international business segment 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this statement also amends accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the company will adopt this statement in fiscal management believes that the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements will not be material 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues ask force consensus no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the company will adopt this statement in fiscal management believes that the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements will not be material 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this adoption resulted in an initial credit of 
million net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
this sab was intended to clarify certain elements of revenue recognition 
it has been supplemented by a frequently asked questions document 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
the consensus states that a seller of goods should classify fees attributable to shipping and handling in the income statement as revenues 
the company had previously netted such fees against shipping and handling costs in the cost of sales line 
in fiscal years and  approximately million and million  respectively  which previously would have reduced cost of sales  have been reclassified as revenues 
there was no effect on reported net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in fiscal year  approximately million  or  higher than the million provided in fiscal year this increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to working capital changes  primarily inventory reductions  being a source of cash in fiscal as compared to those changes being a use of cash in fiscal in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  from the million dollars provided in fiscal year 
table of contents due principally to a million decrease in net income and a million increase in non cash depreciation  amortization expense and asset impairments  million for exit costs and 
million in the amount of cash provided by working capital and other non cash adjustments to reported net income 
working capital as of june  amounted to million  including million of cash and short term investments 
this represents a decrease of million from the working capital balance of million  including cash and short term investments of million  at the end of fiscal year the decrease in working capital is primarily the result of inventory reductions in the apparel segment 
the company does not expect to experience any significant change to the amount of working capital investment required to support its business during fiscal year working capital increased in fiscal year by million  principally due to the effect of the premiumwear  inc acquisition in july capital expenditures of million in fiscal year represented an million decrease from the million expended in fiscal year and a million decrease from the million expended in fiscal year capital expenditures over the three year period have included significant investments in the purchase  development and implementation of information systems infrastructure  operating systems and the company s website and manufacturing related equipment 
capital expenditures in fiscal year included over million of investments in information systems and embroidery and distribution capacity for the company s acquired premiumwear business 
the company expects capital expenditures to approximate million in fiscal year  which will include additional planned improvements in information systems capabilities and investments to enhance manufacturing capability 
in august  the company acquired million shares of common stock of advantage payroll services  inc advantage for million 
combined with the company s purchase in march of million advantage common shares for million  the company had invested a total of million for million advantage common shares as of june  the company also holds a common stock purchase warrant  pursuant to which it has the right to purchase up to million advantage common shares  at a purchase price of per share subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the warrant 
in july  the company exercised the warrant in part and purchased 
million advantage common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as a result of the foregoing investments  the company owns million shares or approximately of the advantage common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis 
the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million in cash during fiscal year and  shares of the company s common stock for million in cash during fiscal year there were no repurchases of the company s common stock during fiscal year in addition  the company declared and paid cash dividends totaling 
per share during each of the last three fiscal years  amounting to a total of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of june  the company has authorization from its board to purchase up to an additional  shares of its stock 
in addition to its present cash and short term investment balances  the company has consistently generated sufficient cash internally to fund its needs for working capital  dividends and capital expenditures 
the company currently has a committed  unsecured  revolving credit agreement for million 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and specific consolidated debt and fixed charge ratios 
the company is in compliance with these covenants 
at june   the company had million outstanding under this arrangement 
in november  the company entered into a million note purchase agreement with the prudential insurance company of america 
under this agreement  the company will borrow at the eurodollar rate plus a 
table of contents spread for one year  after which the interest rate will be fixed at a rate of 
this agreement contains various restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and specific consolidated debt and fixed charge ratios 
the company is in compliance with these covenants 
at june   the company had million outstanding under this arrangement 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands of dollars total less than year years years thereafter contractual obligations payments due by period long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period lines of credit standby letter of credit commercial letters of credit total commercial commitments in order to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of the debt outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  the company has entered into six interest rate swap agreements with three of the banks party to the credit agreement 
these swap agreements contain notional principal amounts and other terms including rate of interest paid and received and maturity date determined with respect to the company s forecasts of future cash flows and borrowing requirements 
at june  the notional principal amount outstanding under the interest rate swap agreements totaled million 
for the fiscal year ended  a credit of approximately thousand was reclassified from other comprehensive income to earnings related to the ineffective portion of the company s swaps 
in fiscal year  there were no amounts transferred from other comprehensive income to earnings related to the company s swaps as the ineffective portion of the swaps was insignificant 
the company anticipates that its current cash on hand  cash flow from operations and additional availability under the lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for its operations and capital expenditures during fiscal year however  the company may pursue additional acquisitions from time to time  such as the acquisitions mentioned in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis  which would likely be funded through the use of available cash  issuance of stock  obtaining of additional credit  or any combination thereof 
certain factors that may affect future results references in this section to we  us and our refer to new england business service  inc we may make forward looking statements in this report and in other documents filed with the sec  in press releases  and in discussions with analysts  investors and others 
these statements include descriptions of our operational and strategic plans  expectations about our future sales and profits  views of conditions and trends in our markets  and other statements that include words like expects  estimates  anticipates  believes and intends  and which describe opinions about future events 

table of contents you should not rely on these forward looking statements as though they were guarantees 
these statements are based on our expectations at the time the statements are made  and we are not required to revise or update these statements based on future developments 
known and unknown risks may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these statements 
a majority of our sales and profits come from selling standardized business forms  checks and related products by mail order  telesales and direct sales to a target market consisting mainly of small businesses 
we believe that the critical success factors to compete in this market include competitive pricing  breadth of product offering  product quality and the ability to attract and retain a large number of individual customers 
these critical success factors are also applicable to the success of our packaging  shipping and warehouse supplies markets as well 
known material risks that may affect those critical success factors are described below 
a majority of the sales in our apparel business come from selling knit and woven sport shirts under labels licensed from third parties to the promotional products advertising specialty industry 
we believe that the critical success factors to compete in this market include product quality  timely fulfillment of customer orders and brand awareness 
known material risks that may affect those success factors are also described below 
our printed product lines face increased competition from various sources  such as office supply superstores 
increased competition may require us to reduce prices or offer other incentives in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers  which could reduce our profits 
low price  high volume office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms  checks and related products to small businesses 
because of their size  these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices 
these superstores also offer the convenience of one stop shopping for a broad array of office supplies that we do not offer 
in addition  national superstore competitors have greater financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts in order to seek or retain market share 
if any of these new competitors seek to gain or retain market share through price reductions or increased discounting  we may be forced to reduce our prices or match the discounts in order to stay competitive  which could reduce our profits 
technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over our smaller competitors  which could reduce our profits 
historically  our relatively greater financial strength and size have enabled us to offer a broader array of products  particularly those having a complex construction  at lower prices than the small local and regional dealers  distributors and printers who constitute our primary competition 
improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling these smaller competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs 
increased competition from local and regional competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers  which could reduce our profits 
because our sales growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new customers in our target small business market  economic events that adversely affect the small business economy may reduce our sales and profits 
average annual sales per customer of our core products have remained relatively stable over time 
as a result  we rely  in part  on continually attracting new customers for these products 
our sales and profits have been adversely affected by economic related contractions in the small business economy 
we expect that our sales and profits will continue to be affected by changes in the levels of small business formations and failures and from other economic events that affect the small business economy generally 

table of contents because our sales growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new customers in our target small business market  changes in the direct marketing industry that reduce our competitive advantage in contacting prospective customers may reduce our sales and profits 
growth in the total number of our direct mail customers depends on continued access to high quality lists of newly formed small businesses 
in the past  our ability to compile proprietary prospect lists was a distinct competitive advantage 
however  the external list compilation industry has become more sophisticated and comprehensive lists of new small business formations are now commercially available to our competitors 
in addition  the internet has the potential to eliminate our advantage of scale in direct marketing by providing all competitors  regardless of current size  with access to prospective customers 
we currently rely on the speed of our delivery of promotional materials to prospective customers to gain advantage over competitors 
we are also expanding our internet product offerings and capabilities and seeking to increase our visibility on the internet 
notwithstanding these efforts  a deterioration in our competitive advantage in contacting prospective customers could reduce our sales and profits 
in addition  the enactment of privacy laws could constrain our ability to obtain prospect lists or to telemarket to prospective customers 
declining response rates to the company s catalogs and other direct mail promotional materials could reduce our sales and profits 
our direct mail based businesses have recently experienced declines in the response rates to our catalogs and other direct mail promotional materials from both existing customers and prospects 
we believe that these declines are attributable to a number of factors  including current economic conditions  the overall increase in direct mail solicitations received by our target customers generally  and the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms products 
to the extent that we cannot compensate for reduced response rates through increases in average order value or improve response rates through new product introductions and improved direct mail contact strategies  our sales and profits may be adversely affected 
increases in the cost of paper and in postal rates adversely impact our costs  which we may be unable to offset by reducing costs in other areas or by raising prices 
the cost of paper to produce our products  catalogs and advertising materials makes up a significant portion of our total costs 
also  we rely on the us postal service to deliver most of our promotional materials 
prices for the various types of paper that we use have been volatile  and we expect them to continue to be so 
third class postal rates have generally increased over the past ten years  at times significantly 
we are not sure that we will always be able to reduce costs in other areas or to increase prices for our products sufficiently to offset increases in paper costs and postal rates 
if we are unable to offset these cost and expense increases  our profits will be adversely affected 
disruption in the services provided by certain of our critical vendors may adversely affect our operating performance and profits 
we use a limited number of vendors to provide key services to our business 
examples of this are as follows we use mci worldcom and qwest communications international to provide a majority of the toll free telephone lines for our direct marketing business  we use united parcel service to deliver most of the products that we ship to customers in the united states  we rely on the postal services of the countries in which we do business to deliver our catalogs and other advertising material to customers 

table of contents in the past  we have been adversely affected by disruption of some of these services due to labor actions  system failures  adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters 
if there are future interruptions in service from one or more of these vendors  we believe that there could be a significant disruption to our business due to our inability to readily find alternative service providers at comparable rates 
sales of our standardized forms products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences  which could reduce our sales and profits 
our standardized business forms  checks and related products provide our customers with financial and business records to manage their businesses 
continual technological improvements have provided our target customers in several market segments with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  the price and performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost competitive means to print low quality versions of our business forms on plain paper 
in addition  electronic transaction systems and off the shelf business software applications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by our business form products 
in response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business  we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full color products 
however  we have less of a cost advantage with these products than with standardized forms  due to improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology available to our smaller local and regional competitors 
we are also seeking to introduce new products and services that are less susceptible to technological obsolescence 
we may develop new products internally  procure them from third party vendors  or obtain them through the acquisition of a new business 
we generally realize lower gross margins on outsourced products than on products that we manufacture ourselves 
the risks associated with the acquisition of new businesses are described below 
if new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products  there is a risk that the number of new customers we attract and existing customers we retain may diminish  which could reduce our sales and profits 
decreases in sales of our historically high margin standardized business forms products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins 
this reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas 
we source our apparel products from offshore third party manufacturers 
difficulty in securing reliable sources for these products could adversely affect our ability to maintain inventory levels that are adequate to satisfy customer demand 
we purchase a majority of our apparel products from full package manufacturers outside the united states 
in most cases  these same manufacturers supply other apparel companies  many of which are significantly larger than our apparel business and are able  when necessary  to secure preferential treatment from the manufacturers 
the availability of product from these manufacturers can also be adversely affected by social  political and economic conditions in their respective regions 
any significant disruption in our relationships with our current manufacturers could adversely affect our apparel business to the extent we cannot readily find alternative sources of supply at comparable levels of price and quality 
inaccurate forecasting of the demand for specific apparel styles and sizes could reduce our sales and profits 
we believe that success in our apparel business depends in part on our ability to immediately ship ordered products  either directly or through our distributors 
given the relatively long lead time in procuring inventory  we must estimate demand for specific styles and sizes well in advance of receiving firm orders from customers in order to ensure the timely availability of these products 
inaccurate forecasting of demand for specific styles and sizes can result in either lost sales due to product unavailability  or reduced margins from liquidating overstocked items 

table of contents failure of our apparel licensors to adequately promote our licensed brands and protect those brands from infringement could reduce our sales and profits 
we believe that brand awareness is an important factor to the end user of our apparel products  and in that regard we market and sell a majority of our apparel products under nationally recognized brands licensed from third parties 
in each case  the licensor is primarily responsible for promoting its brand and protecting its brand from infringement 
the failure of one or more of our licensors to adequately promote or defend their brands could diminish the perceived value of those brands to our customers  which could lead to reduced sales and profits 
reductions in the number of apparel lines carried by wholesalers in the promotional products advertising specialty industry may adversely impact our sales and profits 
until recently  a significant portion of the sales in our apparel business have been to a relatively small number of wholesalers serving the promotional products advertising specialty market 
sales to these wholesalers have been recently decreasing  and have been partially offset by increases in direct sales to our advertising specialty dealers 
we believe that the wholesale apparel business serving this market is undergoing fundamental change  with wholesalers increasingly carrying only private label lines and branded lines on an exclusive basis 
we believe that these changes  together with current economic conditions  are likely to result in an accelerated decrease in our sales to wholesalers 
to the extent that increases in our direct sales to advertising specialty dealers  together with increases in our apparel sales to other markets  cannot keep pace with the erosion in our sales to wholesalers  sales and profits could be adversely impacted 
our growth strategy depends  in part  on the acquisition of complementary businesses that address our target small business market 
the acquisition of complementary businesses that address our target small business market has been important to our growth strategy 
we intend to continue this acquisition activity in the future 
the success of this activity depends on the following our ability to identify suitable businesses and to negotiate agreements on acceptable terms  our ability to obtain financing through additional borrowings  by issuing additional shares of common stock  or through internally generated cash flow  and our ability to achieve anticipated savings and growth and avoid disruption to our existing businesses 
in evaluating a potential acquisition  we conduct a business  financial and legal review of the target 
this review is intended to support our assumptions with respect to the projected future performance of the target and to identify the benefits and risks associated with those assumptions 
we cannot be certain that our review will identify all potential risks associated with the purchase  integration or operation of acquired businesses 
unanticipated risks may adversely affect the benefits that we expect to obtain from any given acquisition 
any write down of our investment in advantage payroll services  inc required under generally accepted accounting principles could reduce our reported earnings 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have invested a total of million for a minority investment in advantage payroll services  inc  a closely held payroll processing company 
this investment is currently reported on our balance sheet at our cost 
if  as a result of advantage s performance or other economic factors beyond our control  the value of this investment on our books exceeds the realizable value of the investment in the market  then we may be required under generally accepted accounting principles to write down the reported value of the investment  which could reduce our reported earnings for the period in which the write down occurs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a number of market risks  primarily due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investments in and loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  and their resultant operations  since they are denominated in foreign currencies  create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the company s utilization of its revolving credit agreement which carries a variable interest rate creates an exposure to changes in interest rates 
the effect  however  of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on the company s earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as business unit sales and operating margins 
this is because i foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of the company s total activity  the magnitude of foreign currency transactions has been minimal and forward foreign currency contracts have been historically entered into to hedge certain foreign exchange rate exposures  ii a significant portion of the company s borrowings are fixed through interest rate swaps 
in order to effectively convert the interest rate on a portion of the company s debt from a eurodollar based floating rate to a fixed rate  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with major commercial banks 
although the company is exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by any of the banks  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur 
the company does  however  have a component of its borrowings that is not hedged 
a upward movement in interest rates would impact earnings and cash flows by approximately 
million because of this unhedged position 
for more information on these market risks and financial exposures  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading  profit or speculative purposes 
upon reviewing its derivatives and other foreign currency and interest rate instruments  based on historical foreign currency rate movements and the fair value of market rate sensitive instruments at year end  the company does not believe that changes in foreign currency or interest rates will have a material impact on its near term earnings  fair values or cash flows
