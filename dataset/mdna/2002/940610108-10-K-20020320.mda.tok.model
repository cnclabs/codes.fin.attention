financial condition securities securities are designated as either available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
securities available for sale may be sold in response to changes in market conditions  prepayment risk  rate fluctuations  liquidity  or capital requirements 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
securities designated as held to maturity are part of the corporation s portfolio of long term interest earning assets 
these securities are classified as long term because the corporation has the intent and ability to hold them until maturity 
securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
provided that at the date of initial application an entity may transfer any security classified as held to maturity to available for sale or trading

the transition adjustment amounted to an unrealized loss  net of tax  of thousand and was reported in other comprehensive income 
securities available for sale the amortized cost of securities available for sale at december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the amount 
this increase was due primarily to purchases of mortgage backed securities 
at december   the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale amounted to million  an increase of million from the comparable amount 
this increase was attributable to the effects of reductions in medium and long term bond rates that occurred during see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail of unrealized gains and losses associated with securities available for sale

the gramm leach bliley act requires the fhlb to issue new capitalization requirements to be implemented by may loans total loans amounted to million at december   up million  or  from the december  amount of million 
the increase in total loans was led by growth in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
total residential real estate loans decreased million  or  in due to refinancings sold into the secondary market 
consumer loans were up million  or  in the increase in consumer loans was mainly due to growth in home equity lines

the corporation purchased million of boli in as a financing tool for employee benefits 
the corporation expects to benefit from the boli contracts as a result of the tax free growth in cash surrender value and death benefits that are expected to be generated over time 
the purchase of the life insurance policy results in an interest sensitive asset on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet that provides monthly tax free income to the corporation 
the largest risk to the boli program is credit risk of the insurance carriers 
to mitigate this risk  annual financial condition reviews are completed on all carriers

nonaccrual loans loans  with the exception of certain well secured residential mortgage loans  are placed on nonaccrual status and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are days or more past due with respect to principal and or interest 
well secured residential mortgage loans are permitted to remain on accrual status provided that full collection of principal and interest is assured 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
interest previously accrued  but uncollected  is reversed against current period income 
subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized as interest income  or recorded as a reduction of principal if full collection of the loan is doubtful or if impairment of the collateral is identified 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the obligation has performed in accordance with the contract terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectibility of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
there are no accruing loans days or more past due at december  included in accruing loans days or more past due at december  were residential mortgages amounting to thousand which were considered well collateralized and in the process of collection and therefore were deemed to have no loss exposure

these concessions include modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit the corporation by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  and  are loans whose terms have been restructured amounting to thousand and thousand  respectively 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure and other legal means  and loans determined to be substantively repossessed 
a loan is considered to be substantively repossessed when the corporation has taken possession of the collateral  but has not completed legal foreclosure proceedings 
oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
a valuation allowance is maintained for declines in market value and estimated selling costs 
the balance of oreo amounted to thousand at december   up from the prior year amount of thousand 
increases in oreo resulted from foreclosures and repossessions that exceeded the level of sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets 
during  proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets amounted to thousand 
washington trust occasionally provides financing to facilitate the sales of some of these properties 
financing is generally provided at market rates with credit terms similar to those available to other borrowers 
allowance for loan losses the corporation uses a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient allowance for loan losses all 
the methodology includes three elements identification of specific loan losses  general loss allocations for certain loan types based on credit grade and loss experience factors  and general loss allocations for other environmental factors 
the methodology includes an analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired in accordance with the terms of sfas other individual commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans are evaluated using an internal rating system and the application of loss allocation factors 
the loan rating system and the related loss allocation factors take into consideration the borrower s financial condition  the borrower s performance with respect to loan terms and the adequacy of collateral 
portfolios of more homogenous populations of loans including residential mortgages and consumer loans are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency ratios and other indicators  the corporation s historical loss experience and comparison to industry standards of loss allocation factors for each type of credit product 
finally  an additional unallocated allowance is maintained based on a judgmental process whereby management considers qualitative and quantitative assessments of other environmental factors 
for example  most of the loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in southern rhode island and southeastern connecticut and a substantial portion of the portfolio is collateralized by real estate in this area  including most consumer loans and those commercial loans not specifically classified as commercial mortgages 
a portion of the commercial and commercial mortgage loans are to borrowers in the hospitality and tourism industry and this concentration has been increasing in recent years 
economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements are considered including interest rates and energy costs 
results of regulatory examinations  historical loss ranges  portfolio composition including a trend toward somewhat larger credit relationships  and other changes in the portfolio are also considered 
the allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and is reduced by charge offs on loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is one of the major market risks faced by the corporation 
the alco is responsible for establishing policy guidelines on liquidity and acceptable exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results which are consistent with washington trust s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco manages the corporation s interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month period 
the simulations assume that the size and general composition of the corporation s balance sheet remain constant over the month simulation horizon and take into account the specific repricing  maturity  call options  and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
non contractual savings deposits are classified as short term three months or less for both maturity and repricing purposes 
the characteristics of financial instrument classes are reviewed periodically by the alco to ensure their accuracy and consistency 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the negative exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
in addition  the alco reviews month horizon results to assess longer term risk inherent in the balance sheet 
as of december  and december   net interest income simulation indicated exposure to changing interest rates over a month horizon to a degree that remained within tolerance levels established by the corporation 
the corporation defines maximum unfavorable net interest income exposure to be a change of no more than in net interest income over the first months and no more than over the second months of the simulation horizon 
the following table summarizes the effect that interest rate shifts would have on net interest income for a month period using the corporation s on and off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  interest rates are assumed to shift by a parallel basis points upward or basis points downward over a month period  except for core savings deposits  which are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their historical insensitivity to rate changes 
further  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
the asymmetric rate shift scenarios presented below reflect the fact that given the low level of interest rates at december   a parallel rate decline of basis points is extremely unlikely to occur  as this would effectively reduce many interest rates to zero 
it should be noted that the rate scenarios used do not necessarily reflect the alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the next months 
furthermore  since a static balance sheet is assumed  the results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the corporation for the same period 
the following table presents these month net interest income simulation results dollars in thousands flat falling rising rates rates rates interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage backed securities    adjustable rate mortgage backed securities    callable securities    other securities    fixed rate mortgages    adjustable rate mortgages    other fixed rate loans    other adjustable rate loans    interest rate floor contracts total interest income    interest bearing liabilities core savings deposits    time deposits    fhlb advances    other borrowings total interest expense    net interest income results as of december     net interest income results as of december     the alco estimates that the negative exposure of net interest income to falling rates results from the difficulty of reducing rates paid on core savings deposits given the current level of interest rates 
if rates were to fall and remain low for a sustained period  core savings deposit rates might not be reduced much below current levels  while rates earned on assets would decline as current assets mature or reprice 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk since the repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments  especially core savings deposits  may change to a different degree than estimated 
in addition  since income simulations assume that the corporation s balance sheet will remain static over the month simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in changing interest rate environments 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure which may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to the corporation s capital position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
the following table summarizes the potential change in market value of the corporation s available for sale debt securities as of december  and resulting from immediate basis point parallel rate shifts dollars in thousands falling rising security type rates rates us treasury and government sponsored agency securities noncallable  us government sponsored agency securities callable corporate securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities   fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations  total change in market value as of december    total change in market value as of december    the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities using value at risk analysis 
the anticipated maximum market value reduction for the bank s available for sale securities portfolio at december   including both debt and equity securities  was  assuming a one year time horizon and a probability of occurrence for value at risk analysis 
at december   gap analysis showed that the corporation s cumulative one year gap was a negative million  or of earning assets 
the following table details the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods presented 
to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
fixed rate mortgages  mortgage backed securities and consumer installment loans have been allocated based on expected amortization and prepayment rates using assumptions based on recent historical performance 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are presented in the under three month category 
management believes that gap analysis has substantial limitations as a measure of interest rate risk  as it does not address the effect of changes in interest rates nor the magnitude of resulting changes in net interest income 
for this reason  the alco does not use gap analysis to establish interest rate risk targets or assess interest rate risk exposure 
the following table summarizes the corporation s gap analysis as of december  dollars in thousands months to months to over or less months to year years years interest earning assets loans      debt securities      other   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits     fhlb advances      other borrowings  total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap per period      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      on occasion  the corporation has supplemented its interest rate risk management strategies with off balance sheet transactions 
such transactions are intended to hedge specifically identified risks inherent in the corporation s balance sheet  and not to produce speculative profits 
the corporation has written policy guidelines that designate limits on the notional value of off balance sheet transactions and require periodic evaluation of risks associated with these transactions  including counterparty credit risk 
during  the corporation entered into an interest rate floor contract with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in february this contract is intended to function as a hedge against reductions in interest income realized from prime based loans 
the corporation receives payment for this contract if certain interest rates fall below specified levels 
effective january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 the corporation recognized the fair value of this derivative  amounting to thousand  as an asset on the balance sheet 
at december   the carrying value of the interest rate floor contract amounted to thousand and is reported in other assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the floor contract
