liquidity and capital resources we finance our business through cash flows from operations and the issuance of debt and equity 
one of our primary financial goals is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity through active management of assets and liabilities 
during the twelve months ended june   we generated approximately million in cash flow from operations versus the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
free cash flow  defined as cash provided used by operating activities less property  equipment and purchased software additions  was approximately million for fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year fiscal year cash flow from operations was adversely impacted by the payments of approximately million in income taxes related to the net gain from our divestiture activity in june and approximately million of non recurring lease termination charges 
after adjusting for these items  cash flow from operations and free cash flow 
table of contents increased and  respectively 
during fiscal year versus fiscal year  our operating cash flow was enhanced by current year net income that increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  a increase 
during the fiscal year  we used billion in investing activities 
investing activities included the purchase of property  equipment and software  net  which increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year our capital expenditures remain at less than of total revenues  which we believe is adequate to support our growing business and to meet contractual requirements 
we expended over billion in cash for acquisitions  primarily for ims and npc in august approximately million and million  respectively  plus related transaction costs  andersen in may approximately million plus related transaction costs  and afsa in june approximately million plus related transaction costs 
during fiscal year  approximately billion was provided by financing activities 
we financed the ims acquisition through a combination of a million month interim credit facility  available cash on hand  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
this interim credit facility was repaid in october with proceeds from an equity offering of million shares of our class a common stock at per share  that raised million  net of transaction costs 
we used borrowings under our existing credit facility to purchase npc and existing cash on hand to purchase andersen 
we secured interim financing in the amount of million for the afsa acquisition that was supplemented by our revolving credit facility and cash on hand 
in september  we entered into a new three and one half year million credit facility on terms generally similar to our existing credit facility  which was partially used to refinance the afsa interim facility 
on march   all the outstanding notes million were converted to class a common stock 
as the result of such conversions  million shares of our class a common stock were issued to shareholders 
this relieved the company of approximately million in interest expense for fiscal year related to the notes 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we completed the issuance of million of our notes  which allowed us to repay borrowings from our existing credit facility and to fund current and future acquisitions 
at june   we had million of availability under our million revolving credit facility  after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit of million that secure certain contractual performance and other obligations 
these letters of credit reduce the availability of our revolving credit facility 
we had million outstanding on our credit facility  which is reflected in long term debt 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million compared to million at june  the decrease is primarily due to the use of cash for the ims acquisition and other acquisitions 
included in the cash balances at june  and  are million and million  respectively  of restricted cash held on behalf of government clients 
working capital decreased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents to fund acquisitions 
our current ratio  defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  was and  and our debt to capitalization ratio was and at june  and  respectively 
certain of our state and local government contracts require we execute surety bonds or letters of credit to ensure that the project is administered and completed as provided for in the contract 
prior to september and the well documented bankruptcies of several large companies eg enron  kmart  and worldcom  surety bonds were obtainable on relatively favorable terms at minimal pricing 
in late  the market for surety bonds changed dramatically with capacity tightening and prices increasing 
the long term outlook of the surety market  while improving  remains unclear 
as of june   we have outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit of million and million  respectively  to secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients 
notwithstanding the existing condition of the surety bond market  management believes that we have sufficient liquidity from our cash flow and under our revolving credit facility to meet ongoing business needs and to respond to future requests for proposals from state and local governments 

table of contents as of june   we held a minority preferred stock interest in ddh aviation  inc ddh  a corporate airplane brokerage company organized in ddh has a million line of credit with citicorp usa  inc  for which we and our chairman  in exchange for warrants to acquire additional voting stock  acted as guarantors 
in addition  we obtained access to aircraft at favorable rates in consideration of our guaranty 
acs guaranteed up to million of the line of credit  and our chairman guaranteed up to million of the line of credit 
subsequent to june   our chairman assumed in full acs guaranty obligations to citicorp  and our guaranty to citicorp was released in full at no cost to us 
we have no further contingent liability related to ddh indebtedness 
our management believes that available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth needs  including working capital expenditures 
our management also believes that cash provided by operations will be sufficient to satisfy all existing debt obligations as they become due 
however  we intend to continue our growth through acquisitions and from time to time to engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition and expansion opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
related party transactions in august  we purchased a challenger aircraft from ddh for a purchase price of million  which included interior and exterior refurbishment of the aircraft 
as of june   the purchase price for the aircraft was paid in full  and refurbishment was near completion

table of contents assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
during fiscal year  we adopted staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
generally  information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are normally determined on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
in the federal government segment  our contracts are typically cost reimbursable  fixed price  unit price  or time and material contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  which requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between acs and our customers in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the customer s specifications 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive payment depends on our performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the long term nature of these contracts  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the contract include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of delayed performance  and availability and timing of funding from the client 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
during the fiscal year ended june   less than of our revenues were derived from percentage of completion contracts 
revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
immediate recognition is made of any anticipated losses 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 

table of contents the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
for the ims  andersen  and afsa acquisitions in  we obtained a third party valuation of the intangible assets 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which changes the rules for how companies must account for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
costs typically associated with exit or disposal activities include one time employee termination costs  contract cancellation provisions  and relocation costs 
sfas nullifies eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of the new standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our future earnings and financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  sfas rescinds both statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and the amendment to sfas  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
through this rescission  sfas eliminates the requirement in both sfas and sfas that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
generally  sfas is effective for transactions occurring after may  we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our future earnings and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of existing generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the recognition and measurement of long lived asset impairment contained in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas no 
provides new guidance intended to address certain significant implementation issues associated with sfas  including expanded guidance with respect to appropriate cash flows to be used to determine whether recognition of any long lived asset impairment is required and if required  how to measure the amount of the impairment 
sfas also requires that any net assets to be disposed of by sale be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less cost to sell  and expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include any component of an entity with operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our future earnings and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas discontinues amortization of acquired goodwill and instead requires annual impairment testing of acquired goodwill 
intangible assets will be amortized over their useful economic life and tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life should not be amortized until the life of the asset is determined to be finite 
we adopted sfas effective july  sfas has had 
table of contents a significant favorable impact on our fiscal year financial results through the elimination of goodwill amortization 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of sfas also in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method and defines the criteria for identifying intangible assets for recognition apart from goodwill 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the acquisition date is july  or later 
we have adopted sfas effective july  we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our future earnings or financial position 
risks related to our business the risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all inclusive 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and as a result  the trading price of our class a common stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
loss of  or reduction of business from  significant clients 
the loss of clients and or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our clients could materially affect our profitability and cash flows 
in addition  we incur a high level of fixed costs related to our technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing clients  therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flow 
termination of a contract by a client or deterioration of the financial condition of a client 
we must make significant capital investments in order to attract and retain large outsourcing agreements 
the termination of a client contract or the deterioration of the financial condition or prospects of a client has in the past  and may in the future  result in an impairment of the net book value of the assets recorded and a reduction in our earnings 
competition 
we expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter our existing markets 
if we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services decreases  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected 
many of our competitors have greater resources  and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  we must frequently compete with a client s own internal business process and information technology capabilities  which may constitute a fixed cost for the client 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
without additional acquisitions  we are unlikely to maintain historical growth rates 
rapid technological changes 
the markets for our information technology services are subject to rapid technological changes and rapid changes in client requirements 
we may be unable to timely and successfully customize products and services that incorporate new technology or to deliver the services and products demanded by the marketplace 
loss of significant software vendor relationships 
our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors 
if our significant software vendors were to terminate or refuse to renew our contracts with them  we might not be able to 
table of contents replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
exercise of commercial contract termination provisions 
some of our commercial contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not consistent with service levels specified in those contracts  or provide for credits to our clients for failure to meet service levels 
in addition  if clients are not satisfied with our level of performance  our reputation in the industry may suffer  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
exercise by government clients of termination rights 
approximately of our fiscal revenues were derived from contracts with the united states government and its agencies  and approximately of our fiscal revenues were derived from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
governments may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies 
if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract  the costs are not reimbursable or  if already reimbursed  the cost must be refunded to the government 
budget deficits at state and local governments and their agencies 
approximately of our revenues in fiscal year were derived from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
currently  many state and local governments that we have contracts with are facing potential budget deficits 
while this has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through fiscal  it is unclear what impact  if any  these deficits may have on our future results of operations 
inability to provide contract performance guarantees 
certain of our state and local government contracts require we execute surety bonds or letters of credit to ensure that the project is administered and completed as provided for in the contract 
prior to september and the well documented bankruptcies of several large companies eg enron  kmart  and worldcom  surety bonds were obtainable on relatively favorable terms at minimal pricing 
in late  the market for surety bonds changed dramatically with capacity tightening and prices increasing 
in certain situations  we have found it more economical to satisfy our obligations under certain state and local contracts with letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 
the long term outlook of the surety market  while improving  remains unclear 
we may not have enough capacity under our revolving credit facility to continue doing this in the future  and therefore  profitability under our existing contracts may deteriorate  and we may not be able to bid on state and local contracts in the future 
terrorist attacks 
terrorist attacks and further acts of violence or war may cause major instability in the us and other financial markets in which we operate 
in addition  armed hostilities and further acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  central america  south america  europe  africa  australia  and the middle east  or those of our clients 
these developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to attract and retain necessary technical personnel and skilled management 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel 
if we fail to attract  train  and retain  sufficient numbers of these technically skilled people  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our success also depends on the skills  experience  and performance of key members of our management team 
the loss of any key employee could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations and prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments 
our variable rate debt instruments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
during the first half of fiscal year  in order to manage interest costs and exposure to changing interest rates related to our million revolving line of credit  we held two interest rate hedges initiated in december these hedges expired in december each hedge was designated a cash flow hedge and was structured such that we paid a fixed rate of interest of on amounts owed under the revolving 
table of contents line of credit up to the notional amount  and received a floating rate of interest based on one month libor 
the notional amount of the two hedges totaled million and expired in december changes in the fair value of the interest rate hedges  net of tax effect  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we held a single investment in a marketable security during fiscal year to protect ourselves from the volatility of the value of this marketable security investment  we entered into a no cost collar agreement in june  which matured in june the collar  a fair value hedge  is structured so that all fluctuations in the price of the marketable security above or below or of its value on the date the collar was entered into are hedged 
this marketable security investment was liquidated as of june   and the related collar was terminated 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivative transactions 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in the interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair value  or cash flows
