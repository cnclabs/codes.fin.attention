the class b notes bear interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus percent per annum and amortize on a monthly basis by an amount which varied based on excess cash flows received from receivables acquired for investment after payment of servicing fees  trustee and back up servicer fees  class a note interest and class a note principal  plus collections received on the trust certificates 
the outstanding balance of the class a notes was  as of april  and had a weighted average interest rate of percent  including the effects of program fees and hedge instruments 
the class b notes were paid in full on september  after the class b notes were paid in full  all cash flows received after payment of class a note principal and interest  servicing fees and other costs  are distributed to the partnership for subsequent distribution to the partners based upon the respective partnership interests 
during fiscal   was distributed to the limited partner compared to  for fiscal the amount of the partners cash flow will vary depending on the timing and amount of residual cash flows 
beginning in november  the partnership used excess cash flow to retire additional class a note principal thus no further partnership distributions will be paid until the class a notes are retired 
the company is accounting for first union s limited partnership interest in the partnership as a minority interest 
the class a notes mature on march  if the class a notes are not renewed on or prior to the maturity date  the outstanding balance under the notes would continue to amortize utilizing cash collections from the receivables pledged as collateral 
the company presently intends to seek a renewal of the notes from the lender prior to maturity 
management considers its relationship with the lender to be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that the notes will not be renewed 
if the notes were not renewed  however  or if material changes were made to the terms and conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
working capital facility 
the company has maintained a million working capital line of credit with bank of america and first union national bank that was utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the facility was increased from million to million in december and was scheduled to mature on december  effective december   the million in outstandings were refinanced through the issuance of a million term loan 
under the terms of the facility  provided by bank of america and first union  the term loan would be repaid in quarterly installments of  beginning on march  in addition to the scheduled principal payments  the term loan also required additional principal payments of  in june and december under certain conditions relating to the size of bank of america s portion of the outstanding balance 
the remaining unpaid balance of the term loan was due at maturity on december  pricing under the facility was based on the libor rate plus percent 
the term loan was secured by all unencumbered assets of the company  excluding receivables owned and financed by wholly owned  special purpose subsidiaries of the company and is guaranteed by first investors financial services group  inc and all subsidiaries that are not special purpose subsidiaries 
in consideration for refinancing the working capital facility  the company paid each lender an upfront fee and issued warrants to each lender to purchase  in aggregate   shares of the company s common stock at a strike price of per share 
the warrants expire on december  on december   the warrant value of  was estimated based on the expected difference between financing costs with and without the warrants 
these costs were included as deferred financing costs and were to be amortized through the maturity date of the debt 
in addition  if certain conditions were met  the company agreed to issue additional warrants to bank of america to acquire up to a maximum of  additional shares of stock at a price equal to the average closing price for the immediately preceding trading days prior to each grant date which is june  and december  pursuant to this requirement  the company issued  warrants to bank of america at a strike price of per share on june  all other terms and conditions of the warrants were identical to the warrants issued in december the amount of warrants  if any  to be issued on december  was to be determined by the outstanding balance owed to bank of america under the term loan 
in no event  however  could the additional warrants issued on december  exceed  the fair value of the warrants issued on june  of  is included as deferred financing costs and amortized through the maturity date of the debt 
at april   there was  outstanding under this facility 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with first union national bank to refinance the  outstanding balance of the working capital term loan and increase the size of the facility to million 
the renewal facility was provided to a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  first investors residual funding lp 
upon the issuance of the a term notes on january   a portion of this facility was converted to a million term loan tranche which amortizes monthly as principal payments are collected under the a term note facility 
the monthly principal amortization must be sufficient to reduce the amounts outstanding under the term loan tranche of this facility to no greater than percent of the outstanding receivables securing the a term note transaction 
the term loan tranche of this working capital facility will be evidenced by the class b notes issued in conjunction with the auto trust financing 
this principal repayment requirement replaces the current  per quarter and the additional  per annum required under the previous facility 
the remaining million of the million working capital facility revolves monthly in accordance with a borrowing base consisting of the overcollateralization amount and reserve accounts for each of the company s other credit facilities 
the new facility is secured solely by the residual cash flow and cash reserve accounts related to the company s warehouse credit facilities  the acquisition facility and the existing and future term note facilities 
this compares to the previous requirement that all assets of the company  excluding receivables owned and financed by special purpose subsidiaries  secure the indebtedness 
pricing under the facility was not changed 
the maturity of the facility was extended to december  in the event that the facility is not renewed at maturity  residual cash flows from the various receivables financing transactions will be applied to amortize the debt over the remaining life of the underlying receivables 
further  as a result of the refinancing  the company is not obligated to issue additional warrants covering  shares of the company s common stock to bank of america on december  at april   there was  outstanding under this facility 
in conjunction with the refinancing  the company repaid the working capital term loan and entered into the new working capital facility 
consequently   of deferred financing costs and warrants were written off 
the company presently intends to seek a renewal of the working capital facility from its lender prior to maturity 
should the facility not be renewed  the outstanding balance of the receivables would be amortized in accordance with the borrowing base 
management considers its relationship with its lenders to be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not be renewed 
if the facility were not renewed  however  or if material changes were made to its terms and conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
shareholder loans on december  the company entered into an agreement with one of its existing shareholders and a member of its board of directors under which the company may  from time to time  borrow up to million 
the proceeds of the borrowings will be utilized to fund certain private and open market purchases of the company s common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a fixed rate of percent per annum 
the facility is unsecured and expressly subordinated to the company s senior credit facilities 
the facility matures on december  but may be repaid at any time unless the company is in default on one of its other credit facilities 
as of april    was outstanding under this facility 
interest rate management 
the company s warehouse credit facilities bear interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short term basis while the secured term notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest 
the company s receivables bear interest at fixed rates that do not generally vary changes in market interest rates 
since a primary contributor to the company s profitability is its ability to manage its net interest spread  the company seeks to maximize the net interest spread while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
in connection with managing the net interest spread  the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps or caps to minimize the effects of market interest rate fluctuations on the net interest spread 
to the extent that the company has outstanding floating rate borrowings or has elected to convert a portion of its borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates  the company will be exposed to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
in connection with the issuance of the a term notes  the company entered into a swap agreement with bank of america pursuant to which the company pays a floating rate equal to the prevailing one month libor rate plus percent and receives a fixed rate of percent from the counterparty 
the initial notional amount of the swap was  which amortizes in accordance with the expected amortization of the term notes 
final maturity of the swap was august  on september   the company elected to terminate the floating swap at no material gain or loss and enter into a new swap under which the company would pay a fixed rate of percent on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the swap  the counterparty had the option of extending the swap for an additional three years to mature on april  at a fixed rate of percent 
on april   the counterparty exercised its extension option 
on june   the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and a maturity date of april  under the terms of these swaps  the company will pay a floating rate based on one month libor and receive a fixed rate of percent 
management elected to enter into these swap agreements to offset the uneconomic position of the existing fixed swap created by rapidly declining market interest rates 
in connection with the repurchase of the alac securitization and the financing of that repurchase through the fiacc subsidiary on september   fiacc entered into an interest rate swap agreement with first union under which fiacc pays a fixed rate of percent as compared to the one month commercial paper index rate 
the initial notional amount of the swap is  which amortizes monthly in accordance with the expected amortization of the fiacc borrowings 
the final maturity of the swap was december  on march   in connection with the repurchase of the alac securitization and the financing of that purchase through the fiacc subsidiary  the company and the counterparty modified the existing interest rate swap increasing the notional amount initially to  and reducing the fixed rate from percent to percent 
the new notional amount is scheduled to amortize monthly in accordance with the expected principal amortization of the underlying borrowings 
the expiration date of the swap was changed from december  to september  on october   in connection with the million acquisition facility  the company  through fifs acquisition  entered into a series of hedging instruments with first union national bank designed to hedge floating rate borrowings under the acquisition facility against changes in market rates 
accordingly  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  the first in the initial notional amount of million swap a pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at percent  and  the second in the initial notional amount of million swap b pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at percent 
the notional amount outstanding under each swap agreement amortizes based on an implied amortization of the hedged indebtedness 
swap a has a final maturity of december  while swap b matured on february  the company also purchased two interest rate caps  which protect the company  and the lender against any material increases in interest rates  which may adversely affect any outstanding indebtedness that is not fully covered by the aggregate notional amount outstanding under the swaps 
the first cap agreement class a cap enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds percent on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap a and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires december  and the cost of the cap is amortized in interest expense for the period 
the second cap agreement class b cap enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds percent on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap b and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires december  and the cost of the cap is imbedded in the fixed rate applicable to swap b 
pursuant to the refinance of the acquisition facility on august   the class b cap was terminated and the notional amounts of the swap a and class a cap were adjusted downward to reflect the lower outstanding balance of the class a notes 
the amendment or cancellation of these instruments resulted in a gain of  this derivative net gain is being amortized over the life of the initial derivative instrument 
in addition  the two remaining hedge instruments were assigned by fifs acquisition to the partnership 
as of may  the company had designated the three interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap with an aggregate notional value of  as cash flow hedges as defined under sfas no 
accordingly  any changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the mark to market process are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity through other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the decision to enter into the million floating rate swaps on june   the company elected to change the designation of the million fixed rate swap and not account for the instrument as a hedge under sfas no 
as a result  the change in fair value of both swaps is reflected in net earnings for the period subsequent to may  in conjunction with this designation and the adoption of sfas and sfas  the company recorded a transition adjustment in the aggregate amount of  net of a tax benefit of  as a reduction to shareholders equity and recorded a corresponding liability to reflect the fair market value of the derivatives as of may  the equity adjustment is classified as other comprehensive income loss and the derivative liability is classified in the interest rate derivative positions liability 
over a period ending april  the maturity date of the final swap  the company will reclassify into earnings substantially all of the transition adjustment originally recorded 
delinquency and credit loss experience the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by nonperforming receivables 
the company seeks to manage its risk of credit loss through i prudent credit evaluations  ii risk management activities  iii effective collection procedures  and iv by maximizing recoveries on defaulted loans 
an allowance for credit losses of  as of april  and  as of april  as a percentage of the receivables held for investment of  as of april  and  as of april  was percent 
with respect to receivables acquired for investment  the company has established a nonaccretable loss reserve to cover expected losses over the remaining life of the receivables 
as of april  and april   the nonaccretable loss reserve as a percentage of receivables acquired for investment was and  respectively 
the nonaccretable portion represents the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and interest payments over its expected cash flows 
the increase as of april  is related to additional reserve provided by the third quarter write down of million related to increasing the cumulative loss rate in the cash flow projections 
this write down occurred due to higher severity and frequency of losses realized to date and to reserve for potential losses based on the higher loss curve expected 
the company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest 
accrual of interest is suspended when the payment from the borrower is over days past due 
generally  repossession procedures are initiated to days after the payment default 
the company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables acquired 
the company purchases credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
until march  such insurance absorbed substantially all credit losses 
in april  the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter 
in addition  receivables financed under the a auto trust  a auto trust  fiarc and fiacc commercial paper facilities do not carry default insurance 
provisions for credit losses of  and  have been recorded for the twelve months ended april  and april   respectively 
the company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas  accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan does not apply to the company since the receivables held for investment are comprised of a large group of smaller balance homogenous loans 
the company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of the allowance for credit losses 
the specific methodology utilized is a six month migration analysis whereby the company compares the aging status of each loan from six months prior to the aging loan status as of the reporting date 
these factors are then applied to the aging status of each loan at the reporting date in order to calculate the number of loans that are expected to migrate to impaired status 
the estimated number of impairments is then multiplied by estimated loss per loan  which is based on historical information 
the computed reserve is then compared to the amount recorded for adequacy 
the company compares the six month result to prior six month periods to compare trends and evaluate any other internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
for receivables acquired for investment  nonaccretable difference represents contractual principal and interest payments the company will be unable to collect 
the company analyzes the composition of these liquidating portfolios in order to estimate a future loss rate 
criteria evaluated include delinquencies  historical charge offs  recovery rates  portfolio seasoning and economic conditions 
a cash flow model that considers term  interest rate  loss rate  prepayment rate and recovery rate is consistently applied to project expected cash flows 
the difference between expected cash flows and total contractual principal and interest payments is the nonaccretable difference 
during the third quarter of the year ended april   the company increased the cumulative loss rates on the warehouse and fiacc portfolios by and  respectively 
the total increase to nonaccretable difference of  relates to the recessionary environment and the impact it has on customers ability to maintain comparable paying employment 
additionally  the effective decrease in prices of new automobiles through incentive programs offered by captives contributed to decreasing prices and demands for used vehicles 
this results in lower recovery rates realized through repossessions 
the collateral comprising the receivables acquired for investment is at higher risk as it is primarily older model used cars with higher mileage 
the increase in accretable yield results from increasing the expected term of the remaining cash flow in order to allow for collections on charged off receivables 
by extending the cash flow projection model life  accretable yield must be increased to provide for future income 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s delinquency and charge off experience over its last two fiscal years dollars in thousands as of or for the year ended april  number number of loans amount of loans amount receivables held for investment delinquent amount outstanding days   days   days or more   total delinquencies   total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding during the period the total number of delinquent accounts days or more as a percentage of the number of outstanding receivables for the company s portfolio of receivables acquired for investment and securitized receivables was percent and percent as of april   and  respectively 
market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix  developments in the financial markets  and further utilization by the company of risk mitigating strategies such as hedging 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates which are reset on a short term basis  whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
the company is therefore exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates on its credit facilities 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate increases on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company relies almost exclusively on revolving credit facilities to fund its origination of receivables 
periodically  the company will transfer receivables from a revolving to a term credit facility 
currently all of the company s credit facilities in combination with various swaps bear interest at floating rates tied to either a commercial paper index or libor 
as of april   the company had million of floating rate secured debt outstanding considering the effect of swap and cap agreements 
for every percent increase in commercial paper rates or libor  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates
