other operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and was million for the year ended december  the increase in other operating income in compared to is the direct result of the increase in sales of sba and mortgage loans

the sales of sba a  and mortgage loans generated net gains on sale of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  there were no sales of sba a loans during the increase in sales of sba loans in is the result of the company reaching its desired mix of sba loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding 
the company s strategic plan calls for limitations in the concentration of sba loans to total loans outstanding 
sba loans are therefore now being sold in order to keep the concentration below the established limit set by the board of directors 
loan servicing fees  net  decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the company and the industry experienced a significant increase in prepayments during the years ended december  and december   compared to prior years  which resulted in a write downs of  and  of the servicing asset  respectively

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans  other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets 
nonperforming loans are those loans which have i been placed on nonaccrual status  ii been subject to troubled debt restructurings  iii been classified as doubtful under the company s asset classification system  or iv become contractually past due days or more with respect to principal or interest and have not been restructured or otherwise placed on nonaccrual status

nonaccrual loans are impaired loans where the original contractual amount may not be fully collectible 
the company measures its impaired loans by using the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate if the loan is not collateral dependent 
as of december   and  all impaired or nonaccrual loans were collateral dependent 
the company places loans on nonaccrual status that are delinquent days or more or when a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest and principal 
as of december   the company had twelve loans on nonaccrual status  totaling  of this total   or  was guaranteed by the government 
as of december   the company had five loans on nonaccrual status  totaling  of this total   or  was guaranteed by the government 
the company had eight loans on nonaccrual status as of december   totaling  of this total  or  was guaranteed by the government 
interest income that would have been recorded on loans on nonaccrual status  under the original terms of such loans  would have totaled  for the year ended december    for and  for in addition to the loans disclosed above as nonaccrual or restructured  management has also identified approximately million in loans that  on the basis of information known to us  were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
management cannot  however  predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors may impact our borrowers and our loan portfolio 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  become restructured loans  or other real estate owned or repossessed assets in the future 
certain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles spv to dispose of problem assets 
a spv is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt 
under certain circumstances  these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and nonperforming assets 
we do not use those vehicles  or any other accounting structures  to dispose of problem assets 
classified assets 
from time to time  management has reason to believe that certain borrowers may not be able to repay their loans within the parameters of the present repayment terms  even though  in some cases  the loans are current at the time 
these loans are graded in the classified loan grades of substandard  doubtful  or loss and include non performing loans 
each classified loan is monitored monthly 
classified assets consisting of nonaccrual loans  loans graded as substandard or lower and reo at december  and were million and million  respectively 
risk management 
the investment of the company s funds is primarily in loans where a greater degree of risk is normally assumed than in other forms of investments 
sound underwriting of loans and continuing evaluations of the underlying collateral and performance of the borrowers are an integral part in the maintenance of a high level of quality in the total assets of the company 
net loan charge offs for the year ended december  were  or of average gross loans outstanding  compared to  or of average gross loans outstanding  for the year ended december  the increase in loan charge offs is reflective of the recession which began in allowance for loan losses 
the company has established a methodology for the determination of provisions for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for an overall allowance for loan losses as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual loans 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance and a specific allowance for identified problem loans 
in originating loans  the company recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against earnings and reduced by net loan chargeoffs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  or partially charged off when portions of a loan are deemed to be uncollectible 
recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the responsibility for the review of the company s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the general valuation allowance lies with the director s loan committee 
this committee assigns the loss reserve ratio for each type of asset and reviews the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly based on an evaluation of the portfolio  past experience  prevailing market conditions  amount of government guarantees  concentration in loan types and other relevant factors 
specific valuation allowances are established to absorb losses on loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured as prescribed in sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 

the amount of the specific allowance is based on the estimated valued of the collateral securing the loans and other analyses pertinent to each situation 
estimates of identifiable losses are reviewed continually and  generally  a provision for losses is charged against operations on a monthly basis as necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
management presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the directors loan committee meets quarterly to review and monitor conditions in the portfolio and to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
to the extent that any of these conditions are evidenced by identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  the committee s estimate of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the bank is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the most recent information that has become available 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates and for the periods indicated at or for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period chargeoffs real estate loans one to four family commercial consumer total chargeoffs recoveries real estate loans one to four family commercial consumer total recoveries net chargeoffs reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs to average loans reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit as of december  the balance in the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million as of december  in addition  the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit was increased to  as of december   compared to  as of december  and was  as of december  the balance of undisbursed construction and other loans was million as of december   compared to million as of december   and was million as of december  as of december  the allowance was of total gross loans compared to as of december  and as of december  including the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit  the allowance was of total gross loans as of december   compared to as of december   and was as of december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was as of december   compared to  as of december  and was as of december  the allowance for loan losses  including reserves for losses on commitments to extend credit  to nonperforming loans  net of government guarantees was as of december   compared to  as of december  and as of december  the reason for the large fluctuation between years is partly due to the small amount of nonaccrual loans used in the calculation for during the year ended december  management charged off  net of recoveries to the allowance while it provided  to the provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december  management charged off  net of recoveries and provided  to the provision for loan losses 
for the year ended december   net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  management believes the allowance at december  is adequate based upon its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss trends and other factors 
although management believes that they use the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
nonaccrual loans  net of the government guaranteed portion  increased to million or of total gross loans as of december  compared to  or of total loans as of december  as of december  and  the company had no other real estate owned properties 
the other repossessed asset of million as of december  is the result of the repossession of an aircraft 
the following table sets forth the company s percent of allowance for loan losses to total allowance for loan losses and the percent of loans to total loans in each of the categories listed at the dates indicated 
at or for the years ended december  amount percent of allowance to total amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of allowance to total amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of allowance to total amount percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands commercial loans aircraft loans real estate construction loans secured by one to four family residential properties commercial properties consumer home equity lines of credit other total allowance at or for the years ended december  amount percent of allowance to total amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of allowance to total amount percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands commercial loans aircraft loans real estate construction loans secured by one to four familyresidential properties commercial properties consumer home equity lines of credit other total allowance as a result of past decreases in local and regional real estate values and the significant losses experienced by many financial institutions  there has been a greater level of scrutiny by regulatory authorities of the loan portfolios of financial institutions undertaken as a part of the examinations of such institutions by banking regulators 
while the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other assets premises and equipment  other repossessed assets  accrued interest and other assets  deferred tax asset  servicing assets  net and interest only strips  are the four major components of other assets 
premises and equipment increased to million  or as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase is due to opening two new branches in other repossessed assets increased to million as of december  due to the repossession of an aircraft 
there were no other repossessed assets as of december  accrued interest and other assets increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the major component of accrued interest and other assets is interest accrued and not yet received on loans 
the deferred tax asset increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase in the deferred tax asset is primarily related to additional allowances for loan losses and certain accrued expenses 
servicing asset  net  decreased to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the decrease reflects the amortization of the servicing asset  an impairment write down  partially offset by additions during the year ended december  the valuation of the servicing asset reflects estimates as to the expected life of the underlying loans which may be adversely affected by higher than expected levels of pay offs in periods of lower rates or charge offs in periods of economic difficulty 
in addition  when property values increase due to general economic conditions  borrowers have refinancing opportunities available to them  which may result in higher prepayment rates 
management periodically evaluates the servicing assets for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified based on original term to maturity 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the servicing assets for a stratum exceeds their fair value 
see the footnotes to the financial statements  found elsewhere in this report  for further information on servicing assets 
rights to future interest income from serviced loans that exceeds contractually specified servicing fees are classified as interest only strips 
interest only strips decreased to  as of december   compared to  as of december  deposits and borrowings total deposits increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits increased to million and million  respectively  as of december  compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  retail banking deposits increased  as did wholesale deposits  to fund sba loan retention and loans held for sale

interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business lending and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loans  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii 
changes in the nii he net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices 
the majority of the loans are tied to prime and reprice immediately 
the exception is sba a loans  which reprice on the first day of the subsequent quarter after a change in prime 
as of december   of the company s deposits were time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of the company s borrowings were fixed rate with a remaining term of years 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii by matching rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest income simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  particularly the one year maturity horizon 
interest income simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are normally subjected to up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
however  under the current interest rate environment  decreases in interest rates have been simulated at  and basis points 
under each interest rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure  of a financial institutions irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance sheet positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging ten months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated seven months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
while the maturities of interest bearing deposits in the following gap table imply that declines in interest rates will result in further declines in interest rates paid on deposits  interest rates cannot drop below  and there is a behavioral limit somewhere above as to how low the rates can be reduced before the company s customers no longer will maintain the deposit with the company 
in addition to the certificates of deposits  the company has million in interest bearing transaction accounts savings  money markets and interest bearing checking as of december   with rates being paid between and 
although the following table would indicate that declines in interest rates would result in a corresponding decline in the cost of deposits  interest rates cannot drop below  and there is a behavioral limit somewhere above as to how low the rates can be reduced before the company s customers no longer will maintain the deposit with the company 
the following table sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
such assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of their maturity or repricing date 
contractual static gap position as of december  months greater than months to months greater than months to months greater than monthsto years thereafter total balance dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets loans receivable adjustable rate loans  gross fixed rate loans  gross investments investment securities held to maturity federal funds sold other investments total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities deposits non interest bearing interest bearing other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap analysis interest rate sensitivity gap gap as of total interest sensitive assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as of total interest sensitive assets static gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on net interest income 
static gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of non rate funding sources 
the relation between product rate repricing and market rate changes basis risk is not the same for all products 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while non term deposit rates in general move more slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as non rate sensitive  such as noninterest bearing demand deposits  in the static gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make the company s behavior more asset sensitive than is indicated in the static gap analysis 
management expects to experience higher net interest income when rates rise  the opposite of what is indicated by the static gap analysis 
the following table shows the effects of changes in projected net interest income for under the interest rate shock scenarios stated 
the table was prepared as of december   at which time prime was 
dollars in thousands changes in rates projected net interest income change from base case change from base case bp bp bp bp bp bp bp assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategy 
liquidity the company closely monitors its liquidity so that the cash requirements for loans and deposit withdrawals are met in an economical manner 
management monitors liquidity in relation to trends of loans and deposits for short term and long term requirements 
liquidity sources are cash  deposits with other banks  overnight federal funds investments  unpledged interest bearing deposits at other banks  investment securities and the ability to sell loans 
as of december  liquid assets were of deposits compared to at december  capital the company s capital increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s equity to assets ratio was  and at december   and  respectively 
in july  the company raised million through a private placement of common stock 
also  in  the company implemented an employee stock ownership plan  funded with borrowings of  that year 
in  the loan was refinanced  with an additional  being advanced on the line during and another  in as of december  the indebtedness of the esop was  as of september   the board of directors elected to terminate the esop 
in february of  the unallocated shares of stock in the esop were sold  and the debt was paid in full 
as a result  the capital of the company will increase by  in the first quarter of during the years ended december  and  the company repaid principal totaling  and  respectively 
the company declared a five percent stock dividend to shareholders of record as of november   which was paid on november  the company declared a five percent stock dividend to shareholders of record as of november   which was paid on november  the company declared a five percent stock dividend to shareholders of record as of november   which was paid on november  whether or not stock dividends or any cash dividends will be paid in the future will be determined by the board of directors after consideration of various factors 
the company s and the bank s profitability and regulatory capital ratios in addition to other financial conditions will be key factors considered by the board of directors in making such determinations regarding the payment of dividends 
the company s strategic plan addresses the future capital needs of the company 
during march   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  community ca capital trust i the trust  a delaware business trust  issued million of fixed rate capital trust pass through securities trups registered trademark trust preferred securities  with a liquidation value of  per share 
the securities have semi annual interest payments  with principal due at maturity in the trust used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures of the company 
the company received million from the trust upon issuance of the junior subordinated debentures  of which million was used to pay off borrowings of the company  and million was contributed to the bank to increase its capital 
the million is shown as borrowings on the company s books 
on june   the company entered into a loan agreement with pacific coast bankers bank pursuant to which the company can borrow up to million on a revolving line of credit 
at december   the outstanding balance on this line of credit was million 
the proceeds of such loan were invested by the company in the bank in the form of equity capital 
the loan provides for interest only payments until december   after which time the outstanding balance of the loan will begin amortizing over a year period 
the loan documents require the company to obtain the prior consent of the lender before paying any cash dividend and before incurring additional indebtedness in excess of an additional million outside the normal course of business 
at the end of  all bank capital ratios were above all current federal capital guidelines for a well capitalized bank 
as of december  the bank s regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was compared to as of december  the regulatory tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio was as of december  compared to as of december  the regulatory tier capital to average assets ratio was as of december  compared to as of december  as of december   the company s capital ratios were above all current federal capital guidelines for capital adequacy purposes 
as of december   the company s regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was  compared to as of december  the regulatory tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio was as of december   compared to as of december   and the tier capital to average assets ratio was as of december   compared to as of december  management considers capital requirements as part of its strategic planning process 
the strategic plan calls for continuing increases in assets and liabilities  and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings 
the ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the capital markets as well as performance of the company 
in march of  the company issued million in trust preferred securities  which assisted in maintaining the company s and the bank s regulatory capital ratios at appropriate levels 
management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet its strategic objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments the affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the servicing assets and interest only strips and the valuation of other repossessed assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit  including off balance sheet credit extensions 
the allowance is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio  past loan loss experience and current economic conditions  which may affect the borrowers ability to pay  guarantees by government agencies and the underlying collateral value of the loans 
loans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
changes in these factors and conditions may cause management s estimate of the allowance to increase or decrease and result in adjustments to the company s provision for loan losses 
servicing assets and interest only strips 
servicing assets are recognized when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future net servicing income 
the fair value of servicing assets is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at estimated future current market rates for the expected life of the loans 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics in estimating the expected life of the loan 
management periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified based on original term to maturity 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the servicing asset for a stratum exceeds its fair value 
in estimating fair values at december   the company utilized a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and a discount rate of 
in estimating fair values at december   the company utilized a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and a discount rate of 
rights to future interest income from serviced loans that exceeds contractually specified servicing fees are classified as interest only strips 
the interest only strips are accounted for as trading securities and recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings in the period of change of fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on interest only strips were not material during the years ended december   and at december  and  the fair value of interest only strips was estimated using a weighted average prepayment assumption of approximately and  respectively  and a discount rate of changes in these assumptions and economic factors may result in increases or decreases in the valuation of our servicing assets and interest only strips 
real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
real estate or other assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell through a charge to the allowance for estimated loan losses 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
at december   the repossessed asset is an aircraft 
there are no specific reserves on this asset as of december  for further information on these and other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report
