disclosure about critical accounting policies the company s more critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  royalty income and the use of estimates which inherently involve judgment and uncertainties in valuing inventory and accounts receivable 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally satisfied and the company recognizes revenue upon shipment 
the company also offers certain of its customers the right to return products that do not meet the standards agreed with the customer 
the company continuously monitors such product returns and while such returns have historically been minimal  the company cannot guarantee that they will continue to experience the same return rates that they have in the past 
any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize

if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
products sold are covered by a lifetime warranty 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase accordingly and result in decreased gross profit

the company currently has two royalty agreements which expire in and  respectively 
the inability of the company to negotiate favorable royalty arrangements and renew current agreements could have a material adverse impact on the company s results for the period 
based upon the favorable relationships the company has with the parties under these license agreements  termination  non renewal or a renegotiation toward more unfavorable terms under the current agreements is not considered likely 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company values accounts receivable net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
as discussed under general factors our customers may cancel their orders or change purchase volumes 
any of these  or certain additional actions  could create excess inventory levels which would impact the valuation of our inventory 
the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past 
any actions taken by our customers that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly
