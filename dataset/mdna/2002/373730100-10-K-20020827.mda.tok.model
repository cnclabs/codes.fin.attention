item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview during fiscal  the company purchased five distribution businesses included in its sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
accordingly  these acquisitions were included in the company s consolidated balance sheets at april  and  and in the company s results from operations and cash flows since their respective acquisition dates 
in october  the securities and exchange commission sec commenced an investigation into the company s inventory and reserve accounting practices and related disclosures 
this investigation followed an earlier private investigation by the sec into trading in the securities of the company 
management believes that the company has cooperated fully with the sec staff in the investigations 
recently  the company completed an internal review of its financial reporting for the period january  through april  and has restated its financial statements for the fiscal years ended april  and  which effect has been included in this annual report on form k 
for the fiscal year ended april   the restatements have the effect of decreasing the previously reported loss per diluted share by  from a loss of per diluted share to a loss per diluted share of 
for the fiscal year ended april   the restatements have the effect of reducing p reviously reported earnings per diluted share by  from to 
retained earnings as of april  have been restated to reflect the impact of adjustments up to that date for periods not separately presented and the impact was a decrease to retained earnings at april  of million 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
the company s consolidated revenue in were million  a decrease of million or percent from million in the decrease reflected both lower product sales and service revenue 
revenues in the sign making and specialty graphics segment in fiscal were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in the apparel and flexible materials segment  fiscal revenues were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in the ophthalmic lens processing segment  revenues were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
capital spending in the sign making  apparel  and ophthalmic industries diminished 
aftermarket supplies revenues were lower than the prior year  but the economic weakness continued to have a more profound impact on equipment sales 
as was the case in fiscal  this impact was most notable in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
this segment s business continues to be affected by a migration of apparel production from north american and european markets to lower labor cost markets 
the adoption of factory automation in these lower cost markets has lagged the migration impact 
the lower equipment sales in the sign making and specialty graphics segment was due largely to weakening market conditions in european markets  particularly the united kingdom and germany 
aftermarket supplies revenues were lower primarily in the sign making and specialty graphics and ophthalmic lens processing operating segments 
the sign making and specialty graphics segment s reduction was caused by customer migration from the company s proprietary vinyl material products to lower cost commodity like products 
the ophthalmic lens processing segment s reduction was commensurate with lower industry prescription volumes 
service revenue in fiscal was down about percent from the decrease occurred in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment due to loss of service business in north america coincident with migration of the apparel industry to offshore locales 
weaker foreign currency translation rates lowered revenue approximately million percent in fiscal  which affected primarily the sign making and specialty graphics and apparel and flexible materials operating segments 
the downturn of the us economy  which began late in the third quarter of fiscal  continued throughout fiscal this was exacerbated by non us economic performance following the non us lead early in as a result  our order entry and backlog levels approached historic lows  and each of our operating segments reported lower revenue and order entry levels for the full year 
in response to the declining revenues  management continued to take steps to reduce the company s cost structure 
those initiatives resulted in pre tax charges of million related to actions to reduce overall headcount by approximately employees in the third quarter  in addition to restructuring actions taken in fiscal the company also began implementation of best practice and shared services initiatives across the company to further improve operating results and competitiveness 
on a geographic basis  fiscal sales to us customers were million lower  to european customers million lower  and to all other customers million lower than in the prior year 
the us sales decline occurred almost entirely in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
this decline was mitigated by a stabilization of demand later in fiscal for both the apparel and flexible materials and ophthalmic lens processing segments products 
us sales in the ophthalmic lens processing segment were higher than in the prior fiscal year and the gains were caused by equipment shipments to large us discount chains later in fiscal sales declines outside of us markets occurred in each operating segment and were the result of worsening global economic conditions 
the largest declines were in non european international markets 
these markets particularly china  japan  australia  and turkey have been negatively affected by the follow on effect of the north american capital equipment market weakness  currency crises in south american and asian markets  and increased competition 
gross profit margins 
the overall gross profit margin in fiscal was percent  which was higher than the prior year margin of percent 
margins on product sales were lower but were higher on service revenue 
the decrease in the product gross profit margin was the result of lower product sales  competitive pricing effects  and unfavorable business mix 
from a business mix perspective  lower equipment sales continued to impact profitability and caused lower margin aftermarket supplies revenue to represent a higher proportion of total product sales 
equipment sales hardware and software were percent of total sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior fiscal year 
additionally  the company lowered certain equipment product prices in the sign making and specialty graphic segment s european business in an effort to maintain market position 
these negative margin effects were more than entirely offset by aggressive cost reductions and pro ductivity improvements 
see the discussion below under restructuring and other charges and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
service gross margins in fiscal also benefited 
the company expects to further improve its gross margin with implementation of productivity and shared service initiatives 
weaker foreign currency translation rates lowered the overall gross margin approximately million in fiscal selling  general administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  excluding goodwill amortization  were about percent of revenue in fiscal  down from percent in fiscal cost reductions were responsible for most of this improvement  offset by higher warranty and other costs related to maxx  fourth quarter charges associated with an internal review at spandex  and higher corporate charges 
r d expense in fiscal decreased only slightly from fiscal levels 
restructuring and other charges 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
these charges were recorded in each of the company s operating segments  including corporate headquarters 
the corporate level charges and certain operating segment charges  were coincident with the company s decision to pursue a corporate shared services model for its operating units 
this change was designed to increase ownership of corporate staff functions at business units and  through shared services initiatives  realize cost savings through supply chain consolidation and other benefits 
the restructuring charge was comprised entirely of severance and related employment termination costs associated with workforce reductions of salaried and hourly employees 
annualized savings are expected to be approximately million 
the pre tax charge will require additional cash payments and will be funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
as of april   positions were eliminated with the balance targeted for completion by the end of the fiscal third quarter 
fourth quarter charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded pre tax charges of million in the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
production delays and technical difficulties associated with digital imaging products represented million of the charges and reflected inventory write downs caused by market introductions of competing products at selling prices lower than the company s carrying cost 
the charges also reflected obligations associated with upgrades for units already sold and the return of some units 
of the aggregate charge of million  approximately million was included in cost of sales as an inventory write down  primarily due to changing market conditions and production delays associated with gerber scientific products maxx thermal digital imaging system  and million in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the remaining million of charges related to asset write downs  contractual obligations  and employee costs associated with the company s spandex plc business included in its sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
completion of the company s fiscal restructuring initiatives in fiscal resulted in reversal of unexpended accruals of million 
goodwill amortization and impairment 
on may   the company adopted statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and ceased amortizing goodwill  which reduced amortization expense 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  adoption of a new accounting principle resulted in a write off of approximately million in research and development expenses 
the company s r d expenses for fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal of million was million lower than fiscal  primarily due to lower average debt levels 
substantially all borrowings were against the company s multi currency revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on these borrowings is based on libor for the relevant currency and term plus a margin based on the relationship of the company s consolidated total debt to ebitda over the trailing four quarters 
increases in the interest rate margin and fees associated with amendments to the company s credit facility were significant offsets to reductions in libor during the year and the impact of the company s improving ebitda 
these increases almost completely offset the benefits of the lower debt levels on interest expense for the year 
certain debt covenants were amended on january  and further waived on april  as the company was not able to achieve required levels originally set see credit facility d iscussion below 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenue of million in fiscal was about percent lower than in fiscal  reflecting lower product and service revenue 
the sales decline occurred in the apparel and flexible materials and sign making and specialty graphics operating segments 
weaker foreign currency translation rates  especially in europe  lowered revenue approximately million percent and affected each operating segment 
holding exchange rates constant  revenue was effectively the same in both the sign making and specialty graphics and ophthalmic lens processing operating segments  but significantly lower in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
foreign currency effects on competitive pricing also reduced revenue and profitability in that segment 
weaker demand for capital equipment in us markets due to deterioration in economic conditions pressured product sales in each of the company s operating segments 
sales of aftermarket supplies also fell in the us  but the economic softening had a more profound impact on equipment sales  resulting in the significant product sales shortfall compared with the prior fiscal year 
this impact was most notable in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
also affecting product sales comparability was the introduction of a new digital imaging system maxx in the sign making and specialty graphics segment 
maxx was subsequently placed on technical hold 
businesses acquired in the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment in generated million in incremental sales compared with the prior fiscal year 
the company s marketing initiative in the packaging industry launched in fiscal added million to combined sales and service revenue included in the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
service revenue in fiscal decreased million or percent from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease occurred primarily in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment  and resulted from the translation effect on service revenue earned in weaker european currencies and some loss of service business in the us the decline in us service revenue is coincident with the continuing migration of the apparel industry to offshore locales 
on a geographic basis  sales in fiscal to us and european customers were million and million lower than the prior fiscal year  respectively 
sales to customers in all other international markets were million higher than the prior fiscal year 
the us sales decline occurred in the apparel and flexible materials and sign making and specialty graphics operating segments and reflected weakening economic conditions and decreased capital spending 
us sales in the ophthalmic lens processing segment were slightly higher than the prior fiscal year 
european sales declined in each operating segment  most notably in apparel and flexible materials and sign making and specialty graphics 
these declines reflected weakening foreign currency translation rates and discounting sales prices to european customers to remain competitive 
sales gains in other international markets provided some offset to us and european declines 
however  international markets  particularly in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment  were decidedly slower in the fourth quarter  as currencies were under pressure 
gross profit margins 
the overall gross profit margin in fiscal was percent  compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
margins on both product and service revenue were lower 
the decrease in the product gross profit margin percent in compared with percent in was the result of the lower sales  a shift in sales mix on both a product and geographic basis  and the impact of lower european currency values  which pressured sales and impacted price competitiveness 
weaker demand for capital equipment resulted in a proportional shift from higher margin equipment sales hardware and software to lower margin aftermarket sales consumables and spare parts 
there was lower volume of higher margin computer aided design systems and software 
the increase in sales in international markets and weakness in the us market also had negative gross margin implications 
sales in the us generally have been more profitable than in international ma rkets  where many sales are through independent distribution and agency networks 
continued deterioration of foreign currency valuations further eroded gross margins  particularly in apparel and flexible materials 
lower product sales also hurt margins because there was less equipment production to absorb fixed factory overhead costs 
the decrease in service margins in fiscal resulted from improved classification of expenses as a result of implementation of an enterprise resource planning system 
the system distinguishes more clearly between warranty  installation  and training and the fulfillment of service contract obligations 
a decrease in the north american service business was also a factor 
selling  general administrative expenses 
sg a cost reductions in fiscal reflected reduced employment levels  lower incentive compensation and pension expenses  lower commissions paid due to the lower sales volume  and weaker foreign currency exchange rates 
higher expenses associated with the continued implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired in fiscal  and additional warranty provisions provided as part of the special charges taken were partial offsets 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses fell in fiscal from prior year levels as new product introduction slowed 
restructuring and other charges 
the company implemented plans in fiscal to reduce worldwide employment by employees  discontinue product lines  and consolidate facilities in response to extremely difficult us economic conditions  the continued weak euro  and problems experienced in rollout of new products 
as a result  the company recorded pre tax charges of million in fiscal of which million was a write off of receivables  million in cost of sales  million in selling  general  and administrative expenses  million write down of assets  and million as restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal of million was million higher than the increase was the result of higher average interest rates and  to a lesser extent  higher average debt balances 
the lower ebitda during caused the debt to ebitda relationship leverage ratio to rise and  accordingly  the interest margin over libor to rise 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
the year ended april  operating results reflected higher sales but diminished sales growth compared to the prior fiscal year  although the ophthalmic lens processing segment experienced a sales decline  which was anticipated 
sales of sign making and specialty graphics equipment and supplies grew about percent  primarily reflecting the strength of the european economy 
new product introductions helped sales in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
service revenue also increased  principally as a result of incentives used in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
gross profit margins 
overall  margins for fiscal were lower 
better margins on services were more than offset by lower gross profits on product sales 
margin erosion was attributable in significant part to foreign currency fluctuations 
excess costs of million related to initial production of a new product also hurt margins 
selling  general administrative expenses 
a variety of factors contributed to higher sg a expenses in fiscal  including increases in marketing costs related to new products  sg a expenses of acquired businesses  and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources fiscal year the company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the company s short term liquidity at april  was adequate for its requirements and the company expects that available cash and its existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements over the near term 
longer term  the company believes that existing cash balances  anticipated cash flows  and borrowings against its credit facility will be sufficient to meet operating requirements through august   subject to the terms of the company s credit facility 
however  there is no assurance that the company will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
further  the impact on the company s cash flow could be significant if it were unable to meet required covenants in its credit facility 
this might be caused by a continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions that would affect demand for the company s products  additional charges that may be required because of weak economic conditions  market changes  and delayed product introductions  and the company s ability to complete its ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiencies 
accordingly  additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  and may be dilutive to then current shareholders 
the company may also require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if the company were unable to obtain sufficient capital  it would be required to further curtail capital equipment purchases and research and development expenditures  further reduce employee headcount  and consider further asset sales  which could harm business 
in may  the company obtained a five year million multi currency revolving credit facility from a group of major us and international commercial banks 
the credit facility  as extended  is scheduled to expire in august the purpose of the credit facility was to finance the acquisition of the capital stock of spandex and the refinancing of its debt  and for other general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is variable and is based on either libor london interbank offered rate or prime plus an applicable margin 
this margin is based on the company s leverage ratio consolidated total debt divided by ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  as defined 
the amended credit facility provides for an annual fee that ranges from percent to percent of the banks aggregate commitment  which amounted to million at april  the weighted average interest rate of the borrowings under this credit facility as of april  was percent 
borrowings outstanding on the credit facility were million at that date and are secured by the accounts receivable and inventories of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  and the capital stock of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the company is also required to maintain certain financial covenants including maximum leverage total adjusted debt divided by ebitda  as defined minimum consolidated net worth quarterly test  as defined minimum fixed charge coverage quarterly test  as defined maximum capital expenditures annual test maximum cash balances daily test minimum net revenue rolling six months  as defined the credit facility also has covenants that limit the company s ability to pay dividends and make investments while the company s leverage ratio is greater than to and provisions that limit subsidiary indebtedness 
at april   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
failure to be in compliance with any material provision of the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position  and results of operations 
at a minimum  such noncompliance could result in higher borrowing costs caused by further amendments that would be required to the company s current credit facility or from a complete refinancing of its debt 
in january  the company amended its credit facility to change its maximum leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage  and minimum consolidated net worth financial covenants 
compliance with these covenants at april  was waived in accordance with anticipated charges relating to inventory and other write downs in the company s sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
the financial covenants restricting the levels of capital expenditures and cash and investment balances  and a minimum net revenue level also were added in january this amendment also included increases to the applicable libor margin 
effective january   the company reduced the amount of the banks commitment under the agreement to million  and at april  to million 
the company had voluntarily reduced the amount of the banks commitment from million to million on august   reflecting the use of the proceeds from the sale and leaseback of certain facilities 
the company further amended its credit facility on july   subsequent to the close of its fiscal year 
this amendment included an extension of the agreement s termination date to august   changed the maximum leverage ratio  minimum consolidated net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum net revenue  and maximum capital expenditures financial covenants  and included further increases to the applicable libor margin 
also effective with this amendment  the company further reduced the amount of the banks commitment under the agreement to million on july   to million on january   and to million on april  a fee of 
percent based on the outstanding banks commitment is required to be paid by december  should the borrowings under the agreement not be paid in full on or before that date 
a significant risk to the company is that it will not be able to secure alternative financing by the time the current credit facility becomes due in august the risk that the company will not be able to repay amounts needed pursuant to the lower commitment levels  particularly at april   is also significant 
should the company not be able refinance its current credit facility in time for scheduled commitment reductions or its maturity  the company would have to consider additional significant asset sales  which could harm business 
in  the company also amended its credit agreement to change certain financial covenants 
added in this amendment were the restrictions on dividends and investments and the requirement that the net cash proceeds from asset sales be used to reduce debt and the banks aggregate commitment while debt exceeds two times ebitda 
also added was the requirement that borrowings under the credit agreement be secured by certain of the company s assets 
this amendment included increases to the applicable libor margin and  effective on execution  the company reduced the amount of the banks commitment under the agreement from million to million 
at april  and  the company s long term debt also included tax exempt industrial revenue bonds amounting to million 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt was percent at april  and percent at april  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at april  and to at april  net working capital at april  was million  a decrease of million from the beginning of the fiscal year 
the decrease in working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to lower cash balances maintained at foreign locations  lower accounts receivable resulting from lower revenue and accelerated cash collection efforts  lower inventory balances resulting from lower product sales and write downs due to changing market conditions  the classification of the current portion of the company s long term debt into current liabilities  and the sale and leaseback of facilities previously held for sale 
lower accounts payable balances  due largely to the timing of vendor and employee payments  were offsets to the cash generation in fiscal year these lower working capital levels are expected to continue in the short term  particularly related to inventory reduction programs 
longer term  shared services initiatives aimed at working capital efficiency  supply chain management  production  and customer service are designed to improve the company s profitability and ability to generate operating cash flow 
net working capital included million and million of assets held for sale at april  and april   respectively 
on august   the company completed the sale and leaseback of three facilities including its headquarters in south windsor  ct 
net proceeds from this transaction of approximately million were used to reduce long term debt 
the remaining amount represented the carrying value adjusted to fair value of certain facilities and land that the company has sold or intends to sell and use the proceeds to reduce long term debt 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal s operating cash flow of million down from million in the prior fiscal year was generated primarily from net earnings adjusted for non cash charges 
the decrease was due to higher working capital reductions and tax refunds received in fiscal the principal non operating use of cash in fiscal was for net repayments of long term debt 
capital expenditures decreased about million compared with the prior fiscal year  reflecting reprioritization of capital projects 
the company anticipates capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately million  with no major capital projects planned 
funding for these capital expenditures is expected to come from cash on hand and cash from operations 
currently  the company does not pay dividends 
at april   the company had credit commitments from banks totaling million under an amended multi currency revolving credit facility 
at april   borrowings under that facility amounted to million 
the company s total long term debt including current maturities at april  was million  down million from the april  balance of million 
net debt total debt less cash and short term cash investments was million at april  compared with million at april  and the ratio of net debt to total capital increased to percent at april  from percent at april  the higher ratio was caused predominantly by the goodwill impairment charge recorded 
contractual cash obligations and commitments at april   the company had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments in thousands total less than year years years thereafter contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment outstanding line of credit fiscal year cash and short term cash investments totaled million at april  compared with million at april  net working capital was million at april  compared with million at april  the working capital ratio was to at april  and  respectively 
the million working capital decrease was the result of increased efforts to convert receivables and inventory into cash and reduce long term debt 
the impact of the lower receivables and inventory balances was partially offset by certain properties designated as held for sale in fiscal operating activities provided million in cash in fiscal  despite a net loss for the year 
principal non operating uses of cash in fiscal were for net repayments of long term debt of million  additions to property  plant and equipment of million  and dividends of million 
in february  the company s board of directors voted to suspend the company s 
quarterly dividend subsequent to the february payment 
the principal non operating source of cash in fiscal was proceeds of million from the sale of an idle facility in connecticut and a sale leaseback transaction for the bristol  uk facility of its spandex plc subsidiary 
these proceeds were used to reduce long term debt 
fiscal year operating activities provided million in cash in fiscal higher accounts receivable and inventory balances were a significant offset  caused by record fourth quarter sales  delayed introduction of certain new products in the sign making and specialty graphics segment  and business acquisitions 
cash generated from operations also was reduced by lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances due largely to timing of vendor payments 
the principal non operating uses of cash in fiscal were for additions to property  plant  and equipment of million and business acquisitions in the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment of million 
in the year ended april   the company repurchased  shares under its common stock repurchase program at a cost of million 
other non operating uses of cash in fiscal included payment of dividends of million 
existing and potential claims against the company alleging violations of the securities laws purported class action litigation following an earlier securities and exchange commission sec investigation into trading in securities of the company  the sec in october initiated investigation of the company s inventory and reserve accounting practices and related disclosures 
management believes that the company has cooperated fully with the sec staff in these investigations 
in addition  the company commenced its own internal review of its financial reporting for the period january  through april  the audit committee of the board of directors has directed this review with assistance from the law firm wilmer  cutler and pickering and the financial investigative firm of ten eyck associates 
on april  the company issued a press release announcing that it expected to take a special pre tax charge of about million dollars in its fourth quarter ending april   the sec s investigation into the company s inventory and reserve accounting practices and related disclosures  the institution of its own internal review of its financial reporting  that it believed a restatement of prior financial statements would be likely  and that it would be seeking certain relief from its banks under its existing credit agreement 
on april   the company issued a press release that it had reached agreement with its bank group for the waiver of certain covenants related to its credit facility for the fourth quarter ending april  and on july  announced that it had reached agreement with its bank group to amend the company s covenants and extend its credit facility through august  since the april  press release  the company is aware that at least eight lawsuits have been filed naming the company and certain of its existing and former officers as defendants 
these lawsuits purport to be class actions brought on behalf of a class consisting generally of all persons with some exclusions  including officers and directors of the company who purchased the company s common stock between may  and april  and who were damaged thereby 
they generally allege that the company and or certain of its officers and directors violated the anti fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws by knowingly promulgating false and misleading financial statements  upon which purchasers of the company s stock relied during the period for which the restated financial statements are to be issued 
damages have not been specified but these lawsuits apparently seek to recover all losses incurred by all members of the purported class in purchasing the company s common stock during the period from may  to april  during this period the closing prices for the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange ranged from a high of approximately per share to a low of approximately per share 
it is possible that other lawsuits may be brought against the company alleging violations of various provisions of federal and or state securities and other laws 
the company is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these asserted and unasserted claims or to predict the cost to resolve them 
however  the costs of defending the company and its current and former officers and directors who may be named as defendants  as well as related costs  are likely to be significant 
costs through july  since the inception of the sec s investigations  including costs of conducting an internal review of its financial statements and defending the pending lawsuits were substantial and are likely to continue to be substantial unless these claims and the sec investigations are promptly resolved 
during the relevant periods  the company had in place insurance that the company believes may offset most or a portion of these costs but  to date  no amounts have been reimbursed by any insurance company 
claims which may be asserted under the company s k plan in december  the company registered  shares of the company s common stock to be purchased by an independent trustee in the open market for the benefit and at the direction of company employees pursuant to the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries k maximum advantage program and trust the plan 
approximately million shares were acquired by plan participants before this option was discontinued on july  the purchase of shares under the plan in excess of the number of shares registered may have been exempt from registration under the securities act of the company understands  however  that the staff of the securities and exchange commission takes the position that one possible exemption  under section a of the securities act  would not apply to shares of an employer sponsored plan acquired in the open market by an independent trustee at the direction and for the benefit of employee participants pursuant to plans of this type ie  plans in which employee contributions can be directed toward the purchase of a company s stock and the company s matching contributions may be less than for 
if the acquisitions of these shares are found not to have been exempt from registration  the company could be liable under section a of the securities act for rescission or damages to the employees who purchased these shares 
under section of the securities act  a rescission right  which is the effective equivalent to a put right  can be maintained to enforce liability under section a at any time within one year after the violation on which it is based but not more than three years after the relevant securities were first offered to the public 
a rescission right would entitle the employee purchasers of these shares to receive the return of the amounts paid for these shares  together with interest from the date of purchase 
the current members of the plan s administrative committee  on the advice of counsel  have requested the company to toll  as of july   any statutes of limitations with respect to claims which might be made by or on behalf of plan participants alleging that the company should have registered these shares 
the company is considering this request but has not yet determined how to respond to it 
the prices paid for shares acquired during the one year prior to july  aggregated approximately million 
the prices paid for all of the unregistered shares which were acquired under the plan aggregated approximately million 
in addition to any claims that may be asserted under the securities act  claims may also be asserted under the employee retirement income security act of for recovery of losses incurred with respect to the purchase of the unregistered shares 
the company does not currently intend to offer rescission to the purchasers of these shares and intends to defend against any claim for either rescission or damages 
however  the possibility of such a claim gives rise to a contingent liability that  if realized  could adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
given the current status of this unasserted claim  the company cannot reasonably estimate a loss 
lease financing arrangements the company has an agreement with a major financial services institution to provide lease financing to purchasers of the company s equipment 
the present value of the lease receivables financed amounted to approximately million at april  and million at april  the equipment collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  the company has liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions 
the company s liability for uncollected amounts financed in excess of the estimated resale value of the equipment is limited to the extent of loss pools 
management believes the allowance established for losses under the recourse provisions is reasonable 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation allowance for doubtful accounts the company continually monitors payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
various factors including accounts receivable agings  customer credit worthiness  and historical bad debts are considered by the company when it evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates and results in their inability to make payments 
as of april   the company s net accounts receivable balance was million 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or market value 
cost is based on a weighted average basis  which approximates a first in  first out basis 
the company reviews market value of inventory on an ongoing basis with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
in this year s fourth quarter  the company wrote down to management s estimate of market value inventories of digital imaging products relating to its sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
this was caused by the recent introduction of competing products at prices less than the carrying cost of the company s products 
the write downs totaled million 
if actual market conditions for these products or any of the company s inventories are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
as of april   the company s inventory bal ance was million 
goodwill and intangible assets the company reviews the value of its long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate 
during fiscal  the company recognized goodwill impairments amounting to million 
as of april   the company had million of goodwill and intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet  which management believes is realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses and technology 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used  such as future sales and expense levels  in assessing that value may need to be re evaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of those assets 
restructuring charges over the last two years  the company has undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which has required development of formalized plans for separating employees  discontinuing product lines  and consolidating certain facilities 
these plans required management to use estimates related to properties held for sale  which resulted in write downs of those properties 
additionally  the company had to record estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  inventory write downs  long term asset impairments  and other related costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires the company to record provisions and charges when management commits to a formal plan 
as management continues to evaluate the r easonableness of the remaining liabilities under the restructuring initiatives and the business  there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on the company s products for periods ranging from days to one year and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires management to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace products under warranty
