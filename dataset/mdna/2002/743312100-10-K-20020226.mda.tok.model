software license revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in software license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in demand from end user customers as well as independent software vendors isvs  companies which have written software applications utilizing progress software technology and which resell the company s products in conjunction with the sale of their applications 
the software license decrease was partially offset by sales from new products such as sonicmq 
in addition  the company s license revenue was adversely affected by the strong us dollar  especially relative to the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real 
software license revenue from development products  such as progress provision  and most deployment products  including progress rdbms  decreased year over year 
partially offsetting the decline in license revenue from these product groups was a significant increase in license revenue from sonicmq 
however  this product line currently represents a small percentage of total software license revenue 
maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was primarily the result of growth in the company s installed customer base and renewal of maintenance contracts  growth in international consulting revenue  especially in europe  middle east and africa emea 
the maintenance and services revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in consulting revenue in north america and global education revenue 
the decline in north america consulting revenue was primarily due to delays in new engagements  fewer projects as a result of economic conditions and a slower overall market  especially in the erp sector  for professional services in fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside north america decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was the result of substantially lower revenue in the asia pacific and latin america regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in these regions was due to an overall market slowdown in the purchase of packaged applications  especially in the government sector in various countries within latin america

s dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving its forecasts and plans or that other factors will not negatively impact its revenue 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of cost of product media  documentation  duplication  packaging  royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of software licenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of software license revenue from to 
the dollar increase was primarily due to higher royalty expense for products and technologies licensed from third parties  partially offset by lower amortization expense from previously capitalized software costs 
the percentage increase was due to fixed costs  including certain distribution costs  being spread over a smaller base of license revenue as well as changes in product mix 
cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license revenue varies from period to period depending upon the relative product mix in a given period 
cost of maintenance and services consists primarily of costs of providing customer technical support  education and consulting

table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to an increase in compensation costs for the sales  sales support and marketing staff  partially offset by a decrease in the level of discretionary marketing spending for trade shows  advertising campaigns  direct mail solicitations and other events

this decrease was mitigated to some extent by the company s efforts to manage costs and expenses as expected revenue was not achieved 
international operations contributed of the total operating income in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in the percentage of operating income generated by international operations was due to investments in new business  such as sonic software and nusphere  in north america 
if the company is able to meet its forecasted revenue target and expenses occur as planned  the company expects operating income as a percentage of revenue to be approximately in fiscal other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to foreign currency losses in fiscal as compared to foreign currency gains in fiscal and lower interest income 
the foreign currency losses in fiscal primarily related to premiums paid for foreign exchange option contracts and translation losses on intercompany receivable balances

table of contents factors that may affect future results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves certain risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in revenue and quarterly results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors 
some of these factors include changes in demand for the company s products  introduction  enhancement or announcement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  the growth rates of certain market segments including messaging  size and timing of significant orders  budgeting cycles of customers  mix of distribution channels  mix of products and services sold  mix of international and north american revenues  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in the company s sales incentive plans  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products announced by the company or its competitors and general economic conditions 
revenue forecasting is uncertain  in large part  because the company generally ships its products shortly after receipt of orders 
most of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  including costs of personnel and facilities  and are not easily reduced 
thus  an unexpected reduction in the company s revenue  or failure to achieve the anticipated rate of growth  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 
global economic conditions the uncertain effects on the global economy and the current business climate of the september  terrorist attacks may impact the company s revenue in the near term 
global economic conditions have continued to weaken since that event 
if customer buying patterns  such as lengthier decision making processes  timing of expected deliveries and timing of new projects  change due to worsening economic conditions  there will be a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
products ongoing enhancements to the progress product set and sonic product set will be required to enable the company to maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to its products on a timely basis  or that the enhancements will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
delays in the release of enhancements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company has derived most of its revenue from its core product line  progress  and other products that complement progress and are generally licensed only in conjunction with progress 
accordingly  the company s future results depend on continued market acceptance of progress and any factor adversely affecting the market for progress could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
the company is currently developing and enhancing the sonic product set and other new products and services 
the market for web services  messaging products  other internet business to business products and application integration software is highly competitive 
many potential customers have made significant investments in proprietary or internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products 
global e commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks continue to evolve 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successful in penetrating these new and evolving markets 
rapid technological change overlaying the risks associated with the company s existing products and enhancements are ongoing technological developments and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to new customer requirements 
the company is currently developing new products intended to help 
table of contents organizations meet the future needs of application developers 
the development of new products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products incorporating new technology on a timely basis  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
future acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
such acquisitions or investments include the risks of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  realizing the value of the acquired assets relative to the price paid  distraction of management from the company s ongoing businesses and potential product disruptions associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share may result in connection with any such future acquisition 
distribution channels and new markets future results also depend upon the company s continued successful distribution of its products through its isv channel and may be impacted by downward pressure on pricing  which may not be offset by increases in volume 
isvs utilize technology from the company to create their applications and resell the company s products along with their own applications 
during fiscal and fiscal  revenue from the isv channel decreased as compared to the previous periods 
if this negative revenue trend were to continue through fiscal  the company s business and operating results would be adversely affected 
any other adverse effect on the isvs business related to competition  pricing and other factors could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company expects to devote significant resources to enable its isvs to move their applications to the internet and the application service provider asp distribution model by providing a combination of technology  professional services and partnerships 
the asp distribution model enables isvs to rent their business applications to end user organizations over the internet or through other thin client technologies 
the asp market is new and evolving 
there can be no assurance that the asp model will become a viable market for business applications or that the company will be successful in penetrating this new market 
nusphere has and continues to develop a set of products and services for the open source market 
the success of an open source business model  which gives customers the right to freely copy and distribute software  is unproven 
few open source software products have gained widespread commercial acceptance partly due to the lack of viable open source industry participants to offer adequate service and support on a long term basis 
in addition  open source vendors are not able to provide industry standard warranties and indemnities for their products  since these products have been developed largely by independent parties over whom open source vendors exercise no control or supervision 
there can be no assurance that nusphere will be successful in building a sustainable business model or that the enhanced open source products provided by nusphere will attain sufficient market acceptance to support such a business 
competition the company experiences significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to the marketing and distribution of its products 
many of these competitors have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than the company and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than can the company 
increased competition could make it more difficult for the company to maintain its market presence 
the marketplace for new products is intensely competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
as a result  new competitors possessing technological  marketing or other competitive advantages may emerge and rapidly acquire market share 

table of contents in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to deliver products that better address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
current and potential competitors also may be more successful than the company in having their products or technologies widely accepted 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and its failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
international operations approximately of the company s total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal was attributable to international sales made through its subsidiaries 
because a majority of the company s total revenue is derived from such international operations that are primarily conducted in foreign currencies  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
there can be no assurance that the company s currency hedging transactions will materially reduce the effect of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on such results 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies were imposed  the company s business could be adversely affected 
other potential risks inherent in the company s international business generally include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one of these factors could adversely impact the success of the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations  and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
hiring and retention of skilled employees the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
there is significant competition for such personnel in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to successfully develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies principally on a combination of contract provisions and copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
third party technology the company also utilizes certain technology which it licenses from third parties  including software which is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there 
table of contents can be no assurance that functionally similar technology will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future  or at all 
stock price volatility the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other technology companies  is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and has policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company limits default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
the company s investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  the company has classified all its debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 
the company has entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge certain transactions of selected foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company has not entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the designation of the contracts as hedging instruments 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and matching of derivative instruments to the underlying transactions 
market value increases and decreases on the foreign exchange option and forward contracts are generally recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the company operates in certain countries where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the company generally does not hedge the net assets of its international subsidiaries 
the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange option contracts at november  was million 
unrealized market value gains on such contracts were immaterial at november  based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  the company s revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and the company s net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from the company s ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
