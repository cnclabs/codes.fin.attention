item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to the risks discussed in this report under the heading other factors that may affect results 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
recent developments on february   we completed the acquisition of woodwind communications systems  inc  a provider of voice over broadband network edge access solutions 
we issued million shares of common stock and paid million in cash in exchange for all of woodwind s outstanding capital stock 
in addition  we assumed woodwind s outstanding stock options  which  if fully vested and exercised  would result in the issuance of million shares of vina common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
during july  we announced and completed a restructuring plan intended to better align our operations with the changing market conditions 
this plan is designed to prioritize vina s higher growth areas of business  focus on opportunities for profit contribution and reduce expenses 
this restructuring included workforce reduction of approximately employees across all functions and an operational reorganization 
during the quarter ended december   we sold approximately million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock in a private offering  resulting in the receipt of gross proceeds by vina of approximately million 
the warrants issued pursuant to this offering have an exercise price of per share  and have a three year term  subject to earlier termination if our share price equals or exceeds for a period of out of any consecutive trading days 
we expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital  research and development and general corporate purposes 
proceeds may also be used to make strategic investments  acquire or license technology or products  or acquire businesses that may complement our business 
in december  we acquired optical concentration technology and related equipment business of metrobility optical systems 
in connection with this acquisition we issued to the sierra ventures entities million shares of our common stock valued at million on the purchase date 
the total purchase price including  in direct acquisition expenses was allocated on a fair value basis resulting in million of intellectual property intangible assets and million of fixed assets 
overview vina technologies  inc is a leading developer of multiservice broadband access communications equipment that enables communications service providers to deliver bundled voice and data services 
our products integrate various broadband access technologies  including existing circuit based and emerging packet based networks  onto a single platform to alleviate capacity constraints in communications networks 
from our inception in june through february  our operating activities related primarily to developing and testing prototype products  commencing the staffing of our sales and customer service organizations and establishing relationships with our customers 
we began shipping our multiservice integrator product family in march  our multiservice xchange product in may and our mbx product in september since inception  we have incurred significant losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we market and sell our products and services directly to communications service providers and through oem customers and value added resellers  or vars 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generated from the sale of communications equipment embedded with software that is essential to its functionality  and accordingly  the company accounts for these transactions in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized when all sab no 
and sop criteria are met which generally occurs at the time of shipment 
in multiple element arrangements where there are undelivered elements at the time of shipment  product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment as the residual value of the arrangement after allocation of fair value to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
service revenue is generated from the sale of installation  training and postcontract customer support pcs agreements related to the communications equipment 
the company also accounts for these transactions in accordance with sab no 
and sop  and as such recognizes revenue when all of the related revenue recognition criteria are met which is i at the time the installation or training service is delivered  and ii ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 
in multiple element arrangements where these services are undelivered when the communications equipment is shipped  the company defers the fair value of these undelivered elements based on vsoe and recognizes revenue as the services are delivered 
the company additionally records a provision for estimated sales returns and warranty costs at the time the product revenue is recognized 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our historical net revenue 
for the year ended december   sales to our three largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue  of which sales to lucent technologies  nuvox communications and advanced telcom group accounted for  and of our net revenue  respectively 
while the level of sales to any specific customer is anticipated to vary from period to period  we expect that we will continue to experience significant customer concentration for the foreseeable future 
to date  international sales have not been significant 
international sales have been denominated primarily in us dollars and  accordingly  we have not been exposed to significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of products manufactured by a third party contract manufacturer  component costs  depreciation of property and equipment  personnel related costs to manage the contract manufacturer and warranty costs  and excludes amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we conduct program management  manufacturing engineering  quality assurance and documentation control at our facility in newark  california 
we outsource our manufacturing and testing requirements to benchmark electronics 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to this contract manufacturer 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors  including competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  inventory obsolescence  costs of components and sub assemblies  costs from our contract manufacturers and the mix of products or system configurations sold 
additionally  our gross margin may fluctuate due to changes in our mix of distribution channels 
currently  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales made to our oem customers 
a significant increase in revenue to these oem customers would adversely reduce our gross margin percentage 
research and development expenses consist primarily personnel and related costs  consulting expenses and prototype costs related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our multiservice broadband access products  and excludes amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we expense all of our research and development expenses as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of  personnel and related costs  including salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in direct and indirect selling and marketing and other administrative functions and promotional costs  including trade shows and related costs  and excludes amortization of deferred stock compensation 
stock based compensation consists of the fair value of stock options granted to non employees for services and the amortization of deferred stock compensation on stock options granted to employees 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grant of the option and the exercise prices of these options 
we are amortizing deferred stock compensation using a multiple option award valuation approach over the vesting periods of the applicable options  which is generally four years 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation  based upon options granted through december   was million in and is expected to be million in  million in and  thereafter 
other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances partially offset by interest expense associated with our debt obligations 
from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state income tax purposes and have not recognized any income tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income that expire in varying amounts through and  respectively 
given our limited operating history and losses incurred to date  coupled with difficulty in forecasting future results  a full valuation allowance has been provided against deferred tax assets 
furthermore  as a result of changes in our equity ownership from our preferred stock offerings and initial public offering  utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations as defined by section of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 
for purposes of this table  cost of revenue  gross profit  research and development  and selling  general and administrative amounts and restructuring expenses do not include stock based compensation 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue excluding stock based compensation gross profit excluding stock based compensation costs and expenses research and development excluding stock based compensation selling  general and administrative excluding stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  net in process research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring expenses excluding stock based compensation total costs and expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss stock based compensation  net cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring expenses total fiscal years ended december   and net revenue 
net revenue was million in  million in and million in the increase in net revenues in over was primarily due to increased unit sales of integrator s and elink products to existing customers 
the increase in net revenue in over was primarily due to increased unit sales to existing customers and sales to new customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue including stock based compensation was million in  million in and million in gross profit including stock based compensation increased to million in from million in and million in gross margin including stock based compensation increased to in from in primarily due to a reduction in stock based compensation to million in compared to million in gross margin was further impacted in by a million charge for excess inventory purchase commitment incurred in the first quarter of the provision for the excess inventory purchase commitments was primarily the result of a shift in one of our customer s demands from next generation network equipment to traditional time division multiplex  or tdmnetwork equipment 
gross margin including stock based compensation decreased to in from in primarily due to increased stock based compensation in cost of revenue 
we anticipate that our gross margin may continue to fluctuate due to many factors  including competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  costs of components and subassemblies  costs from our contract manufacturers  the mix of products or system configurations sold and changes in our mix of distribution channels 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses including stock based compensation increased to million in from million in and million in these increases were primarily a result of additional personnel costs  higher prototype expenses and higher consulting costs associated with our continuing research and development efforts 
we believe continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product and cost reduction objectives  and as a result  we expect these research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
research and development expenses including stock based compensation have changed as a percentage of net revenue from in to in and in the increase from to was primarily due to an increase of million stock based compensation expense 
the decrease from to was due primarily due to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses including stock based compensation decreased to million in from million in due to a decrease in stock based compensation of million partially offset by a million increase in other general costs 
the increase in expense from million in to in was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation of million  increased personnel costs  including hiring of additional sales and key management personnel  as well as increased recruiting costs and increased promotional expenses  including trade shows and advertising 
selling  general and administrative expenses including stock based compensation decreased as a percentage of net revenue from in to in and in these decreases were a result of net revenue increasing at a rate faster than selling  general and administrative expenses and fluctuations in stock based compensation expenses 
we intend to actively participate in marketing  business development activities  selling and promotional programs  expand our field sales operations and customer support organizations and build our infrastructure to support our anticipated business growth and operation as a public company 
as a result  we expect expenses related to these programs to continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars in the future 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense decreased to million for from million for and increased from million for the increase from to is due to an increased number of options issued in with an exercise price below fair market value 
the decrease from to is due to using the multiple award approach for amortizing stock based compensation coupled with the net restructuring benefit of million associated with the reversal of prior period estimated stock compensation expense on previously amortized unvested stock options 
based on stock options granted through december   we expect to record amortization of stock compensation expense of million and million in and  respectively  and  thereafter 
in process research and development 
on february   we completed the acquisition of woodwind communications systems  inc  or woodwind 
in we recorded a one time charge of million for the purchased in process technology related to development projects that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and for which successful development was uncertain 
the conclusion that the in process development effort  or any material sub component  had no alternative future use was reached in consultation with the our and woodwind s management 
amortization of intangible assets 
on february  we completed the acquisition of woodwind communications systems  inc  or woodwind 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets of million 
in december we also purchased optical concentrator technology 
as part of the purchase  we acquired million of intellectual property intangible assets 
these assets are being amortized based on their expected useful lives 
the expense recorded in the year was million 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses  excluding the impact of stock based compensation  of  for the year ended december  resulted primarily from severance and outplacement costs associated with the workforce reduction plan in the third quarter of including the impact of stock based compensation  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million for the year ended december  as of december   we made  in severance payments 
the remaining balance of  related to severance and fringe benefits is expected to be disbursed in the first quarter of other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased to million  in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances resulting in lower interest earned 
interest and other income  net  increased to million in from  in this increase was primarily attributable to higher cash balances resulting in higher interest income earned offset by interest expense on bank loans incurred in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  the increase of million was attributable to cash provided by investing activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of short term securities and cash provided by financing activities was attributable to net proceeds from the sale of common stock 
cash used in operating activities of million consisted primarily of the net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of million partially offset by non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million for stock based compensation and million for in process research and development 
we anticipate operating expenses will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may use cash resources to fund acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of woodwind communications systems and of certain assets of metrobility optical systems  or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
during july  we announced a restructuring plan intended to better align our operations with changing market conditions 
with our cost reduction efforts and if we successfully execute our business plan  we believe we will be able to reach a cash flow break even position 
however  we will from time to time review and may pursue additional financing opportunities 
for example  to provide for additional working capital needs  in the quarter ended december   we issued approximately million shares and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  resulting in the receipt of gross proceeds of million 
if we are unable to execute our business plan as anticipated we may need to obtain additional funding during  and we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
currently  we have no other immediately available sources of liquidity 
the sale of additional equity or other securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
arrangements for additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
new accounting standards on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company does not utilize free standing and embedded derivative instruments 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company will stop the amortization of intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill  which includes the reclass of workforce in place  and tradenames with a net carrying value of million at december  and annual amortization of million that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the company has evaluated goodwill under sfas no 
and has determined the adoption of this statement will not result in an impairment 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for the company on january  management believes the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in november  consensus was reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no 
addresses the accounting consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
the eitf is effective for the company on january  management has not yet determined the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business because we have a limited operating history and operate in a new and rapidly evolving telecommunications market  you may have difficulty assessing our business and predicting our future financial results 
we were incorporated in june and did not begin shipping our products until march due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible for us to predict our future results of operations 
we have a history of losses  we expect future losses  and we may not be able to generate sufficient net revenue in the future to achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect that our net losses and negative cash flow from operations will continue for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
to achieve profitability  we will need to generate and sustain substantially higher net revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses for research and development  sales and marketing  customer support  developing direct sales and distribution channels  and general and administrative expenses 
we rely on a small number of telecommunications customers for substantial portions of our net revenue 
if we lose one of our customers or experience a delay or cancellation of a significant order or a decrease in the level of purchases from any of our customers  our net revenue could decline and our operating results and business could be harmed 
we derive almost all of our net revenue from direct sales to a small number of telecommunications customers and our indirect sales through lucent technologies  one of our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers that sell and market our products 
if we lose one of our customers or experience a delay or cancellation of a significant order or a decrease in the level of purchases from any of our customers  our net revenue could decline and our operating results and business could be harmed 
our three largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december   specifically sales to lucent technologies  nuvox communications  and advanced telcom group accounted for  and  respectively 
we expect that the telecommunications industry will continue to experience consolidation 
if any of our customers is acquired by a company that is one of our competitors customers  we may lose its business 
in addition  if an oem customer is acquired  we could lose that customer 
for example  intermedia communications  one of our service provider customers  was acquired by mci worldcom 
also  the ultimate business success of our direct service provider customers  our oem customers and value added resellers  or vars  and our indirect customers who purchase our products through an oem customer and vars  could affect the demand for our products 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more of our key customers could harm our operating results and financial condition 
if any of these events occur  our net revenue could decline and our operating results and business could be harmed 
the difficulties experienced by many of our current and potential clec customers have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business 
to date  we have sold the majority of our products to competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  customers  either directly or through our oem customers 
clecs have experienced extreme difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses 
as a result  clecs have been forced to scale back their operations or terminate their operations 
if our customers become unable to pay for shipped products  we may be required to write off significant amounts of our accounts receivable 
similarly  if our customers order products and then suspend or cancel the orders prior to shipping  we will not generate revenues from the products we build 
in such circumstances  our inventories may increase and our expenses will increase 
further  we may incur substantially higher inventory carrying costs and excess inventory that could become obsolete over time 
we expect that our business will continue to be significantly and negatively affected unless and until there is substantial improvement in the ability of clecs to finance their businesses 
since the telecommunications industry is characterized by large purchase orders placed on an irregular basis  it is difficult to accurately forecast the timing and size of orders 
accordingly  our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis depending upon the timing of our customers network deployment and sales and marketing efforts 
because orders we receive may have short lead times  we may not have sufficient inventory to fulfill these orders  and we may incur significant costs in attempting to expedite and fulfill these orders 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of our customers purchase decisions and order reductions or cancellations 
for example  under our oem agreement with lucent  lucent has the right to delay previously placed orders for any reason 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
accordingly  our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
our customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
after building a significant inventory of our products  these parties may be faced with delays in these anticipated major projects for various reasons 
for example  as a result  lucent may be required to maintain a significant inventory of our products for longer periods than they originally anticipated  which would reduce further purchases 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in our future results of operations and severely harm our business and financial condition 
we have a limited order backlog 
if we do not obtain substantial orders in a quarter  we may not meet our net revenue objectives for that quarter 
since inception  our order backlog at the beginning of each quarter has not been significant  and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we must obtain substantial additional orders in a quarter for shipments in that quarter to achieve our net revenue objectives 
our sales agreements allow purchasers to delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
our customer purchase orders also allow purchasers to cancel orders within negotiated time frames without significant penalty 
in addition  due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates  purchase orders and product availability  significant volume shipments of our products could occur near the end of our fiscal quarters 
if we fail to ship products by the end of a quarter  our operating results could be adversely affected for that quarter 
our products require substantial investment over a long product development cycle  and we may not realize any return on our investment 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process 
we and our oem customers have in the past and may in the future experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
for example  we expected to begin shipment of our mbx product in the second quarter of  but the schedule for these shipments was delayed to the third quarter of because of continued development issues and then suspended temporarily due to the mbx s failure to meet all of its specified applications 
development costs and expenses are incurred before we generate any net revenue from sales of products resulting from these efforts 
we intend to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses  which could have a negative impact on our earnings in future periods 
if we do not predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs and suffer manufacturing delays 
we currently provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturer months prior to scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
lead times for the materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if we overestimate our manufacturing requirements  demand for our products are lower than forecasted  or a product in our manufacturing forecast becomes obsolete  our contract manufacturer may have purchased excess or obsolete inventory 
for example  in march we expensed million for excess inventory purchase commitments 
for those parts that are unique to our products  we could be required to pay for these excess or obsolete parts and recognize related inventory write offs 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturer may have an inadequate inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments which could negatively affect our net revenue in such periods 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses  experience product returns and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks 
while our products have been tested  because of their nature  they can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of voice or data traffic 
because of our short operating history  some of our products have not yet been broadly deployed 
consequently  our customers may discover errors or defects in our products after they have been broadly deployed 
for example  following deployment of our mbx product it was discovered that the mbx failed to meet all of its specified applications 
we have temporarily suspended deployment of the mbx 
the mbx is still available to customers that require only limited applications 
we are currently working to resolve the software issues and expect to begin reshipments of the mbx in our second quarter of however  we can give no assurances that we will meet this goal or that we will be able to resolve all the software issues and application deficiencies presented by the mbx 
failure to resolve the issues with our mbx product in a timely manner could result in the loss of customers and a decrease in net revenue and market share 
in addition  our customers may use our products in conjunction with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future  or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  could result in loss of customers or decrease in net revenue and market share 
we may be subject to significant liability claims because our products are used in connection with critical communications services 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims resulting from a defect in one of our products 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any of these claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and business 
we plan to invest a significant amount of our resources to fund the development  marketing and sale of our products 
however  if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing operations  we will not be able to generate additional sales 
we plan to incur significant amount of operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  expand our sales and marketing operations  broaden our customer support capabilities and develop new distribution channels 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated personnel requirements and net revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed 
in addition  we may be required to spend more for research and development than originally budgeted in order to respond to industry trends 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing net revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
our net revenue could decline significantly if our relationship with our major oem customer deteriorates 
a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from sales to lucent technologies  one of our oem customers 
our agreement with lucent is not exclusive and does not contain minimum volume commitments 
lucent technologies accounted for approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  our oem agreement with lucent expires in may  and we can give no assurances that we will be able to extend the term of our contract or enter into a new contract with lucent 
lucent may terminate the agreement earlier upon days notice 
at any time or after a short period of notice  lucent could elect to cease marketing and selling our products 
they may so elect for a number of reasons  including the acquisition by lucent of one or more of our competitors or their technologies  or because one or more of our competitors introduces superior or more cost effective products 
in addition  we intend to develop and market new products that may compete directly with the products of lucent  which may also harm our relationships with this customer 
for example  our multiservice broadband xchange  or mbx  product may compete with products offered by our oem customers  including lucent  which could adversely affect our relationship with that customer 
our existing relationship with lucent could make it harder for us to establish similar relationships with lucent s competitors 
any loss  reduction  delay or cancellation in expected sales to our oem customers  the inability to extend our contract or enter into a new contract with lucent on favorable terms  or our inability to establish similar relationships with new oem customers in the future  would hurt our business and our ability to increase net revenue and could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate significantly 
telecommunications networks are comprised of multiple hardware and software products from multiple vendors 
if our products are not compatible with other companies products within our customers networks  orders will be delayed or cancelled 
many of our customers require that our products be designed to work with their existing networks  each of which may have different specifications and utilize multiple protocols that govern the way devices on the network communicate with each other 
our customers networks may contain multiple generations of products from different vendors that have been added over time as their networks have grown and evolved 
our products may be required to work with these products as well as with future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our product designs to achieve a sale  which may result in a longer sales cycle  increased research and development expense  and reduced operating margins 
if our products are not compatible with existing equipment in our customers networks  whether open or proprietary  installations could be delayed  or orders for our products could be cancelled 
our failure to enhance our existing products or develop and introduce new products that meet changing customer requirements and technological advances would limit our ability to sell our products 
our ability to increase net revenue will depend significantly on whether we are able to anticipate or adapt to rapid technological innovation in the telecommunications industry and to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  products that meet changing customer demands and industry standards 
if the standards adopted are different from those which we have chosen to support  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed 
developing new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process and we may not have sufficient resources to successfully and accurately anticipate technological and market trends  or to successfully manage long development cycles 
we must manage the transition from our older products to new or enhanced products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of new products are available for delivery to meet anticipated customer demand 
any significant delay or failure to release new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis could harm our reputation and customer relationships  provide a competitor with a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
if we fail to win contracts at the beginning of our telecommunications customers deployment cycles  we may not be able to sell products to those customers for an extended period of time  which could inhibit our growth 
our existing and potential telecommunications customers generally select a limited number of suppliers at the beginning of a deployment cycle 
as a result  if we are not selected as one of these suppliers  we may not have an opportunity to sell products to that customer until its next purchase cycle  which may be an extended period of time 
in addition  if we fail to win contracts from existing and potential customers that are at an early stage in their design cycle  our ability to sell products to these customers in the future may be adversely affected because they may prefer to continue purchasing products from their existing vendor 
since we rely on a small number of customers for the majority of our sales  our failure to capitalize on limited opportunities to win contracts with these customers could severely harm us 
since the sales cycle for our products is typically long and unpredictable  we have difficulty predicting future net revenue and our net revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly 
a customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
our sales cycle varies from a few months to over a year 
as a result  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort without any assurance of a sale 
a long sales cycle also subjects us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and order reductions or cancellations 
even after deciding to purchase our products  our customers often deploy our products slowly 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
if we are unable to develop and maintain strategic relationships with vendors of emerging technologies  we may not be able to meet the changing needs of our customers 
our success will depend on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with vendors of emerging technologies 
we depend on these relationships for access to information on technical developments and specifications that we need to develop our products 
we also may not be able to predict which existing or potential partners will develop leading technologies or industry standards 
we may not be able to maintain or develop strategic relationships or replace strategic partners that we lose 
if we fail to develop or maintain strategic relationships with companies that develop necessary technologies or create industry standards  our products could become obsolete 
we could also be at a competitive disadvantage in attempting to negotiate relationships with those potential partners in the future 
in addition  if any strategic partner breaches or terminates its relationship with us  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
we depend upon a single contractor for most of our manufacturing needs 
termination of this relationship could impose significant costs on us and could harm or interfere with our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries 
we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and have generally relied primarily on a contract manufacturer  benchmark electronics  or benchmark  to build our products 
effective april   we transferred primary manufacturing responsibility of our products from flextronics international limited  or flextronics to benchmark 
under our agreement with benchmark  benchmark may cancel the contract on short notice and is not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on benchmark involves a number of risks  including the lack of operating history between us and benchmark  absence of control over our manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in  access to process technologies and reduced control over component availability  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
if our agreement or relationship with benchmark is terminated  we will not have a primary manufacturing contract with any third party 
we will have to immediately identify and qualify one or more acceptable alternative manufacturers  which could result in substantial manufacturing delays and cause us to incur significant costs 
it is possible that an alternate source may not be available to us when needed or be in a position to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and quality 
any significant interruption in manufacturing would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers  harm our reputation and could cause the loss of existing or potential customers  any of which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components 
if we are unable to buy components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers on time which could cause us to lose customers 
if we purchase excess components to reduce this risk  we may incur significant inventory costs 
we obtain several of the key components used in our products  including interface circuits  microprocessors  digital signal processors  digital subscriber line modules and flash memory  from single or limited sources of supply 
we have encountered  and expect in the future to encounter  difficulty in obtaining these components from our suppliers 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a severe shortage of components  particularly subscriber line interface circuits  which jeopardized our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion 
we purchase most components on a purchase order basis and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with most of our key suppliers 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components could limit the availability of these components to us at acceptable prices and on a timely basis  if at all 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or our inability to obtain these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers or force us to reengineer our products  which may hurt our gross margins and our ability to deliver products on a timely basis  if at all 
a substantial period of time could be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers  if available 
in addition  qualifying additional suppliers is time consuming and expensive and exposes us to potential supplier production difficulties or quality variations 
the telecommunications market is becoming increasingly global 
while we plan to expand internationally  we have limited experience operating in international markets 
in our efforts to expand internationally  we could become subject to new risks which could hamper our ability to establish and manage our international operations 
we have sales and customer support personnel covering the united kingdom and latin america and have initiated distribution relationships in europe 
we have limited experience in marketing and distributing our products internationally and in developing versions of our products that comply with local standards 
in addition  our international operations will be subject to other inherent risks  including o the failure to adopt regulatory changes that facilitate the provisioning of competitive communications services  o difficulties adhering to international protocol standards  o expenses associated with customizing products for other countries  o protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o difficulties enforcing agreements through other legal systems and in complying with foreign laws  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o political and economic instability  and o import or export licensing requirements 
the complex nature of our telecommunications products requires us to provide our customers with a high level of service and support by highly trained personnel 
if we do not expand our customer service and support organization  we will not be able to meet our customers demands 
we currently have a small customer service and support organization  and we will need to increase these resources to support any increase in the needs of our existing and new customers 
hiring customer service and support personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technologies 
if we are unable to expand or maintain our customer service and support organization  our customers may become dissatisfied and we could lose customers and our reputation could be harmed 
a reputation for poor service would prevent us from increasing sales to existing or new customers 
the competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in northern california 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of the principal members of our sales  marketing  engineering and management personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term  and we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
the competition for qualified personnel remains strong in our industry and in northern california  where there is a high concentration of established and emerging growth technology companies 
this competition makes it more difficult to retain our key personnel and to recruit new highly qualified personnel 
to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to existing shareholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses to attract and retain these individuals  which payments could harm our operating results 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel  we could face delays in developing our products and implementing our sales and marketing plans  and we may not be able to grow our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
failure to protect our intellectual property will limit our ability to compete and result in a loss of a competitive advantage and decreased net revenue 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially on our proprietary technology 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased net revenue 
we presently have four us patent applications pending  but no issued patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing copyright  trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use some technologies in the future 
our industry is characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties have asserted  and may assert in the future  patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies or rights that are important to our business 
in addition  our agreements may require that we indemnify our customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
these claims could cause us to stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property and could also result in product shipment delays or require us to redesign or modify our products or enter into licensing agreements 
these licensing agreements  if required  could increase our product costs and may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements 
from time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain necessary third party licenses may force us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  any of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
because our headquarters are located in northern california  which is a region containing active earthquake faults if a natural disaster occurs or the power energy crisis continues  our business could be shut down or severely impacted 
our business and operations depend on the extent to which our facility and products are protected against damage from fire  earthquakes  power loss and similar events 
despite precautions taken by us  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could  among other things  hinder our research and development efforts  delay the shipment of our products and affect our ability to receive and fulfill orders 
risks associated with the multiservice broadband access industry intense competition in the market for our telecommunications products could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our net revenue and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the market for multiservice broadband access products is highly competitive 
we compete directly with numerous companies  including accelerated networks  adtran  alcatel  carrier access  cisco systems  lucent technologies  siemens  zhone technologies and polycom 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  significantly greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial  customer support  professional services and other resources  including vendor sponsored financing programs 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products to leverage their customer bases and broaden product offerings to gain market share 
in addition  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments or achieve the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
in addition  due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources  including other large telecommunications equipment manufacturers  may enter our markets and further intensify competition 
we believe that our existing oem customers continuously evaluate whether to offer their own multiservice broadband access devices 
if our oem customers decide to internally design and sell their own multiservice broadband access devices  or acquire one or more of our competitors or their broadband access technologies  they could eliminate or substantially reduce their purchases of our products 
one of our oem customers  lucent technologies  accounted for approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  in addition  our current growth may cause our oem customers  including lucent  to view us as greater competition 
our oem relationships could also be harmed as we develop and market new products that may compete directly with the products of our oem customer 
for example  our mbx product may compete with products offered by lucent  which could adversely affect our relationship with that customer 
we cannot assure you that our oem customers will continue to rely  or expand their reliance  on us as an external source of supply for their multiservice broadband access devices 
because we rely on one oem customer for a substantial portion of our net revenue  a loss of sales to this oem customer could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because our industry is characterized by consolidation  we could potentially lose customers  which would harm our business 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation  as exemplified by the recent or pending acquisitions of sonoma systems by nortel networks  efficient networks by siemens and pairgain technologies by adc telecommunications 
we cannot predict how industry consolidation will affect our competitors and we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
our products are subject to price reduction and margin pressures 
if our average selling prices decline and we fail to offset that decline through cost reductions  our gross margins and potential profitability could be seriously harmed 
in the past  competitive pressures have forced us to reduce the prices of our products 
in the second quarter of  we reduced the price of our t integrator product  now known as the integrator  product in response to competition  which reduced our gross margins in subsequent periods 
we expect similar price reductions to occur in the future in response to competitive pressures 
in addition  our average selling prices decline when we negotiate volume price discounts with customers and utilize indirect distribution channels 
if our average selling prices decline and we fail to offset that decline through cost reductions  our gross margins and potential profitability would be seriously harmed 
sales of our products depend on the widespread adoption of multiservice broadband access services and if the demand for multiservice broadband access services does not develop  then our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
our business will be harmed if the demand for multiservice broadband access services does not increase as rapidly as we anticipate  or if our customers multiservice broadband access service offerings are not well received in the marketplace 
critical factors affecting the development of the multiservice broadband access services market include o the development of a viable business model for multiservice broadband access services  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain these services  o the ability of competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  to obtain sufficient funding and to successfully grow their businesses 
o cost constraints  such as installation  space and power requirements at the central offices of incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  o compatibility of equipment from multiple vendors in service provider networks  o evolving industry standards for transmission technologies and transport protocols  o varying and uncertain conditions of the communications network infrastructure  including quality and complexity  electrical interference  and crossover interference with voice and data telecommunications services  o domestic and foreign government regulation  and the market for multiservice broadband access devices may fail to develop for these or other reasons or may develop more slowly than anticipated  which could harm our business 
if we fail to comply with regulations and evolving industry standards  sales of our existing and future products could be harmed 
the markets for our products are characterized by a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
our customers may require our products to comply with various standards  including those promulgated by the federal communications commission  or fcc  standards established by underwriters laboratories and telcordia technologies or proprietary standards promoted by our competitors 
in addition  our key competitors may establish proprietary standards which they might not make available to us 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve compatibility with their products 
internationally  we may also be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
our customers are subject to government regulation  and changes in current or future laws or regulations that negatively impact our customers could harm our business 
the jurisdiction of the fcc extends to the entire communications industry  including our customers 
future fcc regulations affecting the broadband access industry  our customers or their service offerings may harm our business 
for example  fcc regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and internet services may impede our customers penetration into markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge 
in addition  international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards and regulations for the broadband access industry 
if our customers are hurt by laws or regulations regarding their business  products or service offerings  demand for our products may decrease 
additional risks that may affect our stock price we may engage in future acquisitions or strategic investments that we may not be able to successfully integrate or manage  which could hurt our business 
these acquisitions or strategic investments may also dilute our stockholders and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 
we may review acquisition prospects and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
for example  in february we acquired woodwind communications systems  inc  a provider of voice over broadband network edge access solutions  and in december we acquired certain assets of metrobility optical systems  inc  in both cases in exchange for shares of our common stock 
the issuance of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions or investments could significantly dilute our investors 
if we incur or assume debt in connection with future acquisitions or investments  we may incur interest charges that could increase our net loss 
we have little experience in evaluating  completing  managing or integrating acquisitions and strategic investments 
acquisitions and strategic investments may entail numerous integration risks and impose costs on us  including o difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies or products including the loss of key employees  o unanticipated costs  o diversion of management s attention from our core business concerns  o adverse effects on business relationships with our suppliers and customers or those of the acquired businesses  o risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  o assumption of contingent liabilities  o incurrence of significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets  and o incurrence of significant write offs 
our stock has traded at or below 
if the trading of our common stock falls below for an extended period  our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
our common stock has recently traded at or below 
since february   the closing bid price per share for our common stock has been below 
if our common stock fails to maintain nasdaq s minimum bid price closing requirement of and this failure continues ninety days  nasdaq may institute delisting proceedings 
if our stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  our stockholders would find it more difficult to dispose of  and obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of  their shares  and the market price of our stock would likely decline further 
we may need to raise more capital  but the availability of additional financing is uncertain 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could negatively impact our product development and sales 
in the quarter ended december  we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
if our capital requirements vary significantly from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of equity ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
in addition  holders of these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  we may incur significant interest charges  and these securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock 
the terms of these securities could also impose restrictions on our operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could negatively impact our product development and sales 
our stock price may be volatile  and you may not be able to resell our shares at or above the price you paid  or at all 
in august we completed our initial public offering 
prior to our initial public offering there had not been a public market for our common stock 
the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
the trading prices and valuations of many technology companies are substantially above historical levels 
these trading prices and valuations may not be sustainable 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
additional sales of our common stock in the public market after this offering  or the perception that such sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
many corporate actions would be controlled by officers  directors and affiliated entities  if they acted together  regardless of the desire of other investors to pursue an alternative course of action 
as of december   our directors  executive officers and their affiliated entities beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock after giving affect to the stockholders rights agreement executed by jeffrey drazan and certain entities affiliated with sierra ventures 
these stockholders  if they acted together  could exert control over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company  which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company and might reduce our stock price 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other stockholders  including those who purchase shares in this offering 
delaware law  our corporate charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan contain anti takeover provisions that would delay or discourage take over attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include o the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors  o the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  o the establishment of a classified board of directors  o the ability of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to five million shares of preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors which rights could be senior to those of common stock  and o the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent 
each of these provisions could discourage potential take over attempts and could lower the market price of our common stock 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of august  each right  when exercisable  entitles the registered holder to purchase from vina one one thousandth of a share of a new series of preferred stock  designated as series a participating preferred stock  at a price of per one one thousandth of a share  subject to adjustment 
the rights will generally separate from the common stock and become exercisable if any person or group acquires or announces a tender offer to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock without the consent of our board of directors 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations 
for  our investments in commercial paper and debt obligations were subject to interest rate risk  but due to the short term nature of these investments  interest rate changes did not have a material impact on their value in we have no investment in commercial paper or debt obligation as of december  to date  our international sales have been primarily denominated in us dollars and accordingly  a hypothetical change of in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or the results of operations 
the functional currency of our subsidiary in the united kingdom is the us dollar and  as the local accounts are maintained in british pounds  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with remeasurement to us dollars 
a hypothetical change of in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or the results of operations
