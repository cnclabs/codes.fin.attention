overview precise is a provider of software that assists organizations in monitoring and optimizing the performance of their complex information technology infrastructure 
we were incorporated in november initially  we focused on developing and marketing performance management software for mainframe computer systems 
in  we shifted our focus to application performance management software for oracle database environments 
in  we released the initial version of our precise sql software  now called precise indepth for oracle  for database monitoring 
since  we have released or acquired new products and continually updated our product suite making the following products generally available release product precise pulse  precise presto for emc  precise interpoint precise insight  precise savant precise foresight  precise indepth for jee  precise savvy for oracle  web  jee  sap r  bea tuxedo  and siebel  precise indepth for db udb  precise crosspoint  precise storage central srm  precise i suite in september  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of w 
quinn associates  inc w 
quinn for approximately million in a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
we issued  ordinary shares and paid million in cash for the acquisition  which included million in transaction costs 
in addition  w 
quinn shareholders received the right to receive additional ordinary shares in an amount up to million  based on achievement of certain post acquisition revenue and performance targets relating to the one year period subsequent to closing 
the business combination has been accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the fair value of the tangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
of the total purchase price  which included direct acquisition costs  million was allocated to goodwill  representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets assumed  million was allocated to acquired technology  million was allocated to acquired patents  million was allocated to trademarks and customer relationships  and a one time charge of approximately  was charged on our statement of operations for acquired in process research and development in september in december  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of savant corporation for million in a combination of cash and ordinary shares

in february  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of knight fisk software ltd  or knight fisk  our uk based distributor  for cash and options to purchase our ordinary shares 
the business combination has been accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the fair value of the tangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
of the total purchase price  approximately million was allocated to goodwill  representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net liabilities assumed 
prior to the knight fisk acquisition  we sold our products to knight fisk at discounts of up to off our list price and we recognized revenues based on our sales to knight fisk at these discounted prices 
knight fisk  in turn  would resell these products to third party end users and recognize revenues based on these sales 
since knight fisk is now our uk subsidiary  we recognize revenues on knight fisk sales to third party end users based on the actual price of the products sold by knight fisk  as required by principles of consolidation  rather than based on our sales to knight fisk at a discounted price 
as a result  our total revenues from the uk have increased 
our operating expenses in the uk have increased due to the knight fisk acquisition 
our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report  are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain  if required  additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is a policy that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses and from services 
our products are sold worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect sales channels  including original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and resellers 
our services revenues consist primarily of fees derived from annual maintenance and support agreements and consulting and training  none of which are considered essential to the functionality of the software license 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which summarizes the views of the staff of the us securities and exchange commission in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
generally revenues from our oems are recognized when we receive reports of fees due upon the sublicensing of our products by the oems 
software license revenues on sales to resellers and end users are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  all license payments are due within one year  vendor specific objective evidence exists  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
maintenance related service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which is typically one year 
consulting and training revenues are recognized after the services are rendered 
where software arrangements involve multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the relative fair values of each element in the arrangement in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop our vsoe used to allocate the sales price to training and maintenance is based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
license revenues are recorded based on the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements when there is vsoe of the fair values of all the undelivered elements and all revenue recognition criteria of sop  as amended  are satisfied 
under the residual method of accounting any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered elements 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any subsequent reporting period could be adversely affected 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill associated with the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other intangible assets  such as trademarks and trade names  favorable leases  and covenants not to compete are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
these assets will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of the non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangible assets 
we have adopted sfas no 
for the w 
quinn associates  inc acquisition in september  and have not amortized the associated goodwill for we plan to adopt these pronouncements related to acquisitions that occurred prior to june at such time as the amortization associated with purchased goodwill will cease 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
marketable securities 
we account for investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we determine the proper classification of investments in obligations with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
at december   most securities were designated as available for sale with a small portion classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the available for sale securities are stated at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of shareholders equity  accumulated other comprehensive income 
amortization of premium and accretion of discounts are included in financial income and other  net 
realized gains and losses on sales of all investments  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
our trading securities are carried at their fair value based upon the quoted market price of those investments 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in financial income and other  net 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
precise s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  without limitation  those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating precise and its business 
risks related to our business because of the significant purchase price of our software products and the corresponding care that our potential customers exercise in making a purchase decision  we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to fluctuate and this could cause the trading price of our shares to fluctuate or decline 
like many software and technology related companies  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past 
because of the significant purchase price of our software products  our customers exercise care in making a purchase decision 
we believe that this caution  in combination with the other factors listed below  exposes us to larger variability in quarterly operating results relative to other software or technology companies 
since our operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely upon our results in any one quarter as an indicator of our future performance 
if our quarterly revenues and operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our ordinary shares could fall substantially 
our operating results vary depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  including o varying budgeting cycles and available funds of our customers and potential customers  o the length and variability of our sales cycle  o varying size  timing and contractual terms of enterprise wide orders for our software  o changes in demand for oracle and other databases  with which our software operates  and related enterprise application software  o acceptance of new products in the marketplace  o seasonality in our revenues  which have been lower historically in the first and third quarters  o changes in gross margins resulting from the mix of us vs 
international sales or license sales vs 
services  o software defects and other product quality problems that may not become known until customer trials or after installation  o changes in gross margins depending on whether our software is sold directly or through indirect sales channels  and o the revenue performance of third party sales channels 
in addition  a significant portion of our software license revenues in any quarter is often derived from orders booked and shipped in the last weeks or days of that quarter 
a delay in an order  even from just one customer  could negatively impact our quarterly revenues and operating results 
a substantial portion of our expenses  including most software development and sales and marketing expenses  must be incurred in advance of generating revenues 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed 
as a result  if our projected revenues do not meet our expectations  for the reasons above or for any other reasons  then we will still incur these fixed expenses and are likely to experience an even larger shortfall in our quarterly operating results relative to expectations 
we have a history of losses  and we anticipate our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as a result of planned expansion of our sales and marketing channels and research and development activities  which could delay us from attaining profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and had net income of  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot predict the extent of our future losses and when  or if  we may become profitable on a sustained basis 
we anticipate that our expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we seek to expand our distribution channels  to increase our sales and marketing activities  and to continue to develop our technology and introduce new software 
these efforts may prove more costly than we currently anticipate and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses 
if we fail to increase our revenues at a greater rate than our expenses  we will not be able to maintain profitability 
our inability to dedicate appropriate financial and managerial resources could impair our ability to grow our revenues at the same rate in the future as they have in the past and  for the same reason  they could decline 
although our revenues have grown at substantial rates in recent years  we do not expect our revenues to grow as rapidly in the future  and our revenues could decline 
our total revenues have grown from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  and to million for the year ended december  as our business develops and the market for our software products matures  it is unlikely that our revenues will continue to grow at the same rapid pace 
we may not be able to dedicate the significant managerial time and effort required to develop additional strategic relationships  and we may not be able to hire sufficient numbers of sales personnel to expand our sales channels and increase penetration of our existing markets 
in addition  we may not have the financial liquidity required to develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
our failure to dedicate appropriate resources to our business could strain our existing systems or management capabilities  limit our growth and harm our business and financial performance 
we currently have employees based in israel  the united kingdom  france  holland  germany  australia  canada  china  malaysia and throughout the united states 
we increased our employee base significantly during and in particular  we have increased  and expect to continue to increase  the size of our sales force through the integration of the operations of knight fisk software ltd  which we acquired in february  savant corporation  which we acquired in december  jc informatique  the workforce and assets of which we acquired in december and w 
quinn associates  inc  which we acquired in september furthermore  we have recently established subsidiaries and joint ventures in europe and expect to continue to establish additional distribution channels through third party relationships 
our growth  coupled with rapid changes in our market  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on our administrative  operational and financial resources and places significant demands on our internal systems  procedures and controls 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems and controls 
the failure to invest in and establish systems with sufficient capacity to handle expanded operations or failure to dedicate appropriate managerial resources could restrain our potential future growth and may harm the efficiency of our operations 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  the quality of our products and services and our operating results could be seriously harmed 
we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced sales  marketing  research and development  customer support and management personnel 
if we do not attract and retain such personnel  we may not be able to expand our sales coverage or develop and introduce new or enhanced products on the scale and schedule that we intend 
competition for qualified personnel in the computer software industry is intense  especially for technical personnel 
we have experienced difficulty in the past recruiting qualified personnel  especially technical and sales personnel 
moreover  we intend to expand the scope of our international operations and these plans will require us to hire experienced management  service  marketing  sales and customer support personnel abroad 
we expect competition for qualified personnel to remain intense and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining these personnel 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products  which in turn requires significant resources and management attention 
there is a risk that even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we will not be successful in our efforts 
our costs of doing business would increase without the expected increase in revenues 
our inability to recruit  hire  train and retain qualified employees could cause our business to suffer 
any acquisitions or attempted acquisitions will divert management attention and financial resources and may harm our results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to consider acquiring complementary technologies  products and businesses 
attempted acquisitions may divert management  operational and financial resources from the conduct of our core business 
as a result  if we pursue this growth strategy  the efforts of management will be diverted from their other operational responsibilities  and we may not complete any attempted acquisition 
if we use capital stock  our existing shareholders may experience dilution 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced  the holders of our debt would have claims on our assets ahead of holders of our ordinary shares and our business operations may be restricted by the terms of any debt  including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
in addition  an acquisition may involve nonrecurring charges or amortization of significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which would adversely affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
acquisitions may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated and may cause our revenues to decline 
the acquisition of savant  w 
quinn and any other past or future acquisitions may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and acquired businesses or technologies may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including o difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  o risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  o potential loss of key employees of the acquired entity  and o expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company 
in addition  management s attention and resources may be diverted during any attempted integration 
any one or a combination of these factors may cause our revenues or earnings to decline 
we depend upon key personnel  the loss of whom would harm our operations 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued performance and services of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing  engineering and support personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key personnel  including shimon alon  our chief executive officer  and itzhak aki ratner  our president  would be disruptive to our operations 
it would be difficult and time consuming to replace them 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our officers 
any of these individuals may voluntarily terminate his employment with precise 
our inability to retain these employees could harm the growth and success of our business 
we compete with oracle  a company with long standing relationships with our customers  efforts by oracle to improve their competitive position could reduce our revenues or gross margins we face both current and potential competition from oracle 
our precise indepth for oracle software presently competes with a product sold by oracle in the market for information technology infrastructure performance management software 
as part of its competitive strategy  oracle could attempt to increase its presence in this market by focusing its efforts on selling its own performance management software to our present and potential customers 
in addition  oracle could bundle its own performance management software  or performance management software offered by a third party  with its database software  which could discourage potential customers from purchasing our software 
even if the performance management software sold by oracle or bundled with oracle s database software was more limited in functionality than our software  a significant number of customers or potential customers might elect to accept more limited functionality instead of purchasing additional software from us 
although to date we have not experienced pressure to reduce prices or margins as a result of oracle bundling performance management software with their database software  this bundling practice could lead to future price reductions for our software  reducing our gross margins 
oracle has a longer operating history  a larger installed base of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do 
if any of those events occurred  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired  and we would lose market share 
our relationship with oracle is important to our software development efforts and any deterioration in this relationship could impair our ability to develop our software related to oracle products 
we rely on our participation in oracle s testing and feedback programs to develop our technology and enhance the features and functionality of our software on a timely basis to coincide with the release of new software or software enhancements from oracle 
any deterioration of our relationship with oracle could delay development or introduction of our new or enhanced software 
this would adversely affect our competitive position 
we do not have any agreements to ensure that our existing relationship with oracle will continue 
traditionally  oracle has not prohibited companies who develop software that supports oracle products from participating in these programs 
however  if oracle were to prohibit us from participating in these programs in the future for competitive or other reasons  our inability to respond to any changes in oracle products could result in shipment delays or lost revenues 
if the markets for oracle databases and related applications software do not continue to expand  our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected 
to date  most of the precise software has been designed to support oracle based it infrastructures  although we have introduced new products and expect to continue to develop new products which are designed for databases marketed by other software providers  or are not dependent on databases 
if the market for oracle databases and related applications software declines or expands more slowly than we currently anticipate  our ability to grow our business  sell our software and achieve and maintain profitability may be impaired 
although the market for oracle databases and related applications has grown rapidly  this growth may not continue at the same rate  or at all 
the application performance management software market is expected to rapidly evolve  and if we are not able to accurately predict and respond to market developments or customer needs  our competitive position will be impaired 
the market for it application performance management software is relatively new and is expected to evolve rapidly 
however  estimates of our market s expected growth are inherently uncertain and are subject to many risks and assumptions 
moreover  many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans 
these customers look to our software products to monitor application performance in this environment 
rapid changes in the needs of these customers and changing technologies make it difficult for us to predict their demands 
we are particularly susceptible to those changes since our software is used in a wide array of operating environments  which are constantly evolving 
as a result  we may not be able to develop  on a timely basis or at all  software that meets our customers needs or desires 
in addition  various sectors of our market are served by competitors who may respond more effectively to market developments and customer needs 
we cannot assure you that the market for our software will grow or that we will be able to respond to changes in the market  evolving customer needs or our competition 
if the market for our software does not develop as we expect or if we fail to respond to market and competitive developments  our business prospects and competitive position will be impaired 
the failure of our new software to achieve market acceptance or delays in our current or future software development efforts could erode our competitive position 
the failure to successfully develop  enhance or modify our software  or the failure to do so on a timely basis  could limit our revenue growth and competitive position 
we expanded our product line to allow the monitoring of an organization s application performance across the it infrastructure and continue to develop new releases of our core products that incorporate additional features 
we may need to rapidly develop and introduce additional software and enhancements to our existing software to satisfy our current customers and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace 
we may also need to modify our software so that it can operate with new or enhanced software introduced by other software vendors 
the failure to introduce new  enhanced or modified software on a timely basis could prevent our software from achieving market acceptance 
we have in the past  and may in the future  experience delays in the timing of new software introductions 
to support our software development  enhancement or modification  we may find it necessary to license or acquire new technologies  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to establish and effectively manage indirect distribution channels could cause our revenues to decline 
our ability to sell our software in new markets and to increase our share of existing markets will be impaired if we fail to expand significantly our indirect distribution channels 
our sales strategy involves the establishment of multiple distribution channels domestically and internationally through value added resellers  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
we have entered into agreements with emc  amdocs  and several other companies to bundle a version of our software or to sell our software along with their product 
although these relationships have been successful to date  we cannot predict the extent to which these companies will continue to be successful in marketing or selling our software 
these agreements could be terminated on short notice and they do not prevent any of these parties from selling the software of other companies  including our competitors 
our oems or resellers could give higher priority to other companies software or to their own software than they give to ours 
our inability to develop and expand our direct sales force would limit our revenue growth 
if we do not expand and retain our direct sales force  revenue growth could be seriously harmed 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain as many qualified individuals as we may require in the future 
to the extent we hire personnel from competitors  we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 
in addition  sale of our software requires sales personnel  experienced in our market  who target and gain access to the senior management of our prospective customers 
newly hired sales personnel require extensive training and may take six months or longer to achieve full productivity 
this training period  along with the difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified individuals  makes it difficult to grow the size of our sales force rapidly and utilize them effectively 
a decline in the price of or demand for our precise indepth for oracle software  which accounts for a substantial portion of our total revenues  would cause a significant decline in our revenues 
our success depends on continued market acceptance of our precise indepth for oracle software 
revenues from licensing precise indepth for oracle accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december   of our total revenues for the year ended december   and of our total revenues for the year ended december  we expect software license revenues from precise indepth for oracle to continue to account for a substantial portion of our future revenues  although we expect this percentage to continue to decline 
for instance  for the three months ended december   precise indepth for oracle accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
if precise indepth for oracle does not continue to achieve market acceptance  or if our competitors release new products that have more advanced features  offer better performance or are more price competitive than precise indepth for oracle  our revenues may not grow and may even decline 
if existing customers do not make subsequent purchases from us or if our relationships with our largest customers are impaired  our revenue growth could decline 
our revenue growth could decline if our current customers do not purchase additional licenses from us 
as we deploy new versions of our existing software or introduce new software  our current customers may not require the functionality of this new software and may not license it 
we also depend on our installed customer base for future service revenue from maintenance renewal fees 
the terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of software maintenance 
our maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of our customers but there are no obligations to renew 
if customers choose not to continue their maintenance service  our revenues may decline 
in addition  our strategic channel represents a large portion of our total revenues 
these revenues are derived from emc  amdocs and  to a lesser extent  other strategic partners 
if our sales from these customers were impaired  our revenue growth could decline 
defects in our software would harm our business and divert resources 
because our software is complex  it may contain errors that can be detected at any point in its life cycle 
any errors or defects in our software could result in o delayed or lost revenue  o failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  o claims against us  o diversion of development resources  o increased service  warranty and insurance costs  and o negative publicity resulting in damage to our reputation 
while we continually test our software for errors and work with customers to identify and correct them  errors in our software may be found in the future 
testing for errors is complicated because it is difficult to simulate the breadth of operating systems  user applications and computing environments that our customers use and because our software is becoming increasingly complex itself 
the costs we may incur in addressing software errors could be substantial 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs to us 
because our customers rely on our software to monitor and improve the performance of their critical software applications  they are sensitive to potential disruptions that may be caused by the use of  or any defects in  our software 
as a result  we may be subject to claims for damages related to software errors in the future 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
regardless of whether we prevail  diversion of key employees time and attention from the business  incurrence of substantial expenses and potential damage to our reputation might result 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
limitation of liability provisions like those in our license agreements  however  may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions 
in addition  although we maintain general liability insurance  we cannot assure you that this coverage will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive market position 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  consisting primarily of computer programs and instructions stored on digital media that can be easily reproduced 
if we are unable to protect that technology  our market position will be harmed 
other than our trademarks  most of our intellectual property consists of proprietary or confidential information that is not subject to patent or similar protection 
unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the technology protected by those rights 
furthermore  policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult and costly  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us if competitors or potential customers are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively would be harmed 
we have placed  and in the future may place  source code for our software in escrow 
the source code may  under certain circumstances  be made available to certain of our customers 
this may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our software 
claims that our software infringes the proprietary rights of others could harm our business and cause us to incur significant costs 
software products are increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
as a result  third parties may claim that our software infringes on their proprietary rights 
the application of patent law to the software industry is particularly uncertain as the us patent and trademark office has only recently begun to issue software patents in large numbers 
any potential intellectual property claims against us  with or without merit  could o be expensive and time consuming to defend  o cause us to cease making  licensing or using software that incorporates the challenged intellectual property  o cause software shipment and installation delays  o require us to redesign our software  if feasible  o divert management s attention and resources  or o require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product or component 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim of software infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could prevent us from distributing our software or cause us to incur great expense and delay in developing non infringing software 
we rely on software licenses from third parties  the loss of which could increase our costs and delay software shipments 
we integrate various third party software products as components of our software 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our software shipments 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 
we are subject to risks of operating worldwide that could impair our ability to grow our revenues abroad 
we market and sell our software in north america  south america  europe and asia and we plan to establish additional facilities in these and other parts of the world 
therefore  we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations 
sales to customers located outside of north america accounted for approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december  and approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december  in addition  our largest research and development facility is located in israel 
the expansion of our existing operations and entry into additional worldwide markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we are also subject to a number of risks customary for worldwide operations  including o economic or political instability in worldwide markets  o greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  o import and export controls  o the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures  and o foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  a substantial portion of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  and we have not used risk management techniques or hedged the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the future  if we do not engage in hedging transactions  our results of operations will be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our share price has been volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the price at which our ordinary shares trade has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of securities  particularly securities of technology and computer software companies 
as a result  investors may experience a significant decline in the market price of our ordinary shares  regardless of our operating performance 
price declines in our stock could result from many factors outside of our control  including o announcements by our competitors of financial results  acquisitions  new products or technological innovations  o disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  o conditions in israel  and o general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type  regardless of its merit  is often extremely expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
risks related to our operations in israel potential political  economic and military instability in israel may harm our results of operations 
our largest research and development facility is located in israel and a small portion of our sales is currently being made to customers in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect our business 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors as well as many incidents of civil unrest 
any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could adversely affect our operations 
despite the efforts towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors and the palestinians  there can be no assurance that ongoing or revived hostilities or other factors related to israel will not harm our business 
furthermore  several countries still restrict business with israel and israeli companies 
these restrictive laws and policies may seriously limit our ability to operate in israel or sell our software in these countries and would harm our results of operations 
our operations may be negatively affected by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service 
many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform military reserve duty 
in addition  in the event of a war  military or other conflict  individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time 
our operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of time of one or more of our key employees or a significant number of our other employees due to military service 
any such disruption in our operations could harm our operations 
because most of our revenues are generated in non israeli currencies  but a portion of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels  inflation and currency fluctuations could seriously harm our results of operations 
we generate most of our revenues in us dollars but a portion of our costs associated with our israeli operations is in new israeli shekels  or nis 
we also pay some of our international based sales and support staff in local currencies  such as the british pound sterling 
as a result  we are exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in israel or in the uk exceeds the rate of devaluation of the nis or the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags behind inflation in israel or in the uk in that event  the cost of our operations in israel and the uk measured in terms of uk dollars will increase and our uk dollar measured results of operations will suffer 
historically  israel has experienced periods of high inflation 
our results of operations also could be harmed if we are unable to guard against currency fluctuations in israel  the uk or other countries in which we may employ sales or support staff in the future 
you may have difficulties in enforcing a us judgment against us  our executive officers and directors or in asserting us securities laws claims in israel 
because a significant portion of our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the united states  a judgment obtained in the united states against us or any of them may not be collectible in the united states and may not be enforced by an israeli court 
further  if a foreign judgment is enforced by an israeli court  it will be payable in israeli currency 
we intend to rely upon tax benefits from the state of israel if and when we become profitable  but those tax benefits may not be available to us at that time 
we are eligible for certain tax benefits for the first several years in which we generate taxable income pursuant to israel s law for the encouragement of capital investments  although  we have not historically generated taxable income for purposes of this law  we may utilize these tax benefits beginning in our financial condition could suffer if these tax benefits were subsequently reduced or not available to us 
in order to receive tax benefits  we must comply with two material conditions 
we must have a certain amount of investments in fixed assets and must finance a portion of these investments with proceeds of equity capital raised by precise 
we believe we have complied with these conditions  but we have not received confirmation from the investment center with respect to our compliance 
if we fail to comply in whole or in part with these conditions  the tax benefits that we expect to receive could be partially or fully canceled 
in that event  we could be forced to refund the amount of the benefits we have received  adjusted for inflation and interest 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the benefits available under the approved enterprise program 
thus  these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
additionally  in the event that we increase our activities outside the state of israel due to  for example  future acquisitions  our increased activities generally will not be eligible for inclusion in israeli tax benefit programs 
accordingly  our effective corporate tax rate could increase significantly in the future as the revenues generated by the new activities will not qualify for approved enterprise treatment 
the transfer and use of portions of our technology are limited because of research and development grants we received from the israeli government 
our research and development efforts associated with the development of precise indepth for oracle software have been partially financed through grants from the office of the chief scientist of the israeli ministry of industry and commerce 
we have developed software through chief scientist grants that subject us to royalty payments and restrictions  which could limit or prevent our growth and profitability 
the software developed with this funding may not be manufactured  nor may this technology embodied in our software be transferred  outside of israel without appropriate governmental approvals 
these restrictions do not apply to the sale or export from israel of our software developed with this know how 
these restrictions will continue to apply to us after we pay the full amount of royalties payable in respect of the grants 
however  if the chief scientist consents to the manufacture of our software outside israel  the regulations prescribe the payment of increased royalties  ranging from to of the amount of the chief scientist grant  depending on the percentage of foreign manufacture 
provisions of israeli law may delay  prevent or make difficult an acquisition of precise  which could prevent a change of control and therefore depress the price of our shares 
provisions of israeli corporate and tax law may have the effect of delaying  preventing or making more difficult a merger or other acquisition of precise 
the new israeli companies law generally requires that a merger must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares present and voting on the proposed merger  excluding shares held by the potential acquiror  at a shareholders meeting that has been called on at least days advance notice 
any creditor of a merger party may seek a court order blocking the merger  if there is a reasonable concern that the surviving company will not be able to satisfy all of the obligations of the parties to the merger 
moreover  a merger may not be consummated until at least days have passed from the time that the merger proposal has been filed with the israeli registrar of companies 
other potential means of acquiring a public israeli company such as precise might involve significant obstacles  such as a requirement of court approval of the acquisition or business combination under certain circumstances 
israeli tax law treats some acquisitions  particularly stock for stock exchanges between an israeli company and a foreign company  less favorably than united states tax law 
israeli tax law will  for instance  subject a shareholder who is subject to israeli taxation and who exchanges his or her precise shares for shares in another corporation to immediate israeli taxation 
us investors in our company could suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company 
if  for any taxable year  our passive income or our assets that produce passive income exceed levels provided by law  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes 
this characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to our shareholders 
us shareholders should consult with their own us tax advisors with respect to the us tax consequences of investing in our ordinary shares

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
our investment portfolio includes debt instruments that are united states government obligations 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we do not engage in currency hedging activities and hold no foreign currency related derivative instruments that would subject our financial condition or results of operations to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we do  however  incur a portion of our expenditures in foreign currencies  such as nis  the euro and british pound sterling that could cause our results of operations to fluctuate
