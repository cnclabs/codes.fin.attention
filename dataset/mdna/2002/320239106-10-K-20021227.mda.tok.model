item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the information presented in the following discussion of financial results of first financial is largely indicative of the activities of its operating subsidiary  first federal  which comprises the substantial majority of the consolidated net income  revenues and assets of the company 
during the year ended september   the company consolidated its previously owned subsidiary  peoples federal into first federal 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data contained in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item of this report 
first financial achieved earnings of million in fiscal  increasing from million in fiscal basic and diluted earnings per share in improved to and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  in net income was million in basic and diluted earnings per share totaled and in  respectively 
net earnings resulted in a return on average equity of  and for the three years ended september   respectively 
the return on average assets for the three years ended september  was  
and  respectively 
first financial s earnings increased in fiscal due to several factors 
first  the company s net interest margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal  leading to a million increase in net interest income 
secondly  non interest revenues increased million  or  over fiscal due principally to growth in revenues from insurance services  banking fees and increased loan sales 
offsetting these increases was an million increase in non interest expense  due principally to additional insurance operations acquired and normal growth due to the level of business activity 
first financial s net income increased million in fiscal  or approximately  over fiscal growth in net income was principally attributable to expansion of net interest income  as average net interest margins increased substantially 
another important factor in fiscal was the million  or  increase in non interest revenues over fiscal on september   first financial announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of first financial s common stock 
approximately  shares were repurchased under the program in fiscal with a total of approximately  shares purchased under the plan since its inception 
the plan expired on september  the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program on october  to acquire up to  shares  or  of the company s common stock 
critical accounting policy first financial s accounting policies are discussed in item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
of these significant accounting policies  first financial considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses the allowance to be its most critical accounting policy since it requires a significant degree of management judgment 
first financial has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the company s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers  which is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
for additional discussion concerning the company s allowance and related matters  see financial position allowance for loan losses 
acquisitions during fiscal  first financial acquired johnson insurance associates  inc johnson insurance  a full service independent insurance agency located in columbia  south carolina  specializing primarily in commercial insurance lines 
the company also acquired benefit administrators  inc benefit administrators  an affiliated company providing third party administrative services for self insured health insurance plans 
this acquisition occurred on august  this transaction was accounted for as a purchase of stock with months of johnson insurance s operations included in fiscal results 
on may   the company acquired the hilton head  bluffton and ridgeland operations of the kinghorn insurance agency  a full service independent insurance agency specializing primarily in retail insurance lines 
these operations are included under kinghorn insurance services  inc kinghorn  a subsidiary of first southeast insurance services 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets with four months of kinghorn s operations included in fiscal results 
during fiscal  first financial acquired the operations of associated insurors  inc of myrtle beach  south carolina associated insurors  a full service insurance agency  specializing in commercial insurance lines 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets with four months of operations included in fiscal results 
one of the stated long term objectives of the company is diversification of its revenue sources 
increasingly  the company has sought to achieve this objective through either the purchase of insurance agencies or assets of insurance agencies 
the company also believes these acquisitions present significant cross sales opportunities and provide the company with the ability to offer an expanded menu of products to customers 
national and economic events as fiscal began  the nation was in a recession 
the federal reserve open market committee fomc cut interest rates during the first quarter  reducing the federal funds rate to by december  this cut was the last of rate cuts by the fmoc after the longest peacetime economic expansion in united states history came to an end in fiscal the uncertainty surrounding the terrorist attacks of september  likely resulted in prolonging the nation s recession for several more months 
the extent and duration of the economic impact from the attacks are not quantifiable but likely have affected consumer confidence and the financial activities of retail and business customers during fiscal as a response to protecting the country from terrorist activities  the nation also experienced increased deployment of the military as a deterrent to future terrorist activities 
during fiscal  the national economy continued to experience very slow levels of growth in a number of key economic indicators amid these national events 
recently  in november the fomc reduced the fed funds rate another basis points to 
rates are now at historically low levels 
during the year the economy was also affected by another months of lower returns and expectations of the equity markets 
the company believes lower short term interest rates in fiscal had a positive effect on reductions in the average cost of funds 
the shape of the yield curve  recovering significantly from the flat to inverted curve during a substantial portion of fiscal  also benefited the company s net interest margins 
management continues to believe that first financial s markets generally have performed better than national markets  including times of recession 
financial position at september   first financial s assets totaled billion  declining slightly  by  or million  from september  the decline in assets was principally attributable to declines of million in mortgage backed securities  million in cash and cash equivalents and million in net loans receivable offset partially by growth of million in loans held for sale 
average assets decreased 
during the year and average interest earning assets decreased by 
lower market interest rates in fiscal led to increased fixed rate residential loan originations 
agency qualifying fixed rate mortgage loan originations are normally sold by the company  increasing loans sales substantially in fiscal as deposit inflows also improved  the company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources  leading to a net reduction in borrowings of million  or  during fiscal at september   first financial s assets also totaled billion  increasing  or million  from september  net asset growth was principally attributable to growth in net loans receivable  which increased million during  and growth in cash and cash equivalents of million 
average interest earning assets increased by in borrowings also were reduced in fiscal by million due to better deposit cash flows 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities at september   available for sale securities totaled million compared to million at september  as market interest rates declined in fiscal  prepayment of the mortgage backed securities portfolio increased dramatically 
the primary objective of the company in its management of the investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality  highly liquid investments with returns competitive with short term us treasury or agency securities and highly rated corporate securities 
the association is required to maintain an adequate amount of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations 
the association has maintained balances in short term investments and mortgage backed securities based on a continuing assessment of cash flows  the level of loan production  current interest rate risk strategies and the assessment of the potential direction of market interest rate changes 
loans receivable loans comprise the major portion of interest earning assets of the company  accounting for and of average interest earning assets in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
compared with balances on september   net loans receivable declined slightly during fiscal loans held for sale increased million to million at september  real estate loan originations were higher in fiscal than in fiscal due principally to the effect of lower market interest rates 
loan growth  however  slowed due to more sales of agency qualifying residential loans 
during fiscal  the company s loan portfolio grew by 
consumer loans grew to million at september   increasing million  or from september  the company s manufactured housing portfolio increased million  or  during fiscal the company s home equity loan balances also increased million  or  in fiscal commercial loans increased million  or during the fiscal year ended september  the company continues to emphasize growth in consumer lending and commercial business lending 
the company s loan portfolio consists of real estate mortgage and construction loans  home equity  mobile home and other consumer loans  credit card receivables and commercial business loans 
the company believes the change in percentages of consumer and commercial loans and a lower percentage of single family mortgage loans has had a positive effect of the overall yield of the loan portfolio 
however  these loans generally have higher credit risks than single family residential loans  another factor in the growth in consumer loan net charge offs during recent years 
asset quality the company believes it maintains a conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix as well as its underwriting guidelines 
the company also maintains loan quality monitoring policies and systems that require detailed monthly and quarterly analyses of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
reports of such loans and assets by various categories are reviewed by management and the board of directors of the association 
the majority of the company s loan originations are in coastal south carolina and north carolina and inland in florence  south carolina 
the largest component of loan growth during fiscal has been in consumer loans 
the largest percentage increase in loan growth was attributable to commercial business loans 
both of these categories of loans are expected to have higher charge off rates than generally experienced with residential loans 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accruing when uncertainty exists about the ultimate collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
the company closely monitors trends in problem assets which include non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  renegotiated loans  and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
renegotiated loans are those loans on which the company has agreed to modifications of the terms of the loan such as changes in the interest rate charged and or other concessions 
the following table illustrates trends in problem assets and other asset quality indicators over the past five years 
problem assets at september  dollar amounts in thousands non accrual loans      accruing loans days or more delinquent renegotiated loans     real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans  as a percent of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans as a percent of total assets allowance for loan losses as a percent of problem loans net charge offs to average loans outstanding problem assets were million at september   or 
of assets and 
of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
at september   problem assets were million  or 
of assets and 
of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
loans on non accrual increased to million at september  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily related to an increase in more severely delinquent residential mortgage and consumer loans 
renegotiated loans declined by million in fiscal to thousand 
the company negotiated with the borrowers to accept a discounted payoff of two long term problem credits 
real estate and other assets in settlement of loans declined to million from million at september  management s long term goals continue to include lower ratios of problem assets to total assets  although management expects there will always remain a core level of delinquent loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans from normal lending operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each reporting date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance no less frequently than each quarter  utilizing its internal portfolio analysis system 
the factors that are considered in a determination of the level of the allowance are management s assessment of current economic conditions  the composition of the loan portfolio  previous loss experience on certain types of credit  a review of specific high risk sectors of the loan portfolio  selected individual loans and concentrations of credit 
the value of the underlying collateral is also considered during such reviews 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and an unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for loans is based principally on current loan grades and historical loss rates 
for consumer loans  it is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
the unallocated component of the allowance represents the results of analyses that estimate probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance 
these analyses include industry concentrations  model imprecision and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on historical loss rates 
we continually monitor trends in loan portfolio qualitative and quantitative factors  including trends in the levels of past due  criticized and nonperforming loans 
the trends in these factors are used to evaluate the reasonableness of the unallocated component 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance and the need for potential changes to the allowance  a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk with in the loan portfolio 
this assessment includes analyses of historical performance  past due trends  the level of nonperforning loans  reviews of certain impaired loans  loan activity since the last quarter  consideration of current economic conditions  and other pertinent information 
loans are assigned ratings  either individually for larger credits or in homogeneous pools  based on an internally developed grading system 
the resulting conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management 
the allocation of the allowance to the respective loan classifications is not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of the company 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance totaled million and million  or 
of loans held for investment  at september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  first financial reduced the allowance by  as a consequence of reductions in classified assets  changes in the composition of loans  higher balances of loans held for sale or sold during the year and the level of charge offs 
the allowance to nonperforming loans ratio was times and times at september  and september   respectively 
nonperforming loans increased to million as of september  from million at september  see asset quality above 
our analysis of allowance adequacy includes an impairment analysis for each nonperforming commercial loan 
based on the current economic environment and other factors  management believes that the allowance at september  was maintained at a level adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the following two tables set forth the changes in the allowance and an allocation of the allowance by loan category at the dates indicated 
total net loan charge offs increased to million in from million in net real estate loan charge offs totaled million in compared with net charge offs of  in consumer loan net charge offs were million in compared with million in consumer loan charge offs increased due to growth in consumer loans and a continuation of higher net charge off rates on auto loans and mobile homes 
underwriting standards were tightened in late fiscal on certain auto lending programs 
the company expects the charge off rate to be lower in the future on this sector of its portfolio 
commercial business loan net charge offs were  in compared with  in net charge offs in charge off levels are expected to remain above historical levels 
management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category

business deposits have in the past been a lesser source of funding 
the company has set strategic targets for net growth in retail and business transaction accounts annually and in numbers of households served 
the company believes that its future focus must be on increasing the number of available opportunities to provide a broad array of products and services to retail consumers and to commercial customers 
new commercial business products have been developed and the company proactively seeks development of business relationships 
during fiscal  the company emphasized a focus on growing core deposits  particularly money market  checking and other such products with the goal of reducing its cost of funds 
the company s total deposits increased million during the year ended september  first financial s deposit composition at september  and is as follows at september  balance percent of total balance percent of total dollar amounts in thousands checking accounts   statement and other accounts   money market accounts   certificate accounts   total deposits   long term national and local market trends over the past several years suggest that consumers have moved an increasing percentage of discretionary savings funds into investments such as annuities and stock and fixed income mutual funds 
while deposits remain a primary  highly stable source of funds for the company  deposits had started to decline in prior fiscal years as a percentage of liabilities 
management believes that conditions in fiscal and fiscal were more favorable for deposit growth 
factors such as the low returns on investments and mutual funds may have increased traditional deposit inflows recently 
core deposits grew by million in fiscal  or  while higher costing consumer certificate of deposit balances declined by million  or 
as of september   deposits as a percentage of liabilities were compared with at september  the company expects to maintain a significant portion of its deposits in core account relationships  however  future growth in deposit balances may be achieved primarily through specifically targeted programs offering higher yielding investment alternatives to consumers 
such targeted programs may increase the company s overall cost of funds and thus affect the company s future net margins 
the company s average cost of deposits at september  was compared with at september  borrowings borrowings declined million during the current year to million as of september  borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities were approximately at the end of compared with at the end of fiscal borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta declined million  reverse repurchase agreements declined million and other short term borrowings increased million 
the company s average cost of fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings increased from at september  to at september  during the year the company also extended the average maturity of fhlb advances to reduce interest rate risk 
approximately million in fhlb advances mature within one year 
other advances are subject to call during the next months but  based on the current market interest rates  such calls will likely not be exercised by the fhlb 
capital resources average shareholders equity was million during fiscal  or of average assets  increasing from during the consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income contained in item herein details the changes in stockholders equity during the year 
the principal reason for the increase in average equity to average assets during the current period is due to the retention of net income 
total equity capital increased from million at september  to million at september  the company s capital ratio of total capital to total assets  was at september  compared to at september  the company s tangible capital ratio at september  was compared with at september  recent stock repurchases included the purchase of  shares of common stock in fiscal  approximately  shares of common stock in fiscal and  shares of common stock in fiscal the dollar amount of such purchases totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company s cash dividend payout was of per share earnings compared with a payout ratio of in the company recently increased its cash dividend by to 
per share on an annual basis  effective with the payment during november to shareholders 
the association is required to meet the regulatory capital requirements of the ots  which currently include several measures of capital 
under current regulations  first federal meets all requirements including those to be categorized as well capitalized under risk based capital guidelines 
current capital distribution regulations of the ots allow the greatest flexibility to well capitalized institutions 
asset and liability management asset liability management is the process by which the company constantly changes the mix  maturity and pricing of assets and liabilities in an attempt to reduce a materially adverse impact on earnings resulting from the direction  frequency and magnitude of change in market interest rates 
although the net interest income of any financial institution is perceived as being vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates  the company s management has attempted to minimize that vulnerability 
the future regulatory capital requirements of all financial institutions will become subject to the inclusion of additional components measured by exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
the company  working principally through the asset and liability committee of the association  has established policies and monitors results to control interest rate risk 
the company utilizes measures such as static gap  which is the measurement of the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities repricing for a particular time period 
more important may be the process of evaluating how particular assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates or selected indices as they reprice 
asset liability modeling is performed by the company to assess varying interest rate and balance sheet mix assumptions 
management may adjust the company s interest rate sensitivity position primarily through decisions on the pricing  maturity and marketing of particular deposit and loan products and by decisions regarding the maturities of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the company has continued to emphasize adjustable rate mortgage real estate lending and short term consumer and commercial business lending to accomplish its objectives 
the following table sets forth in summary form the repricing attributes of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the time periods in the table represent the time period before an asset or liability matures or can be repriced 
interest rate sensitivity analysis at september  interest rate sensitivity period months months months months years over years cost interest earning assets dollar amounts in thousands loans      mortgage backed securities       interest earning deposits  investments and fhlb stock  total interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities deposits checking accounts       savings accounts       money market accounts   certificate accounts     total deposits       borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities    current period gap      cumulative gap      percent of total assets assumptions fixed rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to contractual principal amortization schedules 
adjustable rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to the next contractual interest rate adjustment date 
decay rates for savings accounts approximate in the first year and in the second year 
decay rates for checking accounts approximate in the first year and in the second year 
borrowings include fixed rate fhlb advances at the earlier of maturity date or potential call dates 
if fhlb advances are not called  maturities may extend 
based on the company s september  static gap position  in a one year time period million in interest sensitive assets will reprice and approximately million in interest sensitive liabilities will reprice or are subject to call 
this current static gap position results in a negative mismatch of million  or of assets 
the company s static gap position one year ago was a negative of assets 
the respective ratios and dollars repricing as shown in the above table do not take into effect prepayments to mortgage  consumer and other loans and mortgage backed securities  which are expected to be significant in the upcoming fiscal year  based on the current level and direction of market interest rates 
the above table also does not consider the repricing considerations inherent in adjustable rate loans  such as minimum and maximum annual and lifetime interest rate adjustments and also the index utilized 
after applying the company s estimates of prepayments of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities in a one year period and the company s expectations at call dates of certain fhlb advances  the company estimates it has a positive one year gap position of of assets at september  during the past five years the company extended maturities of interest sensitive assets through retention of certain types of loans  particularly those originated under newer hybrid lending programs with both fixed rate and variable rate features 
these loans have become very popular with consumers and carry a fixed rate of interest for three  five  or seven years and then adjust annually to an established index 
under current lower levels of market interest rates  the pace of prepayments has increased on these types of loans as consumers lock into longer term fixed rate loans 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company purchased million of hybrid loans originated in the northeast to allow for additional portfolio growth as expectations of prepayments increased 
under normal economic conditions  a negative gap would normally suggest that net interest income would increase if market rates declined 
a rise in market rates would normally have a detrimental effect on net interest income based on a negative gap 
the opposite would normally occur when an institution is positively gapped 
as market interest rates declined during fiscal the company s negative gap position was a factor in increasing the net interest margin 
it may be difficult to quantify expectations when interest rates are at very low levels  as we are currently experiencing 
with market interest rates at the lowest levels in many years  further declines may not result in the magnitude of change in asset and liability pricing experienced under more historical market conditions and would actually be expected to adversely affect the company s net interest margin because core deposit accounts may have already priced to potential floor levels 
it is unlikely that the company will have the ability to adjust core deposit rates to the extent suggested by the most recent basis point decline in market interest rates  although loans may gradually decline in reaction to certain market indices 
during fiscal as compared with fiscal  lower interest rates and a steeper yield curve resulted in expansion in the company s net interest margin and improvement in interest sensitivity 
derivatives and hedging activities derivative transactions may be used by the company to better manage its interest rate sensitivity to reduce risks associated with its lending  deposit taking  and borrowing activities 
effective october   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company began recognizing all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and reporting these instruments at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is used and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that the counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us 
when the fair value of the derivative contract is negative  no credit risk exists since the company would owe the counterparty 
the company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into our market risk sensitivity analysis 
at september   the fair value of derivative assets totaled million and was related to commitments to originate fixed rate loans held for sale and forward sales commitments 
the company s derivative and hedging activities are discussed in further detail in item  note of the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements  which principally include lending commitments and derivatives  are described blow 
at september  and  the company had no interests in non consolidated special purpose entities 
lending commitments lending commitments include loan commitments  standby letters of credit and unused business credit card lines 
these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitments 
the company provides these lending commitments to customers in the normal course of business 
for commercial customers  loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements to finance customers working capital requirements 
for retail customers  loan commitments are generally lines of credit secured by residential property 
at september   commercial and retail loan commitments totaled million 
standby letters of credit totaled million 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee performance  typically contract or financial integrity  of a customer to a third party 
unused business  personal and credit card lines  which totaled million at september   are generally for short term borrowings 
first financial applies essentially the same credit policies and standards as it does in the lending process when making these commitments
