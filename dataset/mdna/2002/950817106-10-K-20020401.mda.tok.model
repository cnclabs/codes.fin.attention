item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  below  for additional information 
participation in four risk pools covering hull  liability  workers compensation and satellite exposures relating to the aviation industry each to the extent of for and  for  of the hull and liability pools  of the workers compensation pool  and likely of the satellite pool all managed by a berkshire insurance group member 
another berkshire insurance group member provides a portion of the reinsurance protection to these aviation risk pools  and therefore to wes fic 
since september   insurance industry and governmental leaders have been working to identify alternatives to mitigate the insurance industry s concerns regarding the ability of the insurance 
table of contents industry to cover losses from terrorism catastrophes 
beyond limited assumptions of certain aviation exposures  the us government has not yet assumed any of this risk 
because of the magnitude and uncertainty of the catastrophic terrorism exposure  many insurers and reinsurers are responding primarily by restricting coverages where allowed and secondarily by raising premium rates 
various proposals are presently under consideration under which the federal government would assume significant losses arising from future terrorist attacks  thereby limiting this exposure to insurers and reinsurers 
it is currently unknown if or when any such proposals will be enacted 
although wes fic has no active super catastrophe reinsurance contracts in force  its management has indicated that wes fic will likely have opportunities to participate in such business from time to time in the future 
management believes that an insurer in the reinsurance business must maintain large net worth in relation to annual premiums in order to remain solvent when called upon to pay claims when a loss occurs 
in this regard  wes fic is believed to operate differently from many other reinsurers in that risks it writes are entirely retained  while other reinsurers may retrocede portions of the risks to other reinsurers  thereby assuming contingent risks that such reinsurers will not be able to respond if called upon to pay off on risks reinsured 
in this respect wes fic and kbs are competitively well positioned  inasmuch as their net premiums written for calendar amounted to only of their combined statutory surplus  compared to an industry average of about based on figures reported for wes fic is also licensed to write direct insurance business as distinguished from reinsurance in nebraska  utah  and iowa  and may write direct insurance in the non admitted excess and surplus lines market in several other states  but the volume written to date has been minimal 
in july  wes fic purchased kbs for approximately million in cash 
kbs provides specialized insurance coverage to more than of the banks in the united states  mostly small and medium size banks in the midwest 
it is licensed to write business in states 
kbs is also subject to regulation by the department of the treasury 
its product line for financial institutions includes policies for crime insurance  check kiting fraud indemnification  internet banking catastrophe bonds  directors and officers liability  bank employment practices  and professional errors and omissions indemnity  as well as deposit guaranty bonds  which insure deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance limits 
kbs  which for many years had minimized its risks arising from large losses through cessions to third party reinsurers  restructured its reinsurance program effective january  in order to retain a much higher portion of its premiums and risks of loss 
wesco s management anticipates that kbs s reinsurance restructuring will improve operating results over the long term in return for greater short term volatility 
kbs markets its products in some states through exclusive  commissioned agents  and direct to insureds in other states 
inasmuch as the number of small midwestern banks is declining as the banking industry consolidates  kbs relies for growth on an extraordinary level of service provided by its dedicated employees and agents  and on new products such as deposit guaranty bonds  which were introduced in and currently account for approximately one third of premiums written 
standard poor s corporation  in recognition of wes fic s strong competitive position as a member of berkshire s family of wholly and substantially owned insurance subsidiaries and its unusual capital strength  has assigned its highest rating  aaa  to wes fic s claims paying ability 
this rating recognizes the commitment of wes fic s management to a disciplined approach to underwriting and reserving  as well as wes fic s extremely strong capital base 
wesco s and wes fic s boards are hopeful  but have no assurance  that the businesses of wes fic and kbs will grow 
they welcome the opportunity to participate in additional reinsurance retrocessions and other insurance arrangements  as well as acquisitions of other insurance companies 
insurance companies are subject to regulation by the departments of insurance of the various states in which they write policies as well as the states in which they are domiciled and  if applicable  as is the case with kbs  by the department of the treasury 
regulations relate to  among other things  
table of contents capital requirements  shareholder and policyholder dividend restrictions  reporting requirements  annual audits by independent accountants  periodic regulatory examinations  and limitations on the size and types of investments that can be made 
wes fic  which is operated by nico  has no employees of its own 
kbs has employees 
furniture rental segment cort  acquired in february by a subsidiary of wesco  is the largest  and only national  provider of rental furniture  accessories and related services in the rent to rent as opposed to rent to own segment of the furniture industry 
it rents high quality furniture to corporate and individual customers who desire flexibility in meeting their temporary office  residential or tradeshow furnishing needs and who typically do not seek to own such furniture 
in addition  cort sells previously rented furniture through company owned clearance centers  thereby enabling it to regularly renew its inventory and update styles 
cort s national network includes showrooms  clearance centers and warehouses in states and the district of columbia as well as three web sites cortcom  relocationcentral 
com and corttradeshow 
com 
the rent to rent business is differentiated from the rent to own business primarily by the terms of the rental arrangements and the type of customer served 
rent to rent customers generally desire high quality furniture to meet temporary needs  have established credit  and pay on a monthly basis 
typically  these customers do not seek to acquire the property rented 
in the typical rent to rent transaction  the customer agrees to rent furniture for three to six months  subject to extension by the customer on a month to month basis 
by contrast  rent to own arrangements are generally made by customers without established credit whose objective is to acquire ownership of the property  these arrangements are typically entered into on a month to month basis and require weekly rental payments 
cort s customer base includes fortune companies  small businesses and professionals  and owners and operators of apartment communities 
cort s management believes that its size  national presence  consistently high level of customer service  product quality and breadth of selection  depth of management and efficient clearance centers have been key contributors to the company s success 
cort offers a full range of office  conference room and reception area furniture  panel systems and accessories 
cort emphasizes its ability to outfit an entire suite of offices with high quality furniture in two business days 
cort s objective is to build on these fundamentals and to further increase revenues by continuing to pursue its growth strategy 
the key components of this strategy are expanding its corporate customer base  making selective acquisitions  capturing an increasing number of internet customers through enhancements to its on line catalog and websites  and continuing to invest in the development of various products and services 
cort believes that  as a result  over the long term  margins will expand and operating earnings will increase 
in order to capitalize on the significant profit potential available from longer average rental periods and the higher average monthly rent for office products  cort s strategy is to place greater emphasis on rentals of office furniture than residential furniture 
in order to promote longer office lease terms  cort offers lower rates on leases where lease terms exceed six months 
a significant portion of cort s residential furniture rentals are derived from corporate relocations and temporary assignments  as new and transferred employees of cort s corporate customers enter into leases for residential furniture 
sales personnel maintain contact with corporate relocation departments and present the possibility of obtaining fully furnished rental apartments as a lower cost alternative to hotel accommodations 
thus  cort offers its corporate rental customers a way to reduce the costs of corporate relocation while developing residential business with new and transferred employees 
cort s relocation central corporation subsidiary relocation central  formed in january  is a web enabled customer management center which obtains relocation leads and distributes them to a company operated national network of locator agents 
relocation central operates 
table of contents apartment locator businesses in six metropolitan areas 
it intends to open apartment locator businesses in additional markets  either within cort s existing showrooms or in acquired premises 
the customer management center manages apartment and business furniture leads through its web site  relocationcentral 
com 
the website serves as an access site to users considering moving to major cities 
it provides useful data  such as information about vacant apartments  school systems  movers  local recreation and weather  as well as tips on relocating  at no charge 
relocation central s personnel also market cort s furniture rental business to real estate investment trusts and other owners of housing communities and apartment houses 
cort s management hopes that  through relocation central  cort will become the principal source of furniture rentals for large  multi unit owners whose tenants require rental furniture 
to date  more than apartment communities refer their tenants to cort 
cort also provides short term rentals for trade shows and conventions 
its corttradeshow 
com website assists in providing information to and gathering leads from prospects 
until the economy weakened beginning late in  cort benefited from increasing demand for furniture rental services 
cort s management believed that this favorable trend had been caused by continued growth in management and professional employment  the increasing importance to american business of flexibility and outsourcing  and the impact of a more mobile and transitory population 
cort s management attributes the decline in business experienced throughout its industry in to continued weakness of the economy  notably in the high technology sector  exacerbated by the terrorist activity on september the rent to rent segment of the furniture rental industry is highly competitive 
there are several large regional as well as a number of smaller regional and local rent to rent furniture companies 
in addition  numerous retailers offer residential and office furniture under rent to own arrangements 
management believes that the principal competitive factors in the furniture rental industry are product value  furniture condition  extent of furniture selection  terms of rental agreement  speed of delivery  exchange privilege  option to purchase  deposit requirements and customer service 
the majority of cort s furniture sales revenue is from clearance center sales 
the remaining furniture sales revenue is derived primarily from lease conversions and sales of new furniture 
sales of rental furniture allow cort to control inventory levels and maintain showroom quality of rental inventory 
on average  furniture is typically sold through the clearance centers three years after its initial purchase by the company 
with respect to sales of furniture through its clearance centers  cort competes with numerous used and new furniture retailers  some of which are larger than cort 
management believes that price and value are its principal competitive advantages in this activity 
cort and relocation central have approximately  employees  including union members 
management considers labor relations to be good 
industrial segment precision steel  acquired in  and one of its subsidiaries operate steel service centers in the chicago and charlotte metropolitan areas 
the service centers buy stainless steel  low carbon sheet and strip steel  coated metals  spring steel  brass  phosphor bronze  aluminum and other metals  cut these metals to order  and sell them to a wide variety of customers 
the service center business is highly competitive 
precision steel s annual sales volume of approximately thousand tons compares with the steel service industry s annual volume of approximately million tons 
precision steel competes not only with other service centers but also with mills which supply metal to the service centers 
competition exists in the areas of price  quality  availability of products and speed of delivery 
because it is willing to sell in relatively small quantities  precision steel has been able to compete in geographic areas distant from its service center facilities 

table of contents competitive pressure is intensified by imports and by a tendency of domestic manufacturers to use less costly materials in making parts 
precision brand products  inc precision brand  a wholly owned subsidiary of precision steel that is also located in the chicago area  manufactures shim stock and other toolroom specialty items  and distributes a line of hose and muffler clamps 
these products are sold under the precision brand and dupage names nationwide  generally through industrial distributors 
this business is highly competitive 
precision brand s share of the toolroom specialty products market is believed to approximate  statistics are not available with respect to its share of the market for hose and muffler clamps 
steel service raw materials are obtained principally from major domestic steel mills  and their availability is considered good 
precision steel s service centers maintain extensive inventories in order to meet customer demand for prompt deliveries  typically  processed metals are delivered to the customer within one week 
precision brand normally maintains inventories adequate to allow for off the shelf service to customers within hours 
the industrial segment businesses are subject to economic cycles 
these businesses are not dependent on a few large customers 
the backlog of steel service orders decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  there are full time employees engaged in the industrial segment businesses  about of whom are members of unions 
management considers labor relations to be good

financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  down from billion per share at december  the decrease was due to a decline in appreciation in market value of investments  which under accounting convention  is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded based upon current market quotations  gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation 
net unrealized appreciation constituted of shareholders equity at december   compared to at december  see the section on market risk analysis appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on investments 
at december   wesco s consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled million  down from million at december  the million decrease resulted from a number of factors as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows in wesco s accompanying consolidated financial statements 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  most of the borrowings related to a million revolving line of credit used by cort in its furniture rental business  the balance outstanding decreased during the year due to repayments by cort  using internally generated cash

of the premiums written by wes fic for and  million and million were attributable to its participation in a three year arrangement for the reinsurance of of certain 
table of contents property and casualty risk exposure ceded by a large  unaffiliated insurance group 
wes fic s written premiums for related mainly to its participation in super catastrophe reinsurance arrangements  notably a three year florida hurricane risk policy that ended  without loss  at yearend 
the increases in premiums written by kbs for each of the past two years were principally due to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds 
this product  which to date has not resulted in a loss  currently accounts for approximately of premiums written by kbs

million and million attributed to wes fic 
wes fic s underwriting loss in resulted mainly from a loss provision of million before income taxes million after taxes recorded as a result of the terrorist activity of september  the amount is an estimate and is subject to considerable estimation error 
in addition  management believes that it will take years to resolve complicated coverage issues related to the aforementioned terrorism activity  which could have a material effect on the ultimate loss incurred 
aggregate underwriting results benefited by million  million and million in  and from downward revisions of estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for those periods 
wes fic has participated in super catastrophe reinsurance from time to time  and  although no such business was entered into in or  participations may again become available in the future 
although no super catastrophe reinsurance losses have been incurred to date  wesco s management believes that catastrophe losses will inevitably occur from time to time during periods when wes fic participates actively in such business 
while such large losses are not expected to be significant in relation to wes fic s capital base  management accepts the prospect of increased volatility in wes fic s short term underwriting results in order to obtain what is believed will be better long term results 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
wesco s management believes such exposure to be minimal 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on earnings retained and reinvested by wes fic  on capital contributed by wesco  and on float funds invested pending payment of claims 
dividend and interest income  before income taxes  amounted to million  million and million for  and the increases in the two most recent years were due principally to the sale of wes fic s investment in freddie mac common stock in various transactions throughout the proceeds of billion were reinvested mainly in fixed income securities 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
a significant marketing strategy followed by berkshire s insurance subsidiaries  including wesco s insurance segment  is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength 
the combined statutory surplus of wesco s insurance businesses totaled approximately billion at december  this capital strength creates opportunities for the wesco subsidiaries to participate in reinsurance and insurance contracts not necessarily available to many of their competitors 
although wesco would 
table of contents welcome other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  or acquisitions of insurance businesses  the timing and extent of any increase in its insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted

the number of leases outstanding and the average revenue per lease at the end of were continuing on a downward trend begun in s fourth quarter 
the decline is attributed mainly to continued weakness of the economy  notably in the high technology sector  exacerbated by the terrorist activity of september  furniture sales revenues increased in and in principally as a result of cort s ongoing efforts to maintain the quality of its rental furniture 
cort established new retail pricing procedures in the second quarter of that have improved sales but reduced the margin slightly 
cost of furniture rentals and sales amounted to of related revenues for the year  versus for and for the increasing cost percentages reflected an increase in the proportion of distribution costs relating to the handling of rental furniture to revenues  and a reduction in the gross margin on furniture sales as cort reduced prices in its efforts to dispose of excess idle inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in of that amount  million was incurred by relocation central in the startup of its apartment locator operation 
excluding those expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for to of rental and sales revenues  versus for the year and for the year the increases were due principally to increases in employee compensation and benefits expenses 
although cort reduced the number of its full time employees by approximately 
table of contents during  escalating health care costs more than offset the reduction in wages 
occupancy costs also increased 
cort has undertaken strict cost cutting measures  including a further reduction in the number of full time employees as well as the elimination of redundant or marginal facilities 
cort has noted a trend of diminishing showroom sales volume combined with increased volume via the internet and fax  which may lead to improvements in productivity and profitability in the future 
cort s income before income taxes decreased to of total revenues for the year from for the year and for these decreases were due not only to unfavorable operating expense comparisons  summarized above  but  for  to the decline in revenues

revenues for increased 
despite a decrease in pounds of steel products sold 
revenues for decreased despite a increase in pounds of steel products sold 
in  there was a significant reduction in demand due both to continued weakness in the economy and increased competitive pressures  already extreme  and a change in mix of products sold toward lower priced products 
in  increases in selling prices in response to increases in costs of its raw materials were almost completely offset by the effects of a softening demand for precision steel s products caused by increasing concerns over general economic conditions within the manufacturing segment of the economy 
income before income taxes and net income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold

table of contents unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments

year ended december  goodwill amortization  before income tax effect income tax benefit goodwill amortization realized net securities gains  before income tax effect income tax provision realized net securities gains other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate dividend and interest income net gains on sales of foreclosed real estate reduction in allowance for losses on foreclosed real estate real estate and general and administrative expenses interest expense other items  net income loss before income tax benefit income tax provision net income from other nonsegment activities goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of identified net assets of acquired businesses 
in the case of the wesco group  it relates to the acquisitions of cort and kbs  as well as smaller entities acquired by cort following its purchase by wesco in february the increase in amortization of goodwill for was due principally to the inclusion of a full year s amortization of cort goodwill in  versus less than eleven months in goodwill has been amortized mainly on a straight line basis over years 
however  as explained in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  goodwill accounting will change significantly in realized gains and losses on the wesco group s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly  as in however  the amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains or losses are reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering event  they are credited or charged  net of tax effect  to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity merely a transfer from unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings for contained net realized securities gains  after income taxes  of million  compared to million of after tax gains for no gains or losses were realized in other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate  dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  and gains on sales of foreclosed real estate previously owned by a former savings and loan subsidiary together with reductions of reserves for possible losses on such sales  
table of contents reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses and interest and other corporate expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
net income or loss from other nonsegment activities typically fluctuates from period to period but is not significant in amount 
the and figures benefited to the extent of 
million and 
million  after tax effect  from reductions in reserves for possible losses on disposition of foreclosed real estate  there were no adjustments of these reserves in ms property has completed selling its foreclosed properties 
nonsegment dividend and interest income has declined sharply in recent years mainly due to conversions of preferred stocks into lower yielding common stocks in and and to the contributions of certain of those investments to the insurance segment 
the net tax provision or benefit from other nonsegment activities each year appears at first glance to be anomalous compared to pre tax income or loss 
this is caused generally by the inclusion in pre tax income or loss of declining amounts of dividend income  which is taxed at lower rates than other revenue and expense items 
wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates from period to period for various reasons  such as the inclusion in consolidated revenues of significant  varying amounts of dividend income  which is substantially exempt from income taxes 
the respective income tax provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as the acquisition of cort 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as changes in the economy  which have adversely affected cort and precision steel  and unforeseen events such as the september  terrorist activity which adversely affected wes fic 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive  operate on tight gross profit margins  and carry inventories on a lifo basis  thus their earnings are susceptible to inflationary cost increases 
market risk analysis wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
otherwise  the consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  down from million one year earlier 
the decline was due to a decline in market values  no marketable equity securities were purchased or sold during the carrying values of wesco s securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in their filings with the securities and exchange commission  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amounts realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 

table of contents interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  up from million one year earlier 
an increase in mortgage backed securities million at december  versus million one year earlier was substantially offset by reductions in other securities 
as noted in the preceding section on equity price risk  wesco prefers to acquire entire businesses or invest in equity securities 
when unable to do so  it may invest in mortgage backed securities  government bonds or other interest rate sensitive investments 
wesco s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risk 
wesco recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
additionally  fair values of these investments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table shows the estimated effects as of december  and of hypothetical overall increases and decreases in interest rates on the fair value of wesco s fixed maturity investments and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
december  december  fair value of shareholders fair value of shareholders investments equity investments equity as recorded hypothetical change in interest rate percentage point decrease percentage point increase percentage point increase percentage point increase the hypothetical changes in market interest rates assumed in preparing the table do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
for example  variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments of mortgage backed securities due to prepayment options available to borrowers under the mortgages 
for this and other reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
