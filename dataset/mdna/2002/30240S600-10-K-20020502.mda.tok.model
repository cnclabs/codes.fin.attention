critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported results 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of inventories  long lived assets  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
the company believes that the following represents the areas where more critical estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories consist of finished goods purchased for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined on a weighted average basis 
the company monitors inventory levels and inventory turns to mitigate excess inventory amounts 
long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the asset s undiscounted net cash flows over its remaining life in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach under which deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of such deferred tax assets may not be realized

prior to september   athanor holdings  llc has the right to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of the junior convertible notes  including any accrued but unpaid interest  into common stock 
prior to and on september   we may redeem the aggregate outstanding balance of the junior convertible notes  including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon  in whole but not in part  at a price equal to of such aggregate outstanding balance  provided that junior convertible notes i may not be redeemed prior to september  and ii athanor holdings  llc has days from our notice of our intention to redeem the junior convertible note to determine if it would like to exercise its conversion privilege in lieu of any such redemption by us 
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties  if athanor has not exercised its conversion privilege prior to september   we must redeem the junior convertible note  including any accrued and unpaid interest  on september  in november  in connection with the consent to the fao acquisition  the junior convertible notes became convertible upon the closing of the fao acquisition

in connection with an interim operating agreement between fao schwarz  inc  us  kbb retail assets corp

sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
on an annual basis  and when there is reason to suspect that their values have been diminished or impaired  these assets must be tested for impairment  and write downs may be necessary

unaudited quarterly data quarter ended may  august  november  february  fiscal dollars in thousands net revenues      gross profit      pre tax income loss      earnings loss per share quarter ended april  july  october  february  fiscal dollars in thousands net revenues      gross profit      pre tax income loss     earnings loss per share risks you should consider carefully all the information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we confront 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to financial and economic matters 
our operating results are difficult to predict 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of zany brainy  inc and its affiliates collectively  zany brainy on september   including retail stores in states  through a sale of assets and assignment of liabilities pursuant to sections and of the us bankruptcy code the zany brainy acquisition 
the zany brainy business is significantly larger than our business was prior to the zany brainy acquisition 
operating results in these new zany brainy stores are expected to depend to a significant extent on our sales during the months of november and december 
we acquired assets of fao schwarz and quality fulfillment services  inc on january   including retail stores in states and the flagship store in new york city the fao acquisition 
the fao schwarz business is significantly larger than our business prior to the zany brainy acquisition and constitutes a significant portion of the combined business 
operating results in these new fao schwarz stores are also expected to depend to a significant extent on our sales during the months of november and december 
during an economic downturn we expect to see reduced sales at our existing stores with the primary impact being in our mall stores 
reductions in tourist traffic negatively impact sales at our fao schwarz flagship stores 
our operating results in our new retail stores depend in part on the speed with which such new stores reach sales maturity 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we have a history of operating losses 
we reported operating losses of million in fiscal  and operating losses related to the right start retail store operations for fiscal of million and for fiscal of million 
we cannot assure you that the assets we purchased in the zany brainy acquisition or the fao acquisition will not also produce operating losses in the future 
we may continue to experience losses or fluctuations in our operations 
specifically  our annual and quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the results of operations for the zany and fao brands  unforeseen integration costs  the timing and costs associated with placing right start boutiques in zany stores  the timing and costs of our store expansion strategy when it is reintroduced  the introduction of new products and changes in the mix of products sold  and the availability of and customer demand for particular products 
losses could negatively affect our working capital and the extension of credit by our suppliers  and our ability to implement our retail expansion strategy if and when we restart it 
failure to integrate successfully the businesses acquired in the zany brainy acquisition and the fao acquisition with our existing operations could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we need to integrate the businesses and operations acquired by our subsidiary  zb company  inc in the zany brainy acquisition and by our subsidiary fao schwarz  inc in the fao acquisition 
our failure to do so effectively could result in a loss of key personnel  employees and customers and could result in significant expense 
our integration efforts may distract our management from operations 
either result could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we have begun to introduce right start boutiques into our existing zany brainy stores  combine certain accounting and operational functions and sell certain assets acquired in the zany brainy acquisition and the fao acquisition 
if we fail to do so efficiently we may not recognize cost savings from our integration and may have less capital than we need to operate effectively 
we are adjusting our cost structure at zany brainy and fao schwarz 
these adjustments include reducing marketing expenses and reducing dependence of the zany brainy brand on price promotions 
we may reduce costs too dramatically  negatively impacting our ability to operate effectively  or we may lose sales as a result of changing our marketing budget and strategy 
we expect benefits from cross merchandising our products among brands and from cross promotion among brands and channels but we cannot assure you that these benefits will materialize 
we also expect benefits from rationalizing our distribution operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to rationalize our distribution operations as planned or that we will recognize the cost savings we expect 
restrictive loan covenants and significant lender discretion under our credit facility may directly or indirectly limit our ability to take desired corporate actions and restrict our cash flow  limiting our ability to operate our business 
we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with the bank as of april   which combined the credit facilities we previously maintained separately for zb company  inc  and for ourselves and fao schwarz  inc the consolidated credit facility 
our operating subsidiaries  fao schwarz  inc and zb company  inc  are also borrowers under the consolidated credit facility  which consists of a standard revolving line of up to million and an additional special term subline of up to million 
the borrowers obligations are secured by liens on substantially all of their assets with certain exceptions for liens granted to other parties 
a portion of the proceeds from the consolidated credit facility was used to retire amounts due under our former credit facility and the credit facility maintained by zb company  inc  and the remaining portion is available for general corporate purposes in accordance with our operating budget that has been approved by the bank the budget 
as of may   we had approximately outstanding under the consolidated credit facility and aggregate availability of approximately million 
the consolidated credit facility limits capital expenditures to amounts approved by the bank 
we are required to have net earnings excluding extraordinary non cash gain or loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization at least equal to of amounts projected in our budget on a rolling twelve month basis tested monthly beginning december with december and january measured on a year to date basis 
we must maintain a minimum availability under the standard revolving line of not less than million through november  and during the calendar months of july through november thereafter and million during the calendar months of january through june and december 
we also must maintain a cost value of inventory that is within our budget all times 
after december   if the special term subline remains outstanding  we must maintain a ratio of inventory receipts to costs of goods sold of not less than from january through may  in june  in august and september  in october  in november and in december 
in addition  after december   if the special term line remains outstanding our maximum effective advance rate tested at the end of each calendar month or  in the case of december  on december is limited to of the value of eligible inventory from january through march  from april through july  from august through november and for december 
as of may   our effective advance rate was 
finally  for so long at the special term subline remains outstanding  the aggregate of all advances under the consolidated credit facility  the special term subline amount and certain letters of credit may not exceed of the nrlv of our eligible inventory through october   from november through december and thereafter 
as of may  the aggregate of such amounts was equal to of the nrlv of our eligible inventory 
the special term subline may be terminated and replaced without costs other than payment of fees that have been earned in advance thereunder 
we intend to replace the special term subline on or before december  through the proceeds of a debt or equity offering  though we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under the consolidated credit facility 
in the past we have occasionally failed to comply with certain covenants in our credit facilities with the bank 
while the bank has always granted waivers or amended the relevant facility in connection with our noncompliance  we cannot assure you that it would do so in the future 
because our fao schwarz and zany brainy businesses are highly seasonal we depend to a significant extent on the consolidated credit facility to fund our cash flow needs for most of the year 
the consolidated credit facility limits our ability to borrow additional money  pay dividends  dispose of assets  make additional corporate investments  increase director and officer compensation and experience a change of control 
our ability to take desired corporate actions and to fund our operations is dependent on our compliance with these restrictions or our ability to obtain bank waivers of them 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these restrictions or that the bank would waive them 
competition from mass market retailers and discounters  which have strong brand recognition and financial and other resources  may have a negative impact on our sales 
many mass market retailers and discounters  such as toys r us  wal mart and target  have strong brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we could be at a disadvantage in responding to these competitors merchandising and pricing strategies  advertising campaigns and other initiatives 
several of these competitors  including toys r us  have launched successful internet shopping sites which compete with our stores and internet marketing channels 
in addition  an increase in focus on the specialty retail market or the sale by these competitors of more products similar to ours could cause us to lose market share 
any significant reduction in or restriction on the availability of our trade credit could result in materially reduced sales 
as do many retailers  we depend on the availability of credit from the suppliers of our inventory 
our trade creditors permit us a period of time after shipment to pay for the goods they ship to us 
if our trade creditors significantly restrict the terms on which we may pay  we may be unable to replace that credit from other sources 
several of our trade creditors provide a significant amount of the inventory we sell 
if they were to restrict the terms on which we may pay or otherwise refuse to do business with us  we may have to replace them and we cannot assure you that we would find acceptable replacements or that we would not suffer reduced sales while in the process of replacing them 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available to us  and which may  if raised  dilute our existing shareholders ownership interest in us 
we expect that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the near term and we are in the process of raising additional capital to cover such needs for the remainder of the next months 
we cannot assure you that we will find such additional capital on acceptable terms 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to purchase needed inventory  open right start boutiques within zany brainy stores or open new stores  enhance our infrastructure  hire  train and retain employees  keep up with technological advances  respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  or pursue acquisition opportunities 
we raised additional capital in order to accomplish the zany brainy acquisition 
the capital raised  together with the equity issued to accomplish the fao acquisition  diluted our existing shareholders ownership position in the company 
we issued securities that converted or are convertible into a total of approximately million shares of our common stock  or approximately of the total number of our outstanding shares assuming conversion of those convertible securities 
if we raise additional capital in the future our existing shareholder s ownership interest may again be diluted 
we cannot assure you that the use to which we put any additional capital raised will increase the value of the company proportionately to the amount of dilution a shareholder experiences in such a transaction 
if such an increase does not occur  the value of such shareholder s ownership position may decrease 
potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  adversely affect our operating results and dilute shareholder value 
we may acquire other businesses in the future  which may complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to do so could result in our inability to retain the management  key personnel  employees and customers of the acquired business 
such integration efforts also may distract our management from our existing operations 
our failure to manage future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our shareholders could be diluted if we finance the acquisitions by incurring debt or issuing equity securities 
we are susceptible to changing economic conditions and localized events  which may affect our results of operations 
our business depends heavily on middle to upper income individuals whose income may be adversely affected by changes in the national economy 
a prolonged economic downturn throughout the united states may decrease sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we would expect such a decrease to be felt first and most strongly in our mall stores and  in the case of reduced tourism  in our fao schwarz flagship stores 
in addition  our stores typically face short term or limited effects from localized events such as weather and local economic events 
we may incur significant expense if we decide to change our auditors 
arthur andersen llp  our independent auditor  was recently charged by the us department of justice for felony obstruction of justice in connection with their role as auditors for enron corporation 
we do not know the impact of the indictment  or whether additional indictments may be made by the department of justice 
the result of the indictment or other lawsuits against arthur andersen may cause us to select another independent auditor 
in that case  we may incur significant expense in familiarizing the new auditors with our accounting 
risks related to our business and operations we are dependent on third party service providers and may suffer monetary losses if we must replace their services 
we have entered into a number of service agreements with third parties 
we have limited control over these other companies and have no long term relationships with any of them 
although we believe that our service providers are reputable and dependable  we cannot assure you that these parties will continue to perform such services or that they can be replaced on terms favorable to us 
our operations depend on third parties for the following services software services  transportation and delivery services  inventory and returns storage and handling  credit card processing  and telecom access 
our business relies on foreign product sources and our profits could be adversely affected by factors related to such dependence 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
instead  we buy all of our products from manufacturers and distributors 
right start products are purchased from over different vendors worldwide 
zb company  inc and fao schwarz  inc 
each purchase from over different vendors  though many of these vendors supply across the brands 
in total  between and of right start product is purchased from foreign vendors 
zb company  inc imports between and of its purchases  including most of its private label products  directly from foreign manufacturers 
fao schwarz  inc imports over of its purchases 
in addition  a significant number of the products we purchase from domestic suppliers are manufactured abroad 
historically  imported items have had higher gross profit margins 
imports allow us to offer a large selection of unique goods 
we expect that we will become even more dependent on imported items in our operations 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with relying on foreign manufacturers  such as the inability to return products  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  economic and political instability  transportation or production delays  restrictive actions by foreign governments  the laws and policies of the united states affecting importation of goods  including duties  quotas and taxes  foreign trade and tax laws  adverse publicity due to foreign labor practices  trade infringement claims  and failure of our customs brokers to comply with import regulations 
our profitability is therefore dependent on our ability to manage such risks while still offering an appealing product mix at profitable prices 
interruptions or delays in our imports could cause shortages in our product inventory and a decline in our sales unless we secure alternative supply arrangements 
even if we could locate alternative sources  the products from such sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than those we currently purchase 
our sales could also suffer if our suppliers experience similar problems with foreign manufacturers 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain unique products produced domestically or internationally or higher gross margins on imported products 
nor can we assure you that we would be able to replace any particular vendor if our relationship with the vendor were to prove unsatisfactory with the result that we may not be able to offer the selection or quality that our consumers demand and the potential that we may lose sales 
our operations depend on independent manufacturers and loss of any of our key vendors could impact our profitability 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
instead we depend on manufacturers and distributors to supply us enough products at competitive prices 
one of our vendors provided approximately of the right start inc s overall purchases in fiscal two suppliers each supply approximately of zb company  inc s purchases 
one supplier supplies of fao schwarz  inc s purchases 
if a manufacturer cannot ship orders to us in a timely manner or meet our quality standards  we may run short of inventory in our retail stores 
our customers may subsequently look to find the products they desire elsewhere 
any of these circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our independent manufacturing sources 
as such  we compete with other companies for production facilities 
if we are unable to obtain products that meet the demands of our customers  our sales may fall 
we believe that we have close relationships with our manufacturing sources 
our future success  however  partly depends on our ability to maintain these types of relationships 
our operations could be disrupted if information systems fail which could negatively impact our sales 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications software and hardware systems 
we regularly make investments to upgrade  enhance and replace our systems 
as part of the investments we received at the time of the zany brainy acquisition we were required to acquire the online business conducted under the right start brand from its owners 
we use the assets of this entity for our internet marketing for the right start brand and also have relaunched internet marketing for the zany brainy brand using the same technology 
we have also integrated website development and marketing functions for the right start  zany brainy and fao brands 
our failure to successfully operate these internet channels could result in the loss of a marketing opportunity or materially adversely affect our operations generally 
we have no formal disaster recovery plan to prevent delays or other complications arising from information systems failure 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
competition from internet only retailers  which may have a cost advantage and reach a broader market  may have a negative impact on our business 
we face competition from internet only retailers  such as amazon 
com 
such retailers may have a cost advantage and reach a broader market  which may have a negative impact on our business or on our ability to expand our business 
competition from smaller format  specialty educational and creative toy retailers may impair our sales growth 
our direct competitors include smaller format  specialty educational and creative toy and game retailers who compete with us primarily on the basis of service 
these retailers could impede our ability to increase our sales 
competition from all of our competitors could cause our sales and profitability to suffer 
with respect to all of our competitors  our sales and profitability could suffer if new competitors enter markets in which we are currently operating  our competitors consolidate successfully with stronger entities and increase their competition with us  our competitors implement aggressive pricing strategies  our competitors expand their operations  our suppliers sell their products directly to  or enter into exclusive arrangements with  our competitors  or our competitors adopt innovative store formats  retail sales methods or merchandising strategies that are similar to ours or more appealing to our customers 
if we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand  we may lose customers and our sales may decline 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
if we misjudge the market for our merchandise  we may overstock such products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which may have a negative impact on our profitability  or return overstocked products to vendors  which may have a negative impact on our relationships with our vendors 
alternatively  we may understock our products and lose sales 
our retail expansion strategy  if we restart it  exposes us to risks of growth 
since fiscal  the right start retail store operating strategy has focused on opening and operating new retail stores at street locations  while closing less profitable retail stores at certain mall locations 
while we do not currently plan to open many new stores in fiscal  we expect to restart this strategy for fiscal for zany brainy right start combination stores 
we cannot assure you that our retail store strategy will be profitable 
if we restart our retail store expansion strategy  our ability to open and operate new stores profitably will be dependent on the identification and availability of suitable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms  our financial resources  the successful hiring and training of store managers and our ability to control the operational aspects of growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis or that same store sales will increase in the future 
we would expect to fund store openings from cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
we cannot assure you that cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our credit facility would be adequate for us to open new stores on any timeframe we may set for ourselves 
risks related to operations of the right start store chain we may incur costs in connection with the closing of mall stores 
over time  we expect to replace all or nearly all of our mall stores with street location stores as our mall store leases expire 
in addition  we may close additional stores if we deem such a decision to be warranted and we can do so on what we determine is a cost effective basis 
in each of the last two fiscal years store closings have resulted in store closing expense 
we may choose to close stores prior to lease expiration in which case we may be unable to assign such leases in a manner that allows us to avoid store closing costs 
in addition  upon natural expiration of our leases we may be unable to find suitable locations nearby that allow us to retain the customer base we have developed 
risks related to zb company  inc and fao schwarz  inc 
operations the business of each of zb company  inc and fao schwarz  inc 
is highly seasonal  and annual results are highly dependent on the success of the christmas selling season 
a significant portion of the sales of each of zb company  inc and fao schwarz  inc is expected to occur in our fourth quarter generally november through january coinciding with the christmas holiday shopping season 
therefore  the contributions by these brands to our results of operations for the entire year depend largely on fourth quarter results 
typically  these business have not been profitable in any quarter other than the fourth quarter of any fiscal year  and this trend may continue 
factors that could cause the sales and profitability of these businesses to suffer include the availability of and customer demand for particular products  adverse weather conditions  unfavorable economic conditions  inability to hire adequate personnel  and inability to maintain appropriate inventory levels 
if we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand for popular products  we may lose customers and zb company  inc and fao schwarz  inc sales may decline 
it is common in the toy industry for some popular products  such as pokemon and beanie babies  to achieve high sales  but for unpredictable periods of time 
consumer demand for popular products can and does decrease significantly without warning 
we intend to rely less on this type of product at zb company  inc as a result  we do not expect to enjoy such high sales drivers for zb company  inc fao schwarz  inc 
will depend for the success of the fao brand on continued identification of high quality  unique items that generate strong popular demand 
if we are unable to identify alternative products for zb company  inc more in keeping with its educational focus and popular products for fao schwarz  inc that enjoy strong consumer demand  we may lose customers and reduce customer traffic in their stores  which will result in a decline in sales 
the introduction of new products may also depress sales of existing products 
in addition  a decrease in the demand for popular products may negatively effect comparable store sales 
moreover  because at our zany brainy stores we sell only those products that conform to zb company  inc s product mission  we may choose not to sell some products that zany brainy s customers desire and thus lose potential sales 
risks related to zb company  inc operations competition from non toy specialty retailers  which compete with zb company  inc s children s book and software businesses  could negatively affect zb company  inc s business in these categories 
non toy specialty retailers  such as barnes noble and best buy  are competing with zb company  inc s children s book and software businesses 
such competition could significantly hinder zb company  inc sales in these categories 
risks related to fao schwarz  inc operations the failure of fao schwarz  inc to maintain product exclusivity could result in reduced sales and increased marketing expense 
a large percentage of fao brand sales are generated from products not generally available from mass toy merchants 
in addition  fao stores are routinely the launch sites for new product offerings

we were sued by oxygen media  llc to recover the alleged value of cable television and internet media time allegedly provided or to be provided to us and our affiliate rightstart 
com inc the basis for the claim is a term sheet that oxygen admits was non binding and the actual provision of services under written orders 
oxygen asserts that we and rightstart
