item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method  on either the percentage incentive program pip or on a fixed fee consignment basis 
using either consignment method  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under pip 
the increase in the percentage of vehicles sold under pip in fiscal is due principally to our marketing efforts 
we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip  which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under fixed fee agreements 
the decline in the percentage of vehicles under fixed contracts is the direct result of our marketing efforts to convert contracts from fixed fee to pip 
additionally  for the fiscal year ended july   approximately of the vehicles sold by us were processed pursuant to purchase contracts  under which we record the gross proceeds of the vehicle sale in purchased vehicle revenues and the cost of the vehicle in yard and fleet expenses 
due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of new acquisitions  market conditions  and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers  the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary 
our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing  special preparation  storage and auctioning 
salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own 
costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  fleet maintenance and repair  and acquisition costs of vehicles we sold under purchase programs 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  accounting and data processing  sales personnel  professional fees and marketing expenses 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such periods 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired seventeen vehicle auction facilities and established twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal  we have acquired new facilities in or near new castle  delaware  savannah  georgia  tifton  georgia  charleston  west virginia  haslet  texas and greencastle  pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near lyman  maine  tucson  arizona  somerville  new jersey and amarillo  texas 
in fiscal  we acquired facilities in or near chatham  virginia  shreveport  louisiana and mount morris  pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near harrisburg  pennsylvania  chicago heights  illinois  martinez  california  lawrenceburg  kentucky and new orleans  louisiana 
in fiscal  we acquired facilities in or near chesapeake  virginia  peoria  illinois  north boston  massachusetts  boise  idaho  pasco  washington  abilene  texas  san antonio  texas and albuquerque  new mexico and opened new facilities in graham  washington  denver  colorado and west palm beach  florida 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our national coverage 
we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers and iv developing and expanding public automobile auction facilities 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we defer  in vehicle pooling costs  certain yard and fleet expenses of vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and certain yard and fleet expenses of the period 
the primary expenses capitalized are labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our estimates are incorrect then yard and fleet expenses of the current period would be over or under stated and the opposite under or over statement would occur in the future 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we evaluate the impairment of goodwill annually at a facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
under this accounting policy we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a facility could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income 
based on our historical operating earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded and  accordingly  have not established a valuation allowance 
additional timing differences  future earnings trends and or tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for a valuation allowance 
we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset in the future

there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to financial market risk is interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest primarily in corporate securities  bank certificates  us treasury and agency obligations  asset backed securities  repurchase agreements  auction rate debt instruments and money market mutual funds and generally hold them to maturity 
consequently  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is days or less 
our guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue as well the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria in our guidelines  we do not expect that our exposure to market and credit risk will be material
