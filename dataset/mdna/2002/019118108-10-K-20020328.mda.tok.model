in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  increasing competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  and other future factors 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method is used by mecar for substantially all of its sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during  and  respectively 
the value of contracts in process at december  and were and and the profits recognized on these contracts through december  were approximately and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  based on the amount of actual cost incurred during the period compared to total estimated cost to be incurred for the total contract 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and the effect of any change in cost estimates are reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is identified 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances  material usage variances  delivery schedules and testing requirements 
additionally  as inventory items increase in age  obsolete and excess items are charged to cost of sales when such determination is made 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by mecar  coupled with the experience of its management team  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual result will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
trends in operations each of mecar and the vsk group contributed to a very successful we also took the first step in our plan to extend the reach of our strategic defense and security businesses by acquiring microwave 
mecar operated near capacity of its facilities throughout much of the vast majority of mecar s revenues resulted from orders from its traditional customer base 
mecar s revenues included contracts for the benefit of its traditional customers via the foreign military sales program fms as well as from direct and indirect contracts with and for the benefit of the end user customers 
mecar has supplied both mm ammunition and mm mortar ammunition for use in two new weapon systems acquired by one of mecar s traditional customers via fms contracts 
the customer has indicated a need and desire for additional rounds of each of the mm ammunition and mm mortar ammunition 
in early march   allied announced the award by such customer of a three year  fms contract for mm ammunition 
mecar s results were positively impacted by a supplemental contract awarded as part of an fms contract for a new series of ammunition developed by mecar 
the contract requires mecar to correct deficiencies in the ammunition detected by tests performed by the us government 
the revenue from the contract was recognized in the third and fourth quarters of since the most critical tests performed by the us government only identified minimal deficiencies 
a provision was established by mecar to cover corrections and other costs that might be incurred 
this contract provided approximately forty percent of allied s profits 
the final tests and mecar s corrections should be completed by mid the vsk group recorded another excellent year in it contributed approximately in revenues and in pre tax profits 
the reported earnings of each of mecar and the vsk group were adversely impacted by the fluctuations of the euro during allied commenced with a consolidated backlog of approximately compared with a consolidated backlog at the beginning of of mecar began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of vsk began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of approximately microwave commenced with a backlog of approximately in future periods  allied s operations will continue to be impacted by mecar s ability to obtain large orders on a periodic basis  allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of other business and allied s ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions  such as microwave 
trends in liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity did not materially improve in despite the excellent operating results and an increase in working capital 
mecar utilized a line of credit and other short term bank facilities of up to during to fund working capital requirements 
while the line of credit was repaid by december   mecar required temporary bank loans to cover overdrafts of approximately in addition  allied made advances of to mecar throughout to supplement mecar s working capital needs 
these advances were repaid prior to the end of in an effort to minimize the liquidity shortage at mecar  in early the bank syndicate provided a partial waiver of the requirement to pledge cash to collateralize performance bonds and advance payment guarantees 
the waiver expired in mid at which point mecar was required to provide the full amount of pledged cash  as collateral  as required by the bank syndicate agreement 
throughout  allied management engaged in a review and analysis of its company wide financing requirements 
as a result  mecar s bank syndicate agreement has been recently modified as described below under liquidity 
allied anticipates that the modification will increase mecar s credit facility  will provide a maximum amount of pledged cash required for contracts and will potentially provide allied increased access to cash generated by mecar 
no liquidity shortages have been forecasted for for the long term  the generation of positive cash flow from core operations will depend upon mecar s ability to continue to receive orders from its traditional customer base  the ability of mecar to broaden its revenue base and the ability of allied to successfully expand its group of strategic security businesses 
liquidity working capital  which includes restricted cash  was approximately at december   which is an increase of from the december  level 
allied s current working capital is required for operations and to support credit facility agreements 
cash and equivalents at december  increased over year end levels largely as a result of profitable operations 
accounts receivable at december  increased over december  levels by principally due to the acquisition of microwave 
costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by from year end levels as a result of decreased amounts of work in progress at the end of inventories at year end were higher than at the end of prepaid expenses were essentially unchanged from levels 
intangibles increased from levels due to the microwave acquisition 
deferred taxes increased in by as a result of the recognition of the tax benefit related to the net operating loss carryforward from us operations 
current liabilities decreased by from december  levels due to increased cash availability from operations which was used to reduce payables 
during  and  allied funded its operations principally with internally generated cash and back up credit facilities required for foreign government contracts 
in addition  mecar utilized a line of credit and other short term bank facilities of up to throughout mecar typically obtains relatively large orders for its ammunition and weapon systems which require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements with a multi member foreign bank syndicate 
while the bank syndicate agreement provides that mecar is responsible to repay the syndicate for amounts paid by the banks pursuant to the guarantees bonds  the financial terms stipulate that all such obligations be secured  in part  by a cash pledge 
at december   mecar s lenders had issued of guarantees performance bonds and mecar had pledged of cash 
the bank syndicate agreement provides the banks the right to review and approve each proposed mecar contract before they agree to provide the necessary guarantees bonds 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank syndicate structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be provided 
the bank syndicate agreement was amended and restated in mid march  the revised bank syndicate agreement provides increased credit support over the previous bank syndicate agreement  which includes an increase in the guarantee bond facility  which increase does not require any cash pledges 
the new agreement provides i lines of credit aggregating for tax prepayments and working capital and ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts of the revised bank syndicate agreement eliminates most restrictions on payments by mecar to allied or other allied group companies but substitutes financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
mecar s obligations under the revised bank syndicate agreement continues to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets and adds a second mortgage on mecar s facility 
the revised agreement provides for the release of the guarantee of arc europe and the pledge of the stock of the vsk group but retains allied s agreement to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its bank syndicate agreement obligations 
mecar has a mortgage loan with a foreign government agency which had an outstanding balance of approximately at december  principal and interest payments on the mortgage loan extend through january   and the loan includes a prepayment penalty clause 
the vsk group operated throughout primarily from cash generated from operations 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations with december  balances aggregating it is also obligated on letters of credit required by a contract with a customer 
on january   eleven member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
between january   and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
allied will continue to evaluate all issues involving the introduction of the euro as further accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance becomes available 
based on current information and allied s current assessment  allied does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
however  its operations in were adversely impacted by the fluctuations in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
in september  allied s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of allied s common stock 
during and  allied repurchased  and  shares of its common stock in market transactions 
the company did not repurchase shares in and does not anticipate repurchasing shares of company stock in calendar year allied s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar 
capital resources allied spent in on capital equipment as compared with in and in  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily for operating machinery and building upgrades 
management currently anticipates that it will spend approximately  across all the operations  on capital expenditures in for additional upgrades to its facilities and equipment 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 
the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years debt and capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations total amount other commercial commitments committed bank guarantees standby letters of credit total commercial commitments results of operations allied had revenues from continuing operations of in compared to in and to in  respectively 
allied earned profits from continuing operations of in and in compared to a loss of in excluded are contracts made in the normal course of business for performance of sales contracts or routine services  as well as commitments where contract provisions allow for cancellation 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue cost and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development operating income loss other income deductions interest income interest expense other net earnings loss before discontinued operation and income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings loss from continuing operations discontinued operation net earnings loss the following discussion of the components of the results of operations applies to allied as a whole unless reference is made to a particular segment 
revenues allied s consolidated revenues from continuing operations for decreased  or  from revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for increased  or  over revenues 
revenues by segment millions amount amount amount mecar vsk the fluctuation in mecar s revenues from the amount realized in results principally from a change in mecar s revenue base 
in  mecar began to receive subcontracts from the distributor as opposed to direct contracts from the end user customer 
as a result  in the majority of non fms revenue was via the distributor subcontracts 
these subcontracts generally have lower revenue value than mecar s traditional direct end user sales contracts  however  this subcontract arrangement does not reduce the company s gross margins since mecar s cost of sales are reduced as a result of its agreement with the distributor 
mecar s revenues for increased by over its revenues 
the increase in revenues over revenues is attributable to increased order levels for its products  after a downturn in business in revenues at the vsk group were essentially unchanged in as compared to in  revenues at the vsk group decreased approximately from levels 
if currency fluctuations are eliminated  and vsk group revenues were and greater than and revenues  respectively 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for was approximately compared with for and for the improvement in cost of sales in and results primarily from cost reductions and the increase in subcontracts via the distributor as explained under revenues 
certain fees  selling expenses and other customer related expenses in connection with direct sales to customers are not incurred on distributor subcontracts 
costs in were higher than normal as a result of rework costs on orders for certain customers 
selling and administrative expenses selling and general administrative expenses increased by in over expenses incurred in largely due to increased employment related charges at the parent company and increased costs associated with the review of acquisition opportunities 
selling and general administrative expenses in increased less than over research and development research and development costs incurred in decreased by from levels as a result of work load associated with contracts in process during the year 
research and development costs incurred in decreased by or from levels 
the reduction was also attributable to the work load associated with contracts in process during the year 
interest income interest income was essentially unchanged in from interest income decreased in by or from levels  principally due to decreased amounts of cash invested 
interest expense interest expenses incurred in increased by approximately compared to the amount incurred in largely due to increased borrowings at mecar 
interest expense increased in by or compared to the amount incurred in  principally as a result of an increase in borrowings at mecar via its line of credit 
other net other net results were a loss in and a gain in  largely due to foreign currency transactions at mecar and the vsk group 
pre tax profit from continuing operations pre tax profit loss by segment millions mecar vsk corporate and other mecar s pre tax profit was favorably impacted by profits earned on the supplemental contract described under trends in operations 
mecar s pre tax profit increase was largely attributable to the gross margins generated on incremental revenue 
mecar s loss resulted primarily from unanticipated costs to rework products for various customers 
the vsk group s pre tax profit increase in from its level was due to increased operating margins as a result of production efficiencies and lower administrative expenses 
the decrease in pre tax profit from was due to a long term high margin project which was completed in income taxes the effective income tax expense attributable to continuing operations in and was and  respectively  primarily due to foreign rate differentials and permanent tax differences 
the company reported a tax benefit relating to continuing operations in principally as a result of the deferred tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards attributable to mecar s operating losses  less belgium taxes attributable to the vsk group s operations and domestic tax expenses 
net earnings from continuing operations the company earned profits in and profits in from continuing operations  compared with loss in discontinued operations all results from discontinued operations reported by allied relate to the operations of bri and have been reported net of income tax expense or benefits 
the company s profit of from discontinued operations is principally comprised of gain on the sale of bri 
the company s loss from discontinued operations of in is from bri operations 
impact of year through march   the company has not experienced any significant problems related to the yk issue 
recent accounting pronouncements see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
except for the elimination of periodic amortization of goodwill and the substitution therefore of periodic goodwill impairment testing  allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at year end  allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than exchange rate sensitivity allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
virtually all of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from allied s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net earnings by approximately allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
