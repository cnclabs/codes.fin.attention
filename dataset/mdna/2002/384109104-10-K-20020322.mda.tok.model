a summary of recent actions follows o a ten percent increase in the regular dividend in  o a seven percent increase in the regular dividend in  o a percent increase in the regular dividend in  o three for two stock splits in  and  o repurchase of million shares in critical accounting policies the company believes that the selection and application of its accounting policies are appropriately reasoned 
the following are the accounting policies that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
sales returns 
an allowance is established for expenses and losses related to possible returns of products 
the amount of the allowance is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
warranty claims 
a liability is established for estimated warranty claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the amount of the warranty liability is based on historical ratios of warranty claims to sales  the historical average length of time between a sale and the resulting warranty claim and other factors 
changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation 
a reserve is established for estimated surplus and discontinued inventory items 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
doubtful accounts receivable 
an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing customer accounts and making estimates of the amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
product liability 
the company carries third party insurance for what it believes to be a substantial amount of potential product liability exposures 
the company has established a liability for potential uninsured claims 
the company employs a third party to evaluate its potential ultimate exposure for uninsured claims and then considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  sales trends and other relevant factors in setting the liability 
a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
accounting changes in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for the company at the beginning of upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company will stop amortization of goodwill  which would have been  of general and administrative expense in results of initial goodwill impairment testing indicate no impairment 
see note a to consolidated financial statements for discussion of other recent and pending accounting changes that were not  or are not expected to be significant to the company s financial position or operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk graco sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
graco uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce risks associated with foreign currency net monetary asset and liability positions 
these contracts typically have maturities of days or less  and gains or losses from changes in market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet items 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the european euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound  and korean won 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to evaluate its currency exchange rate risks on its foreign exchange contracts  the company uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact on earnings of hypothetical changes in the value of foreign currencies of its monetary assets and liabilities 
at december   due to the short term nature of the company s hedging instruments  reasonably likely fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect graco s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
when appropriate  the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
the amount of such debt was not significant at december  for further discussion of the company s foreign currency hedging strategy and position  see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook management believes that the tough economic environment will continue in the length and severity of the soft market conditions in north america  and the risk that it will spread  directly impacts the willingness and ability of graco s customers to purchase its equipment 
sales growth will be difficult as long as the weakness continues in north america  and management is concerned about continued softness in europe and japan 
nonetheless  management remains committed to improved profitability while funding the company s long term growth strategies of introducing new products  entering new markets  expanding distribution coverage and pursuing strategic acquisitions
