item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements for and later periods are made throughout this document 
such statements represent estimates of management based on the company s historical operating trends  its proved oil and gas reserves and other information currently available to management 
the company cautions that the forward looking statements provided herein are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident to the acquisition  development and marketing of  and exploration for oil and gas reserves 
these risks include  but are not limited to oil and natural gas price risk  environmental risk  drilling risk  reserve quantity risk and operations and production risks 
for all the above reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements and there is no assurance that the assumptions used are necessarily the most likely to occur 
general the company s principal line of business is the production and sale of its oil and natural gas reserves 
results of operations are dependent upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for such production 
prices received by the company for the sale of its oil and natural gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations affect the company s ability to maintain or increase its production from existing oil and gas properties and to explore  develop or acquire new properties 
the following table reflects certain operating data for the periods presented for the year ended september  production oil bbls    gas mcf    average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf results of operations compared to revenues total revenues increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was a direct result of increased sales volumes for both oil and natural gas offset by dramatically reduced sales prices for both oil and natural gas  as outlined in the above table 
the increased sales volume of both oil and natural gas is almost exclusively due to the addition of production from the wood oil acquisition properties 
wood oil s production volumes were  mcf of the gas volume increase and  barrels of the oil volume increase 
the reduction in average sales price was simply the result of world market conditions for crude oil and natural gas prices returning to more sustainable price levels from the ultra high prices of certain months in fiscal lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe increased  to  in of the increase was due to loe on the wood acquisition properties 
gross production taxes are paid as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues and thus fluctuate by increases in oil and gas sales revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs declined in as fewer exploratory wells were drilled in  thus  reducing the chance of an exploratory well being a dry hole  which under the successful effects accounting method are expensed as exploration costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a increased in or  the majority of the increase   was dd a on the wood acquisition properties 
the dd a on these properties was calculated using the fair value of the properties which was assigned in the purchase accounting done at the acquisition date 
in addition  a full year of dd a on many wells completed late in was recognized in drilling and completion costs in fiscal were extremely high as drilling rigs and completion equipment enjoyed high utilization rates during the year 
these high costs were thus being amortized in provision for impairment the provision for impairment increased or  in the increase is due again to the high costs of drilling and equipping wells in coupled with disappointing production volumes on several wells  resulting in impairment on those fields and several individual wells 
general and administrative costs g a g a increased  in or 
the majority of the increase was due to g a associated with wood oil and the three employees retained from wood 
additionally one other employee was hired during year and personnel related expenses including salaries  payroll taxes  insurance expense and esop expense increased in during the year 
interest expense interest expense increased by  in the increase is due to interest paid on the loan used to acquire wood oil 
the acquisition was funded by a new  five year term loan which requires monthly principal and interest payments 
at september  the interest rate on the term loan was 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased in due to a much lower income before taxes 
the company continues to be able to utilize tax credits from production of tight gas sands natural gas and excess percentage depletion on its oil and gas properties 
the effective tax rate was approximately in the aggregate income tax benefit of  in  was primarily a result of percentage depletion and tight gas sands credits reducing the expected federal income tax expense by approximately  overview the company recorded net income of  in  compared to net income of  in this decrease was the result of lower oil and gas natural sales prices and increased loe  dd a  impairment  g a and interest expense 
the increased expenses  for the most part  were a result of the wood oil acquisition 
compared to revenues total revenues increased to  in compared to  in the increase was due to a large increase in the average sales price for natural gas in  offset some what by a decrease in gas production volumes in the decreased sales volumes were principally due to decreased sales from the potato hills field in southeast oklahoma  as normal production decline takes place 
additionally  nationwide gas storage facilities filled quickly as summer approached  limiting demand for natural gas in the summer months 
lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe continues to increase each year as the company increases the number of working interest wells in which it has an interest 
the company participated in a record number of working interest wells in gross production taxes are paid as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues and thus fluctuate by increases in oil and gas sales revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs increased  or in as compared to the increased costs were primarily dry hole costs 
as previously mentioned  the company participated in a record number of wells in  many of which were exploratory 
as the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations  dry holes resulted in the expensing of all costs associated with those wells 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a declined  or in the decline was principally due to decreased gas production volume in  reducing the units of production dd a on the company s oil and gas properties 
general and administrative costs g a g a costs increased  in the increase was the result of the company paying an investment banking firm  to provide a valuation of the company  strategic planning and other advice 
in addition  personnel related expenses including salaries  payroll taxes  insurance expenses and esop expenses increased approximately  in these increases were offset by a reduction in g a expense related to the non employee directors deferred compensation plan the plan 
this decease was a result of the company recognizing a charge to general and administrative expense of approximately  to adjust the potential shares in the plan to market price at september   verses a comparable charge to expense of approximately  for the non employee directors have taken these potential shares  rather than a cash payment for their directors fees 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased in  due to a much larger income before taxes as discussed above 
the company continued to be able to utilize tax credits from production of tight gas sands natural gas and excess percentage depletion on its oil and gas properties to reduce its tax liability  and an effective tax rate from the federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate was approximately in and in liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had a working capital deficit of  as compared to  at september  the decrease is the result of the  current portion of the  term loan used to fund the acquisition of wood oil company on october  monthly payments on the term loan of  plus  accrued interest began on december  cash provided by operating activities was  for   for and  for the company s expenditures for oil and gas activities for amounted to  exclusive of  used to acquire wood oil company 
in  these expenditures amounted to  and in were  these expenditures are discretionary and increased in as prices for both oil and gas increased causing a substantial increase in the number of wells being drilled  thus  increasing the actual costs of drilling and completing wells 
the decrease in  resulted from dramatically decreased oil and gas prices  thus  causing an industry wide reduction in the number of wells being drilled which reduced the costs of drilling and equiping wells 
historically  the company has funded its capital expenditures  overhead expenditures and dividend payments from operating cash flow 
with the addition of the monthly payments required on the term loan  the company has utilized as of december    of the  line of credit to help fund these expenditures 
management expects to borrow additional funds under the line of credit during the coming fiscal year  as needs arise  to help fund drilling costs 
currently  cash provided from operating activities is expected to increase in  as prices received for natural gas sales are projected to exceed the prices 
however  capital expenditures are also projected to be increased over levels 
the company has the potential availability of equity  which could be offered in a public or private placement  if additional capital were needed for capital expenditures or for debt reduction 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not change the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgements made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgements and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  impairment of assets and tax accruals 
management s judgements and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  geologists and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known 
oil and gas reserves of these judgements and estimates  management considers the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves to be the most significant 
changes in crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates affect the company s calculation of depreciation and depletion  provision for abandonment and assessment of the need for asset impairments 
the company s consulting engineer with assistance from company geologists prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
as required by the guidelines and definitions established by the securities and exchange commission  these estimates are based on current crude oil and natural gas pricing 
as previously discussed  crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide consumption and are outside the control of management 
projected future crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions are used by management to prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves used in formulating managements overall operating decisions in the exploration and production segment 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by field using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
the accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
impairment of assets all long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgement since the results are based on estimated future events  such as inflation rates  future sales prices for oil and gas  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the company approves the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
tax accruals the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
operations and cash flows are also impacted by changes in the market interest rates related to the revolving credit facility and the million five year term loan  both bearing interest at an annual variable interest rate equal to the national prime rate minus 
a one percent change in the prime interest rate would result in approximately a  change in annual interest expense
