as of august  the company sold the assets of nu visions manufacturing inc nu visions  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which was a contract assembler of circuit boards and related electromechanical devices for various oem s 
the financial information presented herein includes i balance sheets as of february   and february   ii statements of income for the twelve month periods ended february   february  and february   iii statements of cash flows for the twelve month periods ended february   february  and february   and iv consolidated changes in shareholders equity for the twelve month periods ended february   february  and february  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues at time of shipment of its products and sales are recorded net of discounts and returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their inability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon product franchise agreements governing price protection  stock rotation and obsolescence  as page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories could be required 
fiscal year versus results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   a decrease of  or approximately 
management attributes this decrease in sales for the period to the core semiconductor and passive component distribution business  which experienced substantially decreased demand 
toward the latter part of the fourth quarter of our prior fiscal year  we and the market place overall began to experience a significant decline in demand for electronic components 
this reduced demand has continued throughout fiscal management believes and expects that the current slowdown has stabilized but will extend at least through the first half of fiscal as a result  we expect revenues to continue to range from flat to a moderate upside potential through the first three quarters of fiscal gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  it should also be noted that the gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of the current year was 
this continuing decrease in gross margin reflects decreasing prices due to increased competitive pressures resulting from the industry wide decline in demand coupled with an oversupply of product in the marketplace 
as a result management believes that there could be some continued margin pressure in the first half of fiscal  with a return to relative margin stability in the second half of fiscal  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
operating expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   a decrease of approximately 
the dollar decrease in operating expenses was due to decreases in the following expense categories approximately  or approximately of the decrease was for personnel related costs commissions  salaries  travel and fringe benefits 
the remaining decrease of approximately  or approximately of the total is a result of decreases in various other general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales  however  increased to of sales as compared to for the prior year 
the sharp reduction in sales has resulted in higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales and a loss of the economies of scale the company enjoyed in its prior fiscal year 
management has decided to endure this higher rate of operating expenses in order to be prepared for what we believe will be an inevitable rebound for the industry  although no assurances can be given as to the timing or size of any rebound 
interest expense decreased by  from  for the year ended february  to  for the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to the lower average levels of bank debt during the year resulting from the decrease in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels required to support reduced sales activity  repayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale of the nu visions manufacturing nuv subsidiary and substantially lower interest rates overall 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share  as compared to income of  or per basic share and per diluted share  for the year ended february  management attributes  of the loss for fiscal to reduced sales volumes  resulting in a greater decrease in gross profit margin dollars than in operating expenses 
the remaining loss of  is attributable to a one time charge for the impairment of the value of goodwill  which had previously been amortized over a fifteen year period 
discontinued operations on august   the company completed the sale of the assets of its contract manufacturing subsidiary  nu visions 
the selling price was paid with a  subordinated note and  in cash 
net income from the discontinued operation for the year ended february  was  or 
per basic and diluted share as compared to  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share the year before 
the net gain on the sale of the subsidiary resulted in an after tax profit of  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share for the current year 
this resulted in total net income from the discontinued operation for the year ended february  of  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share as compared to  or

per diluted in the prior year 
combined net income net income from both continuing and discontinued operations combined for the year ended february  was  or 
per diluted share as compared to  or per diluted share the year before 
fiscal year versus results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately 
management attributes this increase in sales for the period to the core semiconductor and passive component distribution business  which experienced substantially increased demand 
management believes that the ability to generate greater market penetration to a larger account base coupled with an increased focus on fewer product lines  contributed to the substantial increase in sales performance 
toward the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal we and the market place overall began to experience a significant decline in demand for electronic components 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  this increase in gross margin percentage compared to the prior period resulted from tightened inventory availability at the supplier level coupled with continued strong customer demand through the third quarter 
operating expenses increased by  to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   an increase of approximately 
the dollar increase in operating expenses was due to increases in the following expense categories approximately  or approximately of the increases were for personnel related costs commissions  salaries  travel and fringe benefits 
the remaining increase of approximately  or approximately of the total increment is a result of increases in various other operating expenses including  but not limited to  freight out  rent  telephone  computer expenses and various general and administrative expenses 
while operating expenses  expressed in dollars  for fiscal increased approximately over fiscal  those same expenses  as a percentage of sales dollars  decreased from for the prior year to page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the fiscal year 
management was encouraged by the fact that sales volume increased at a greater rate than operating expenses  which it believed provided the economies of scale that were required to produce an enhanced bottom line performance 
interest expense increased by  from  for the year ended february  to  for the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to the higher average levels of bank debt during the year resulting from an increase in the company s inventories and accounts receivable levels needed to support increased sales activity coupled with higher interest rates overall

on october   the company entered into a new unsecured revolving line of credit with six banks  which currently provides for maximum borrowings of  at either i the lead bank s prime rate or ii libor plus to basis points depending on the ratio of the company s debt to its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  at the option of the company through october  borrowings under this line of credit decreased from  at february  to  at february  the primary reason for the decrease was lower borrowings needed due to reductions in inventories and receivables as a result of the significant decline in sales and repayment of amounts outstanding under the line of credit from the proceeds of the sale of the nu visions manufacturing subsidiary 
the company does not expect a fluctuation in interest rates to have a material effect on its financial results 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has contacted the lead bank under its loan agreement to discuss an amendment to the current loan agreement to address the company s reduced need for credit and to amend certain of the financial covenants contained therein 
the company is currently in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in its loan agreement 
however  the company believes that there is a risk that  due to the overall decline in sales in the electronic components market  without an amendment to the loan agreement  commencing in august  the company may violate the covenant related to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the lead bank has advised the company that all of the lenders under the company s loan agreement are willing to enter into an amendment to the loan agreement that would enable the company to remain in compliance with all covenants  as revised  for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurances that the company and its lenders will actually enter into such an agreement 
the company anticipates that its resources provided by its cash flow from operations and its bank lines of credit  as amended  will be sufficient to meet its financing requirements for at least the next twelve month period 
inflationary impact since the inception of operations  inflation has not significantly affected the operating results of the company 
however  inflation and changing interest rates have had a significant effect on the economy in general and therefore could affect the operating results of the company in the future 
forward looking statement disclaimer except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth above may be forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as the level of business and consumer spending for electronic products  the amounts of sales of the company s products  the competitive environment within the electronic industry  the ability of the company to continue to expand its operations and the level of costs incurred in connection therewith  economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and the financial strength of the company s customers and suppliers 
investors are also directed to consider other risks and uncertainties discussed in documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
market and other business risks the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate 
if market rates increase  the impact could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company has several foreign subsidiaries and acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s financial results in future periods 
the electronic component industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross margins and profits  from year to year 
for example  during calendar  the industry experienced a severe decline in the demand for electronic components  which caused sales to decrease by 
the prior year reflected a increase in net sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic component industry
