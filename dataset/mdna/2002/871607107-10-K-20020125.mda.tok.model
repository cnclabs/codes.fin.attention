during fiscal  ic implementation products accounted for of the company s revenues 
logic synthesis is the process by which a high level description of desired chip functions is mapped into a connected collection of logic gates and other circuit elements that perform the desired functions 
design compiler tm is the market leading logic synthesis tool and is used by a broad range of companies engaged in the design of ics to optimize their designs for performance and area 
design compiler was introduced in and has been updated regularly since then 
the company s design compiler product family also includes power compiler and module compiler 
power compiler provides push button power optimization and early analysis for the design of low power circuits  which are key for the design of hand held devices 
module compiler is used in the design of complex datapaths 
in fiscal  synopsys released design compiler as the latest generation in the design compiler family 
design compiler features significant enhancements  including improved optimization algorithms  run times and capacity 
over time  synopsys expects that a significant portion of the existing design compiler license base will be upgraded to physical compiler discussed below  although design compiler will continue to be an important element in designers overall suite of design tools  especially for performing logic synthesis on non timing critical portions of a design 
physical synthesis unites logic synthesis  placement and  in the future  routing and links them together with common timing 
when used together  the physical synthesis suite of products provides customers with an integrated design flow from register transfer level through placement and routing  and addresses the critical timing problems encountered in designing advanced ics and systems on a chip 
physical compiler  released by the company in  unifies synthesis and placement in a single product in order to greatly improve designers ability to achieve timing closure 
as of october  physical compiler had been licensed to over customers and more than ic designs had been completed using the product 
during fiscal  the company received approximately million in orders for physical compiler 
the physical synthesis suite of products also includes chip architect  flexroute  clocktree compiler  and route compiler 
chip architect is a hierarchical design planner  which takes into account physical phenomena and is used at various stages of the system on a chip design process to perform chip level estimation  floor planning  timing analysis and placement

furthermore  fpgas unique ability to deliver very quick time to market make them attractive in today s business environment 
an enhanced version of fpga compiler ii tm offering enhanced synthesis for xilinx and altera fpga devices was released in fiscal verification and test products the company s verification and test products consist of a group of tools  including simulation  test automation and timing verification products  to enable ic designers to quickly and reliably verify the behavior of a design before it is committed to the expensive and time consuming process of ic fabrication  and to assist in the testing of the chip after manufacturing 
during fiscal  verification and test products accounted for of the company s revenues 
simulation and related products 
simulation software exercises an ic design by running it through a series of tests and comparing the actual outputs from the design with the expected output 
as such  simulation products are the key products for functional verification 
the goal of simulation is to make sure that the functionality of the design meets the original specifications of the chip 
synopsys offers two products for high level simulation vcs tm  for designs written in verilog one of the two principal languages and scirocco tm  for designs written in vhdl the other principal language 
simulation products are distinguished principally by their runtime and capacity ie  how fast they can fully simulate a proposed design and how large a design they can handle 
the company is focused on providing the industry s fastest and highest capacity simulation technology and believes that both vcs and scirocco are industry leaders in performance and capacity 
vcs is supported by all major semiconductor manufacturers and many third party eda software providers 
in addition to focusing on building the fastest simulator  synopsys is focused on developing a suite of products that help simulation products work smarter 
the company estimates that more time is spent in writing verification testbenches than in creating the design description 
testbenches  which create stimuli for chips and check the results  are used in conjunction with simulation tools to verify that a design functions as expected 
synopsys provides software that helps generate and manage testbenches as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation process 
vera r is a tool that automates the design of testbenches  thereby offering the ic designer significant reductions in overall design and verification time 
vera provides a high level language designed specifically for verifying complex designs 
vera is integrated with the company s other simulation products 
test automation 
in order to meet today s stringent quality requirements  chips must pass through rigorous testing after manufacturing

synopsys dft compiler  the industry standard pass test synthesis product  inserts all functional and test logic required to enable efficient  high coverage testing of the chip after manufacturing  while complying with the customer s design rules and constraints timing  area  power  etc dft compiler works seamlessly with design compiler and physical compiler  with the added benefit  in the case of physical compiler  of placement driven optimization of test logic 
dft compiler was awarded the best in test award from test measurement world  an industry journal 
the award is presented annually to honor important and innovative products in the electronics test and measurement industry 
automatic test pattern generation atpg is the other component of synopsys complete dft solution 
tetramax tm atpg  the company s atpg product is optimized for ease of use  capacity  speed  coverage and vector compaction 
tetramax atpg works in concert with dft compiler to enable total automation of the dft flow 
synopsys test methodology also includes software to facilitate the failure diagnosis of chips after manufacturing test  expediting the time consuming and expensive post fabrication activities required to determine the cause of manufacturing defects 
static timing analysis 
synopsys provides a complete tool suite to help designers perform static timing analysis at the gate and transistor levels and analyze signal integrity issues such as cross talk 
synopsys gate level analysis tool is called primetime r 
primetime is a full chip  gate level static timing analysis tool targeted for complex multimillion gate designs  which is used by designers to verify  at various stages of the design process  the speed at which a design will operate when it is fabricated 
primetime s analysis of a design s speed is accepted as a sign off tool by virtually all major semiconductor manufacturers  which means that they accept its analysis as determinative 
synopsys transistor level timing analysis products are described below under transistor level design 
in fiscal  synopsys extended primetime s capabilities with the introduction of primetime si  which analyzes the effect of cross talk on timing  an increasingly important issue at chip geometries below micron 
formal verification equivalence checking 
formal verification is a method for comparing two versions of a design to determine if they are equivalent 
usually an rtl version of the design is validated using simulation and other dynamic verification tools  establishing it as the golden version 
subsequent versions ie  after each step of the design process are then compared to the golden version  using mathematical algorithms  to determine if they are functionally equivalent 
the use of formal verification greatly reduces the need to perform simulation  which is substantially more time consuming  at each stage of the design process  thus potentially saving a significant amount of time in the overall design process 
synopsys formal verification product is formality r 
formality was one of the industry s first commercial equivalency checkers to employ a multi solver architecture  which enables the verification of complex multimillion gate system on a chip designs in days or minutes 
intellectual property ip and systems level design the company s ip and systems level design products include our designware ip library and systems design and verification products 
during fiscal  ip and systems level design products accounted for of the company s revenues 
intellectual property products 
as ic designs continue to grow in size  reusing design blocks is becoming a more important method for reducing overall design cycle time 
by reusing portions of a design  and particularly those that implement basic or standardized functions  a company can let its ic design team focus on designing the chip features that will give its product a competitive advantage 
it can also reduce its verification risk by ensuring that these portions of the chip are of high quality 
enabling reuse of intellectual property ip requires a significant methodology shift from traditional ic design 
in the past  designs were intimately tied to a particular semiconductor process technology or design methodology  making reuse of design blocks from one chip design to the next  both difficult and costly 
synopsys designware r product provides ic designers with a single library of pre designed and pre verified synthesizable ip cores as well as over  verification ip models 
the synthesizable ip cores range in complexity from simple adders and multipliers to pci x and usb cones 
the verification ip models range in complexity from standard xx ttl parts to models of complex bus interface protocols

competition the eda industry is highly competitive 
we compete against other eda vendors  and with customers internally developed design tools and internal design capabilities for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential customers 
in general  competition is based on product quality and features  post sale support  price and  as discussed below  the ability to offer a complete design flow 
our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services  such as cadence design systems  inc  avant and mentor graphics corporation  as well as companies  including numerous start up companies  that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the integrated circuit design process 
in certain situations  synopsys competitors have been offering aggressive discounts on certain of their products  in particular simulation and synthesis products 
as a result  average prices for these products may fall 
in order to compete successfully  we must continue to enhance our products and bring to market new products that address the needs of our customers 
we also will have to expand our consulting services business 
the failure to enhance existing products  develop and or acquire new products or expand our ability to offer consulting services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change in the nature of competition among eda vendors 
increasingly  eda companies compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design products rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design process 
a number of companies  including  cadence  avant  magma design  synplicity and monterey design  are developing or selling products that link logic and physical design 
the need to offer such design flow synthesis products will become increasingly important  as ics grow more complex 
in fiscal  we announced new products that would extend our design flow through physical design  and begin working with target customers to prepare such products for broader release 
if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete design flow on a timely basis or in convincing customers to adopt our integrated logical and physical design products and methodology  our competitive position could be significantly weakened 
product sales and licensing agreements synopsys typically licenses its software to customers under non exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and that restrict use of the software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas 
the company currently licenses the majority of its software as a network license that allows a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network 
license fees are dependent on the type of license  product mix and number of copies of each product licensed 
synopsys currently offers its software products under either a perpetual license or a short term ratable license 
under a perpetual license a customer pays a one time license fee for the right to use the software 
the vast majority of customers buying perpetual licenses also purchase annual software support services for perpetual licenses  under which they receive minor enhancements to the products developed during the year  bug fixes and technical assistance 
a ratable license  and the various forms of time based licenses that the company has offered before introducing ratable licenses  operates like a rental of software which typically includes software support services 
a customer pays a fee for license and support over a fixed period of time  and at the end of the time period the license expires unless the customer pays for a renewal 
ratable licenses are offered with a range of terms  the average length is approximately to years 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations revenue 
over the past several years  orders for time based licenses now ratable licenses have increased significantly as a percentage of total product orders 
during fiscal  orders for time based licenses  including ratable licenses  accounted for of total product orders compared to in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal synopsys expects that orders for ratable licenses will account for approximately to of total product orders and orders for perpetual licenses approximately to of total product orders

fiscal year will be a week year 
for presentation purposes  the consolidated financial statements refer to the calendar month end 
prior to fiscal year  synopsys fiscal year ended on the saturday nearest to september the period from october  through october  was a transition period 
during the transition period  revenue  loss before income taxes  benefit for income taxes and net loss were million  million  million  and million  respectively  and basic and diluted loss per share was 
the net loss during the transition period is due to the fact that sales in the first month following a quarter end are historically weak

on october   synopsys sold a segment of the viewlogic business for million in cash 
as a result of the transaction  synopsys recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of income tax expense  in the fourth quarter of fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of for example  statements including terms such as projects  expects  believes  anticipates or targets are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results 
results of operations introduction of technology subscription licenses tsls 
on july   we introduced tsls  which are time limited rights to use our software 
since tsls include bundled product and services  both product and service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license  or  if later  as payments become due 
the terms of tsls  and the payments due thereon  may be structured flexibly to meet the needs of the customer 
with minor exceptions  under tsls  customers cannot obtain major new products developed or acquired during the term of their license without making an additional purchase 
overall  we believe that tsls have enabled us to i offer customers technology and terms that more closely match their needs  ii have greater visibility into our earnings stream  iii more effectively resist customer requests for special end of the quarter discounts  and iv roll out our new technologies in a more planned manner 
the replacement of the prior form of time based licenses by tsls has impacted and will continue to impact our reported revenue 
under a ratable license  relatively little revenue is recognized during the quarter the product is delivered 
the remaining amount is recorded as deferred revenue to the extent that the license fee has been paid or invoiced  to be recognized over the term of the license  or is considered backlog by the company 
this backlog is not recorded on our balance sheet 
under the prior form of time based licenses  a high proportion of all license revenue was recognized in the quarter that the product was delivered  with relatively little recorded as deferred revenue or as backlog 
therefore  an order for a tsl will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized order under the prior form of time based license 
we set revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain license mix of perpetual licenses and tsls 
the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets 
in fiscal  our license mix for new orders was tsls and perpetual licenses which is within our targeted range 
the average term of our tsl licenses sold in was between and years  which is longer than expected 
given the difference in the revenue profile of tsls and perpetual licenses  this shift in license mix will reduce revenue in the short term 
we anticipate that our license mix for fiscal will be approximately to perpetual licenses and to tsls 
business combinations and divestitures 
on january   we sold the assets of our silicon libraries business to artisan components  inc artisan for a total sales price of million  including common stock with a fair value on the date of sale of million  and cash of million 
the net book value of the assets sold was million 
expenses incurred in connection with the sale were million 
we recorded a gain on the sale of the business of million  which is included in other income  net 
direct revenue for the silicon libraries business was million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
there were no business combinations completed in fiscal in fiscal  we acquired i virsim  a software product  from innoveda  inc  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash  ii the silicon group  inc  a privately held provider of integrated circuit design and intellectual property integration services  for a purchase price of million  including cash payments of million and a reserve of approximately  shares of common stock for issuance under the silicon group s stock option plan which was assumed in the transaction  and iii leda  sa leda  a privately held provider of rtl coding style checkers  for a purchase price of million  including cash payments of million 
approximately million of the leda purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the purchase price of each of these transactions was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the respective acquisition 
amounts allocated to developed technology  workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to five years 
in fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of common stock for all the outstanding stock of everest  a developer of integrated circuit routing and related technology  and reserved approximately  shares of common stock for issuance under everest s stock option plan  which we assumed in the transaction 
the business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the financial position and results of everest for all periods prior to the merger date 
in fiscal  we acquired i gambit automated design  inc gambit  a privately held provider of place and route software and physical design services for a purchase price of million including  million in cash  million in notes payable and a reserve of approximately  shares of common stock for issuance under gambit s stock option plan which was assumed in the transaction  ii stanza systems  inc stanza  a privately held company with physical layout editor expertise and technology for a purchase price of million including  million in cash  the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock and a reserve of approximately  shares of common stock for issuance under stanza s stock option plan which was assumed in the transaction  iii smartech oy  a privately held design services firm with expertise in the design of wireless communication devices for a purchase price of approximately million in cash  iv the rights to covermeter  a verilog code coverage tool  from advanced technology center of massachusetts covermeter for a purchase price of million including million in cash and million of notes payable  and v apteq  inc apteq which has an expertise in analog simulation and verilog a product for a purchase price of million including million in cash  notes payable of million and million in the assumption of debt 
amounts allocated to in process research and development and charged to operations because the acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses were i million for gambit ii million for stanza  iii million for covermeter and iv million for apteq 
the purchase price of each of the transactions was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the respective acquisition 
amounts allocated to developed technology  workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to five years 
revenue 
revenue consists of fees for perpetual and ratable licenses of the company s software products  sales of hardware system products  post contract customer support pcs  customer training and consulting 
we classify revenues as product  service or ratable license 
product revenue consists primarily of perpetual and non ratable time based license revenue 
service revenue consists of pcs under perpetual and non ratable time based licenses and fees for consulting services and training 
ratable license revenue consists of revenue from tsls and from time based licenses that include extended payment terms or unspecified additional products 
revenue for fiscal decreased to million  as compared to million for fiscal  consistent with our expectations 
the decrease in revenue in compared to is due to the utilization for the full fiscal year of the ratable license model and the related inherent decrease in revenue due to the timing of revenue recognition under this license model 
product revenue decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to the change in the license model to tsls  for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license 
service revenue consists of consulting revenue  training and pcs on perpetual licenses 
service revenue remained relatively flat at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal service revenue in the first half of fiscal was million  compared to million for the same period in fiscal this increase was a result of increased sales of our turnkey design and wireless and broadband consulting services 
however  full fiscal year services revenue was impacted by cost cutting efforts by customers during the second half of the fiscal year  which led to rescheduling of delivery dates on certain consulting projects and cancellation of others 
as a result  projects anticipated to produce revenue in the second half of fiscal were not completed 
assuming no improvement in the current economic climate  the company anticipates that customers will continue to review their engagements with outside consultants  and may eliminate or defer those determined to be non critical 
during fiscal  service revenue increased by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the renewal of maintenance and support contracts for eda products and growth in customer training and consulting services 
over time  service revenue will be impacted by three trends 
first  new licenses are increasingly structured as tsls including the bundled pcs 
second  customers with existing perpetual licenses are increasingly entering into new tsls rather than renewing the pcs on the existing perpetual license 
third  customers with existing perpetual licenses are increasingly converting their existing licenses to tsls 
each of these trends will result  over time  in lower service revenue 
ratable license revenue was million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  ratable revenue equaled million  million  million and million for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  increasing on a sequential quarter basis in each quarter of the year 
we expect sequential increases to continue through fiscal international revenue 
the following table summarizes the performance of the various geographic regions as a percent of total company revenue year ended october  october  september  north america europe japan other total revenue from international operations was million  million and million  or  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in any given period  the geographic mix of revenue is influenced by the particular contracts closed during that quarter  although the fluctuation on geographical mix should become less pronounced as the ratable revenue model continues to phase in 
the decline in international revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due to a decline in the revenue contribution from japan 
the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of relatively greater revenue growth in japan 
revenue expectations 
during fiscal  we expect revenue to consist of approximately perpetual licenses  tsls and services 
due to the current economic environment  we do not currently have sufficient visibility into revenues for the full fiscal year to be able to forecast such full year revenues with a reasonable accuracy 
these expectations do not take into account the potential impact of the proposed mergers with avant  inc and ikos systems  inc 
revenue product groups 
for management reporting purposes  our products have been organized into four distinct product groups ic implementation  verification and test  intellectual property ip and system level design  transistor level design and a services group professional services 
the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to the various groups and as a percentage of total company revenue since the introduction of the ratable license model q q q q q revenue ic implementation dc family      physical synthesis      verification and test      ip and system level design      transistor level design      professional services      total company      ic implementation 
ic implementation includes two product categories  the design compiler dc family and physical synthesis 
the dc family includes design compiler  our core logic synthesis product  power compiler  which permits optimization of the design of low power circuits  and module compiler  which is used in the design of complex datapaths 
quarterly revenue from the dc family has increased since the introduction of our ratable license model  from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of this increase is driven by a continued increase in revenues from design compiler 
as a percentage of total revenue  the dc family has remained relatively flat over the last five quarters  ranging from to 
while we expect the relative revenue contribution from the dc family to decline over time as our customers transition from the dc family products to physical synthesis products  design compiler remains one of our top selling products 
included in the physical synthesis family is physical compiler  a product that unifies synthesis  placement and global routing  chip architect  a chip floor planning product  and our detailed routing technology 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced our route compiler and clocktree compiler products 
quarterly revenue from this product family has increased sequentially over the last five quarters with the exception of the first quarter of the overall increase in quarterly sales is related primarily to an increase in revenues from physical compiler 
the decrease in revenue in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of is due to the mix of license types sold in the quarter  specifically  fewer perpetual licenses were sold in that quarter compared to the preceding and following quarters 
verification and test 
verification and test includes our simulation  timing analysis  formal verification and test products 
revenue has increased in each quarter since the introduction of our ratable license model 
these sequential increases are primarily due to growth in revenue for our verilog simulator  vcs and prime time 
intellectual property ip and systems products 
our ip and systems products group includes the designware library of design components and verification models  and system design products 
revenue increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal  primarily due to increased designware revenue 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our silicon libraries business  which contributed direct revenue of million and million  in the first quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was a decrease in revenue as compared to the third quarter of fiscal from our designware product of approximately million due to an increase in the average term of the subscription or ratable licenses in fiscal in comparison to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also discontinued our eagle product  which in fiscal and contributed direct revenue of million and million  respectively 
transistor level design 
our transistor level design product group includes tools that are used in transistor level simulation and analysis 
revenue in total  and as a percent of total company revenue  from this product group has fluctuated since the introduction of tsls as a result of the mix of license types of orders received 
the decline in the fourth quarter is due primarily to an increase in the percentage of ratable licenses during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
professional services 
the professional services group includes consulting and training 
this group provides consulting services  including design methodology assistance  specialized telecommunications systems design services and turnkey design 
revenue from professional services increased quarterly from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of as a result of increased sales of our turnkey design and wireless and broadband consulting services 
however  in the third quarter of  revenue from professional services declined in comparison to the previous quarter and decreased an additional in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the third quarter 
these decreases in service revenue in the second half of fiscal are the result of certain consulting projects  which were not completed as delivery dates were pushed out to future periods or canceled by customers 
this was caused by the tightening economy 
due to the current economic climate  customers may continue to reduce costs  cancel orders or extend the delivery dates on existing purchase orders 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue includes personnel and related costs  production costs  product packaging  documentation  amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased technology  and costs of the components of the our hardware system products 
the cost of internally developed capitalized software is amortized based on the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or the straight line method over the software s estimated economic life of approximately two years 
cost of product revenue was of total product revenue for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal this increase in cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue is due primarily to the write off of certain eagle intangible assets totaling million and an increase in the inventory reserve totaling million related to our hardware modeling product because we are transitioning customers to the next generation product 
the company s product costs are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or changes in revenue recognition methods 
cost of product revenue was of total product revenue for fiscal cost of service revenue includes consulting services  personnel and the related costs associated with providing training  and pcs on perpetual licenses 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of total service revenue has remained relatively flat at in fiscal  in fiscal and in since tsls include bundled product and services  cost of ratable license revenue includes the costs of product and services related to our tsls 
cost of ratable license revenue was for fiscal because cost of product and tsl revenue is based on the mix of orders  as customers migrate to the tsl model  cost of product revenue will decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
over time  as more tsl deferred revenue is amortized  cost of tsl revenue will also decrease as a percentage of revenue 
during fiscal  we expect that the cost of product revenue as a percent of total product revenue will remain flat and the cost of tsl revenue as a percent of total tsl revenue will either remain flat or decrease slightly 
the cost of service revenue as a percent of the related revenue is also expected to remain relatively flat or decrease slightly 
research and development 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized software development costs  in terms of annual spending  remained relatively flat at million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and increased by in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in absolute dollars between and reflects increases in personnel related costs  recruiting costs and depreciation expense offset by a decrease in facilities due to certain facilities which were acquired in the gambit acquisition and closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as decreases in equipment repairs  advertising expenses and travel and entertainment costs 
research and development expenses represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue is due to the decrease in total revenues as a result of a change in our license model 
the increase in research and development spending in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in personnel and related costs as a result of business combinations and higher levels of research and development staffing in support of our roll out of physical compiler 
in each year  additions of personnel were made to facilitate the enhancement of existing applications and development of new products 
we believe that to maintain our competitive position in a market characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement  we must continue to invest significant resources in new systems and software  and continue to enhance existing products 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal total expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of decreases in annual bonuses  travel  consulting expenses  recruiting  advertising and depreciation expense  offset by increases in personnel related costs 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a decrease in total revenue as a result of the change in our license model 
total expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in sales commissions and bonus costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expense increased from million in fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal due to increases in bad debt expense  facility expenditures and consulting services related to the upgrade of our current computer systems offset by a decrease in personnel costs 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a decrease in total revenue as a result of the change to our license model 
in fiscal  the increase in absolute dollars and percentage of revenue compared to fiscal was primarily due in part to increases  in order of magnitude  in personnel costs  an increase in bad debt expense relating to the accounts receivable allowance provided in accordance with our historical trends  facility expenditures and patent and proxy services 
operating expense targets fiscal as a result of our cost cutting measures implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal and affecting expense levels in fiscal  we expect that total operating expenses for the full fiscal year will be relatively flat compared to fiscal levels 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets represent the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired by the company goodwill 
under our accounting policies  intangible assets as of october   including goodwill  are being amortized over the estimated useful life of three to five years 
amortization of intangible assets charged to operations amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
in fiscal  we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value 
approximately million and million are included in cost of revenues and amortization of intangible assets  respectively  on the statement of operations 
the impairment charge is attributable to certain technology acquired from  and goodwill related to the acquisition of eagle design automation  inc in during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology and we do not anticipate any future sales of the product 
there were no impairments of intangible assets in fiscal and in process research and development 
the following paragraphs contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements and assumptions regarding percentage of completion  expected product release dates  dates for which we expect to begin generating benefits from projects  expected product capabilities and product life cycles  costs and efforts to complete projects  growth rates  royalty rates and projected revenue and expense information used by us to calculate discounted cash flows and discount rates 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and the cautionary statements set forth below and in factors that may affect future results identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward looking statement 
purchased in process research and development iprd of million and million in fiscal and respectively  represent the write off of in process technologies associated with our acquisitions of leda in fiscal and gambit  stanza  covermeter  and apteq  in fiscal at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were expensed on the respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired companies 
also see note  business combinations  of notes to synopsys consolidated financial statements 
valuation of iprd 
we calculated amounts allocated to iprd using established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and expensed such amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no alternative future uses had been identified 
in each of the acquisitions that had associated significant iprd charges during fiscal and  the valuation of iprd was determined as discussed in the next three paragraphs 
information specific to the significant iprd charges in and follows 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the value of in process technology was then segmented into two classifications i in process technology completed and ii in process technology to be completed  giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by synopsys after the acquisition 
these value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors i time based data  ii cost based data and iii complexity based data 
the value of the in process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
under this approach  the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification segments 
revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules iv product sales cycles  and v the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
from the revenue estimates  operating expense estimates  including costs of sales  general and administrative  selling and marketing  income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets  were deducted to arrive at operating income 
revenue growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
operating expense estimates reflect our historical expense ratios 
additionally  these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of the acquisition 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that we will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology is our weighted average cost of capital wacc  taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise  and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at this time 
gambit 
in march  the company acquired gambit 
upon consummation of the gambit acquisition  we immediately recognized expense of million representing the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
at the date of the acquisition  the principal in process technologies identified were gambit s integrated circuit routing and clock tree synthesis cts technologies  both of which are related to the physical design of integrated circuits 
for purposes of valuing the iprd in accordance with the methodology discussed above  the following estimates were used revenue growth ranging from in year two to in year five  cost of sales of revenue in each year  general and administrative expenses of revenue in each year  and sales and marketing of revenue in each year 
in addition  it was assumed there would be no expense reduction due to economic synergies as a result of the acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from the gambit purchased in process technology was 
the technologies were approximately complete at the acquisition date 
the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related  in varying degrees  to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications  including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the acquired in process technologies were originally anticipated to become commercially viable in fiscal and expenditures to complete the acquired in process technologies were expected to total approximately million 
subsequent to the date of the acquisition  we determined that the in process technologies acquired would be more commercially viable if they were integrated with our existing products and technologies in development 
our decision to integrate the acquired in process technologies rather than selling them as stand alone products is the result of changes in technology in the industry  development of our strategy for entering the market for physical design software  and market forces 
we have incurred research and development expenses of approximately million directly related to the acquired and enhanced technologies 
we introduced routing and cts products integrating the acquired in process technology to a limited number of customers in fiscal and expect general release of these products in fiscal the anticipated incremental revenue contribution from the enhanced technology and the related costs including cost of sales and incremental general and administrative and sales and marketing costs  are being evaluated based on current customer analysis  however  we expect the revenue and the costs related to this product to be consistent with the valuation assumptions noted above 
the risks associated with this research and development are still considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will meet market expectations 
if these projects are not successfully developed  future revenue  and profitability of the acquired gambit business may be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
as evidenced by its continued support for these projects  management believes that we will successfully complete each of the major gambit research and development programs 
we obtained a second in process routing technology from gambit  this technology has not been further developed except to the extent necessary to service former gambit customers using prior versions of the technology 
the post acquisition research and development costs have not been materially in excess of those anticipated at the acquisition date 
during fiscal and  we made other acquisitions resulting in aggregate iprd charges of million and million  respectively  none of which were individually material to the results of our operations in the respective year 
the fair value of the related iprd was determined in a manner substantially similar to that described for gambit 
the risks associated with this acquired research and development are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit to us or meet market expectations 
other income  net 
other income  net was million  million and million  or  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase for fiscal is due in part to an increase in realized gains on investments  which were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  in part to the receipt of rental income of million in fiscal  as compared to zero for fiscal and in part to the gain of million on the sale of our silicon libraries business to artisan 
these gains were partially offset by the write down of certain assets in our venture portfolio in the amount of million for fiscal and a lower level of interest income in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income primarily reflects our lower average cash balances  which resulted from the continuation of our stock repurchase programs and the decision to grant extended payment terms on more revenue contracts in fiscal other income  net increased from fiscal to fiscal from a higher mix of higher yield taxable to tax exempt investments in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  other income  net increased in comparison to fiscal due to gains realized on sales of equity investments 
for fiscal  we expect other income and expense to be between million and million  including approximately million from the sale of investments held by the company 
during the year ended october   we determined that certain of the assets held in our venture fund  with an aggregate value of million  were impaired  and that the impairment was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately million to write down the carrying value of the investments 
the impairment charge is included in other income  net 
the impairment charge relates to certain investments in non public companies and represents management s estimate of the impairment incurred during the period as a result of specific analysis of each investment  considering the activities of and events occurring at each of the underlying portfolio companies during the quarter 
our portfolio companies operate in industries that are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
for equity investments in non public companies for which there is not a market in which their value is readily determinable  we review each investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis based  primarily on achievement of business plan objectives and current market conditions  among other factors 
the primary business plan objectives we consider include  among others  those related to financial performance such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature such as the introduction of technology or the hiring of key employees on a timely basis 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred with respect to an investment in a portfolio company  in the absence of quantitative valuation metrics  management estimates the impairment and or the net realizable value of the portfolio investment based on public and private company market comparable information and valuations completed for companies similar to our portfolio companies 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes with respect to our cash and short term investments 
we place our investments in a mix of tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we do not anticipate any material losses due to this risk with respect to our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average after tax interest return for our investment portfolio at october  the carrying value approximates fair value at that date 
in accordance with our investment policy  the weighted average duration of the company s investment portfolio does not exceed one year 
principal notional amounts in us dollars weighted carrying average after amount tax return in thousands short term investments fixed rate  money market funds variable rate  total interest bearing instruments  see note  financial instruments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on investment maturity dates  long term debt and equity price risk related to the company s long term investments 
foreign currency risk 
at the present time  we do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows but hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
hedging activities undertaken are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on these balances 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of balances denominated in various currencies and foreign currency fluctuations 
at october   we have forward contracts for the sale and purchase of foreign currencies with a notional value expressed in us dollars of million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
there can be no assurance that these hedging transactions will be effective in the future 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at october  due to the short term nature of these contracts  the amount in us dollars approximates the fair value of the contract at october  these forward contracts mature in approximately thirty days

derivative financial instruments 
on november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument  depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged  changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged anticipated transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately 
upon adoption of sfas  the cumulative transition adjustment was insignificant 
we do not believe that ongoing application of sfas will significantly alter our hedging strategies 
however  its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income 
apart from our foreign currency hedging and forward sales of certain equity investments  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
in particular  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
european monetary union 
in january  a new currency called the european monetary unit  or euro  was introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
we have assessed the impact the euro formation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
our international sales are based primarily in us dollars which is not subject to the euro conversion 
while we do have some sales and operating expenses denominated in the european currency unit  this currency is successfully being converted in the market to the new euro at parity 
in addition  we upgraded our internal computer systems to convert the european currencies to the euro 
we expect no material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations due to the conversion to the euro 
proposed acquisition of ikos systems  inc 
on july   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the merger agreement with ikos systems  inc ikos 
the merger agreement provides for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of ikos common stock by synopsys 
the merger is expected to be completed in august  however  under certain circumstances the merger may close prior to june  we will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting 
upon completion of the merger  holders of ikos common stock will be entitled to receive synopsys common stock with a value between and in exchange for each share of ikos common stock owned at the time of completion of the merger 
the exact amount per share will depend upon the financial performance of ikos during the month measurement period ending june  and will be calculated based on formulas contained in the merger agreement 
the formulas contained in the merger agreement provide for proportionate increases in the purchase price per ikos share as ikos revenue  revenue plus change in backlog or profit loss before tax pbt each as defined in the merger agreement increase 
if the merger closes before june   the merger agreement provides for holders of ikos common stock on the closing date to receive synopsys common stock with a value of for each share of ikos common stock  regardless of ikos financial performance up to the date of closing 
regardless of when the merger closes  the purchase price per ikos share is subject to reduction if the number of outstanding ikos shares and options immediately before the effective time of the merger exceeds an agreed upon level 
however  the purchase price per ikos share will not be less than the merger is subject to certain conditions  including ikos achieving revenue of at least million and losses before tax not exceeding million during the twelve month period ending june   expiration or termination of a synopsys emulation non compete agreement  ikos stockholder approval  retention of certain employees  compliance with regulatory requirements and customary closing conditions 
the actual number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in the merger and the aggregate purchase price at the effective time of the merger cannot be determined until ikos financial performance during the measurement period is calculated and until the average last sale price of synopsys common stock during the applicable pre closing pricing period is determined 
on december   mentor graphics corporation commenced a tender offer for all shares of ikos common stock 
the offer is subject to numerous conditions  including the termination of the merger agreement 
the purported terms and conditions of the offer are set forth in an offer to purchase filed by mentor as part of a schedule to with the securities and exchange commission on december  and in certain amendments thereto filed by mentor with the sec thereafter 
ikos response to the tender offer is set forth in a schedule d filed by ikos with the securities and exchange commission on december  and in certain amendments thereto filed by ikos with the sec thereafter 
litigation relating to ikos is discussed above under item subsequent event proposed acquisition of avant corporation on december   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with avant corporation avant by which avant will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of synopsys 
we will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting 
upon completion of the merger  holders of avant common stock will be entitled to receive of a share of synopsys common stock including the associated preferred stock rights in exchange for each share of avant common stock the exchange ratio owned at the time of completion of the merger 
the exchange ratio will be proportionately adjusted for any stock split  stock dividend  reorganization or similar change in avant common stock or synopsys common stock 
avant stockholders will receive cash based on the market price of synopsys common stock in lieu of any fractional shares to which they might otherwise be entitled 
the merger is subject to certain conditions  including approval by the avant stockholders of the merger and the agreement and plan of merger  approval by synopsys stockholders of the issuance of synopsys common stock in the merger  compliance with regulatory requirements and customary closing conditions 
the actual number of shares of synopsys common stock to be issued in the proposed merger and the dollar value at the effective time of the merger cannot be determined until the closing date of the merger 
effect of new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas we adopted the provisions of sfas effective july  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas is adopted will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized and tested for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance until the date of adoption of sfas upon adoption of sfas  we will evaluate existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
in addition  we will be required to test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the six month period following adoption 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
any subsequent impairment losses will be included in operating activities 
we expect to adopt sfas on november  as of october   unamortized goodwill is million  which will no long be amortized subsequent to the adoption of sfas related goodwill amortization expense for fiscal  and is million  million and million  respectively 
amortization expense for the one month transition period ended october  was million 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at october   an increase of million  or  from october  cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million provided by investing activities during fiscal the increase in cash provided by investing activities of million is due primarily to net proceeds from the sale of short and long term investments totaling million for fiscal as compared to net proceeds of investments totaling million for fiscal the cash received from the sales of investments during fiscal was primarily used to purchase treasury stock 
capital expenditures totaled million during fiscal as we continue to invest in fixed assets  primarily related to construction of our oregon facilities and computing equipment to upgrade our internal engineering and enterprise application systems 
we used million in net cash for financing activities during compared to in fiscal the primary financing uses of cash during were the repurchase of million shares of common stock for approximately per share and payments on debt obligations totaling million 
financing proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee stock plans during fiscal were million compared to million during fiscal accounts receivable remained relatively flat from million at october  to million at october  days sales outstanding  which is calculated based on revenues for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet decreased to days as of october  from days at october  the decrease in days sales outstanding is the result of the change in our license model resulting in scheduled billings over the life of the contract for tsls whereas  under the prior form of time based licenses the contract amount was typically billed up front 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results weakness in the semiconductor and electronics businesses may negatively impact synopsys business 
synopsys business depends on the semiconductor and electronics businesses  which in experienced their sharpest decline in orders and revenue in over years 
purchases of our products are largely dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers  the number of design engineers and the increasing complexity of designs 
during many semi conductor and electronic companies cancelled or deferred design projects and reduced their design engineering staffs  which respectively impacted our orders and revenues and particularly our professional services business 
demand for our products and services may also be affected by mergers in the semiconductor and systems industries  which may reduce the aggregate level of purchases of our products and services by the combined company 
continuation or worsening of the current conditions in the semiconductor industry  and continued consolidation among our customers  all could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
synopsys revenue and earnings may fluctuate 
many factors affect our revenue and earnings  which makes it difficult to achieve predictable revenue and earnings growth 
among these factors are customer product and service demand  product license terms  and the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold 
the following specific factors could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several quarterly or annual periods our products are complex  and before buying them customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing them 
our customers evaluation and purchase cycles do not necessarily match our quarterly periods 
in the past  we have received a disproportionate volume of orders in the last week of a quarter 
in addition  a large proportion of our business is attributable to our largest customers 
as a result  if any order  and especially a large order  is delayed beyond the end of a fiscal period  our orders for that period could be below our plan and our revenue could be below any targets we may have published 
accounting rules determine when revenue is recognized on our orders  and therefore impact how much revenue we will report in any given fiscal period 
the authoritative literature under which synopsys recognizes revenue has been  and is expected to continue to be  the subject of much interpretative guidance 
in general  after the adoption of tsls in the fourth quarter of fiscal  most orders for our products and services yield revenue over multiple quarters or years or upon completion of performance rather than at the time the product is shipped 
for any given order  however  the specific terms agreed to with a customer may have the effect of requiring deferral or acceleration of revenue in whole or in part 
therefore  for any given fiscal period it is possible for us to fall short in our revenue and or earnings plan even while orders and backlog remain on plan or  conversely  to meet or exceed our revenue and or earnings plan because of backlog and deferred revenue and the mix of orders during authorization period  while aggregate orders are under plan 
our revenue and earnings targets are based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a license mix of perpetual licenses on which revenue is generally recognized in the quarter shipped and tsls on which revenue is recognized over the term of license that includes to perpetual licenses 
if we are unable to achieve a mix in this range our ability to achieve short term or long term revenue and or earnings targets may be impaired 
synopsys may not be able to successfully compete in the eda industry 
the eda industry is highly competitive 
we compete against other eda vendors  and with customers internally developed design tools and internal design capabilities for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential customers 
in general  competition is based on product quality and features  post sale support  price and  as discussed below  the ability to offer a complete design flow 
our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services  such as cadence design systems  inc  avant and mentor graphics corporation  as well as companies  including numerous recently public and start up companies  that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the integrated circuit design process 
in certain situations  synopsys competitors have been offering aggressive discounts on certain of their products  in particular simulation and synthesis products 
as a result  average prices for these products may fall 
technology advances and customer requirements continue to fuel a change in the nature of competition among eda vendors  which could hurt synopsys ability to compete 
increasingly  eda companies compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design products referred to as physical synthesis products rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design process 
the need to offer physical synthesis products will become increasingly important as ics grow more complex 
our physical synthesis products compete principally with products from cadence and magma design automation  both of which include more complete physical design capabilities 
we are working on completing our design flow 
in june we announced two physical design products  and in december we announced the avant merger 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to offer a competitive complete design flow to customers as a result of these efforts or the proposed avant merger 
if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete design flow on a timely basis  if the avant merger is not completed or if we are unsuccessful in convincing customers to adopt our integrated design flow  our competitive position could be significantly weakened 
synopsys revenue growth depends on new and non synthesis products  which may not be accepted in the marketplace 
historically  much of our growth has been attributable to the strength of our logic synthesis products 
our dc family of products accounted for of revenue in fiscal we believe that orders and revenue for our flagship logic synthesis product  design compiler  and the dc family have peaked 
over the long term  we expect the contribution from the dc family to decline as our customers transition from dc family products to physical synthesis products 
in order to meet our revenue plan  aggregate revenues products other than the dc family and from professional services must grow faster than our overall revenue growth target 
if such revenue growth fails to meet our goals  it will be difficult for us to meet our overall revenue or earnings targets 
in order to sustain revenue growth over the long term  we will have to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that are accepted by a broad range of customers and to continue the growth in our consulting services business 
product success is difficult to predict 
the introduction of new products and growth of a market for such products cannot be assured 
in the past we  like all companies  have introduced new products that have failed to meet our revenue expectations 
expanding revenue from consulting services may be difficult in the current economic environment 
it will require us to continue to develop effective management controls on bidding and executing on consulting engagements 
increasing consulting orders and revenue while maintaining an adequate level of profit can be difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding revenue from existing or new products at the desired rate or in expanding our services business  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
businesses that synopsys has acquired or that synopsys may acquire in the future  including ikos and avant  may not perform as projected 
we have acquired or merged with a number of companies in recent years  and as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product and services offerings we may acquire additional companies 
for example  in july  synopsys announced the ikos merger and in december  synopsys announced the avant merger 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including potential dilution of earnings per share  problems in integrating the acquired products and employees into our business  the failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  the failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  the drain on management time for acquisition related activities  adverse effects on customer buying patterns and assumption of unknown liabilities 
while we attempt to review proposed acquisitions carefully and negotiate terms that are favorable to us  there is no assurance that any acquisition will have a positive effect on our performance 
stagnation of international economies would adversely affect our performance 
during fiscal  of our revenue was derived from outside north america  as compared to during fiscal international sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic or political conditions and to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
economic conditions in europe  japan and the rest of asia have deteriorated in recent quarters  and the longer this weakness persists the more likely it is to have a negative impact on our business 
in particular  a number of our largest european customers are in the telecommunications equipment business  which has weakened considerably this year 
the japanese economy has been stagnant for several years  and may now be entering a recession 
if the japanese economy remains weak  revenue and orders from japan  and perhaps the rest of asia  could be adversely affected 
in addition  the yen dollar and euro dollar exchange rates remain subject to unpredictable fluctuations 
weakness of the yen could adversely affect revenue and orders from japan during future quarters 
asian countries other than japan also have experienced economic and currency problems in recent years  and in most cases they have not fully recovered 
if such conditions persist or worsen  orders and revenues from the asia pacific region would be adversely affected 
synopsys success depends on recruiting and retaining key employees 
our success is dependent on technical and other contributions of key employees 
we participate in a dynamic industry  and our headquarters is in silicon valley  where  despite recent economic conditions  skilled technical  sales and management employees are in high demand 
there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers  and the competition for such individuals is intense 
despite economic conditions  start up activity in eda remains significant  and a number of eda companies have gone public in the past year 
experience at synopsys is highly valued in the eda industry and the general electronics industry  and our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and by start up companies in many industries 
in the past  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  significant employee turnover 
there can be no assurance that we can continue to recruit and retain the technical and managerial personnel we need to run our business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
synopsys is dependent on its proprietary technology 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely on agreements with customers  employees and others  and intellectual property laws  to protect our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
moreover  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
failure to obtain or maintain appropriate patent  copyright or trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us and any such claims could require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly and time consuming litigation or could subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products or could require us to redesign products 
our operating expenses do not fluctuate proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future revenue  and expense levels are generally committed in advance of revenue 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue  a shortfall in revenue translates directly into a reduction in net income 
for the first quarter of fiscal  our target for total expenses is to million 
if we are unsuccessful in generating anticipated revenue or maintaining expenses within this range  however  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
synopsys has adopted anti takeover provisions  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or management 
we have adopted a number of provisions that could have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has adopted a preferred shares rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by its stockholders  to issue additional shares of common stock and to fix the rights and preferences of  and to issue authorized but undesignated shares of preferred stock 
these and other provisions of synopsys restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of synopsys  including transactions in which the stockholders of synopsys might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
synopsys is subject to changes in financial accounting standards  which may affect our reported revenue  or the way we conduct business 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  the sec and various bodies appointed by these organizations to interpret existing rules and create new accounting policies 
in particular  a task force of the accounting standards executive committee  a subgroup of the aicpa  meets on a quarterly basis to review various issues arising under the existing software revenue recognition rules  and interpretations of these rules 
additional interpretations issued by the task force may have an adverse effect on how we report revenue or on the way we conduct our business in the future 
synopsys is subject to a number of special risks as a result of its planned acquisition of avant as a result of entering into an agreement to acquire avant  synopsys is subject to additional risks and uncertainties  including the following synopsys may fail to integrate successfully synopsys and avant s operations 
as a result  synopsys and avant may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the avant merger 
synopsys and avant expect that the avant merger will result in benefits to synopsys and avant  including the offering of a complete and  over time  integrated set of software products for the design and verification of complex integrated circuits to its customers 
however  the expected benefits may not be fully realized 
achieving the benefits of the avant merger will depend on many factors  including the successful and timely integration of the products  technology and sales operations of the two companies following the completion of the avant merger 
these integration efforts may be difficult and time consuming  especially considering the highly technical and complex nature of each company s products 
failure to achieve a successful and timely integration of their respective products and sales operations could result in the loss of existing or potential customers of synopsys and avant and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of synopsys and its subsidiaries  including avant  and on the price of synopsys common shares 
integration efforts between the two companies will also divert significant management attention and resources 
this diversion of attention and resources could have an adverse effect on synopsys during such transition period 
avant has been required to pay substantial amounts in the recent resolution of criminal and civil litigation  and might be required to pay substantial additional amounts under pending lawsuits 
during  avant paid approximately million in fines and restitution arising out of charges brought by the district attorney of santa clara county the santa clara criminal action 
avant does not expect any further proceedings in the santa clara criminal action and  therefore  does not expect to incur any additional litigation costs  fines or other payments in such criminal action 
avant and its subsidiaries are engaged in a number of material civil litigation matters  including an action brought by cadence design systems  inc in december avant cadence litigation 
the avant cadence litigation generally arises out of the same set of facts that were the subject of the santa clara criminal action 
avant believes it has defenses to all of cadence s claims and intends to defend itself vigorously 
should cadence ultimately succeed in the prosecution of its claims  however  avant could be required to pay substantial monetary damages to cadence 
some or all of these damages may be offset by the amounts paid to cadence as restitution in the santa clara criminal action 
injunctions entered in and enjoined avant from marketing its early place and route products  arccell and aquarius  based on a judicial determination that they incorporated portions of cadence s design framework ii source code dfii 
the injunctions also prohibit avant from possessing  using  selling or licensing any product or work copied or derived from dfii and directly or indirectly marketing  selling  leasing  licensing  copying or transferring any of the arccell or aquarius products 
the dfii code is not incorporated in any current avant product 
although cadence has not made a claim in the avant cadence litigation against any current avant product  including its apollo and astro place and route products  and has not introduced any evidence that any such product infringes cadence s intellectual property rights  avant expects cadence to assert such claims 
avant believes it would have defenses to any such claims and avant would defend itself vigorously 
nonetheless  should cadence be successful at proving that any past or then current avant product incorporated intellectual property misappropriated from cadence  avant could be permanently enjoined from further use of such intellectual property  which might require modification to existing products and or suspension of the sale of such products until such cadence intellectual property was removed 
the avant cadence litigation  other pending avant litigation and other potential litigation  regardless of the outcome  may continue to result in substantial costs and expenses and significant diversion of effort by management  and may negatively impact relationships with customers 
an adverse result in any of these litigation matters could seriously harm avant s and  after the proposed avant merger  synopsys business  financial condition and results of operations 
the insurer under the litigation protection insurance relating to the avant cadence litigation may be prevented from paying for certain losses on the grounds that such payment violates public policy 
synopsys has agreed to enter into a policy with an insurance company rated aaa by standard poors 
under the policy  insurance will be provided to pay synopsys an amount equaling certain compensatory  exemplary and punitive damages  penalties and fines  and attorneys fees arising out of the avant cadence litigation covered loss 
the policy does not provide coverage for litigation other than the avant cadence litigation 
in exchange for a binding fee of million paid by synopsys  the insurer has issued a legally binding commitment to provide the coverage  effective following the closing of the avant merger 
such fee is refundable in part to synopsys in the event the avant merger is not completed 
otherwise  the fee will be credited against the premium to make the insurance effective  which must be paid by synopsys to the insurer on or about the closing of the avant merger 
in return for a premium of million  including the binding fee  the insurer will be obligated to pay covered loss up to a limit of liability equaling a million plus b interest accruing at the fixed rate of  compounded semi annually  on million 
the policy will expire upon a final judgment or settlement of the avant cadence litigation or any earlier date upon synopsys election 
upon such expiration  synopsys will be entitled to a payment equal to million plus interest calculated as set forth above less any loss paid under the policy 
certain of the potential losses relating to the avant cadence litigation that are covered by the terms of the litigation protection insurance obtained by synopsys with respect to that litigation may arise from exemplary and punitive damages  fines and penalties 
in some jurisdictions  it may be against public policy to provide insurance for willful acts  punitive damages or similar claims 
this could potentially affect the validity of certain elements of the policy 
the legal agreement governing the arrangement will be governed by the laws of the state of delaware 
synopsys believes that the arrangement will be enforceable in delaware  but there can be no assurance in this regard 
to the extent the insurer is prevented from paying certain losses on grounds of public policy that would otherwise be covered by the insurance  coverage will be unavailable for that portion of the losses and the insurer may be obligated to refund a portion of the premium to synopsys 
whether or not the avant merger is completed  the announcement of the proposed avant merger may cause disruptions in the business of synopsys  which could have material adverse effects on the business and operations of synopsys 
whether or not the proposed avant merger is completed  synopsys customers  in response to the announcement of the proposed avant merger  may delay or defer decisions  which could have a material adverse effect on the business of synopsys 
similarly  current and prospective synopsys employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with synopsys 
this may adversely affect synopsys ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
the extent of this adverse effect could depend on the length of time prior to completion of the proposed avant merger or termination of the merger agreement between synopsys and avant 
failure to complete the avant merger could negatively impact synopsys stock price  future business and operations 
if the avant merger is not completed for any reason  synopsys may be subject to a number of material risks  including the following synopsys may face difficulties in attracting strategic customers and partners who were expecting to use the integrated product suite proposed to be offered by the merged company  to assist in the development of new products by the separate companies  and certain costs relating to the proposed avant merger  such as legal  accounting  financial advisor and printing fees  must be paid even if the proposed avant merger is not completed 
following the merger  synopsys will not have control over the avant cadence litigation or the authority to settle the avant cadence litigation except in limited circumstances 
under the terms of the litigation protection insurance obtained by synopsys with respect to the avant cadence litigation described above  which will become effective immediately following the merger  the insurer has the right to exercise full control over the defense of the avant cadence litigation  including both the strategy and tactics to be employed 
further  the insurer has the right to exclusively control the negotiation  discussion and terms of any proposed settlement  except that synopsys retains the right to settle the avant cadence litigation  with the consent of the insurer  for up to million plus accruing interest less certain costs 
therefore  following the merger  synopsys will have a severely limited ability to control any risks associated with  and the timing related to  any liabilities resulting from the avant cadence litigation
