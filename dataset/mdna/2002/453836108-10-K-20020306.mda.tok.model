generally  the actual maturity of loans is substantially less than their contractual maturity due to prepayments and  in the case of real estate loans  due on sale clauses  which generally gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of real estate loans tends to increase when current real estate loan rates are higher than rates on mortgages in the portfolio and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on mortgages in the portfolio are higher than current real estate loan rates 
under the latter scenario  the weighted average yield on the portfolio tends to decrease as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
due to the fact that the bank may  consistent with industry practice  roll over a significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing the loans on substantially similar or revised terms  the principal repayments actually received by the bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period

combined increases in the amount of allocated reserves in these three portfolio components represented approximately of the total increase in allocated reserves from december  the increase in the reserve allocated to the real estate construction portfolio component is attributed largely to the re categorization of five specific loans related to four construction projects undertaken by four different obligors 
all of these obligations were performing at december  the increase in the reserve allocated to the real estate residential portfolio component is a direct result of growth in the residential mortgage and home equity subsets of this component of the loan portfolio 
outstanding balances at december  in each of these subcategories grew by and  respectively  and by combined as a whole  from december  the increase in the reserve allocated to the consumer installment portfolio component is the result of changes in the analytical method and subjective assumptions used to determine the amount of required reserve allocation 
this new approach  which is described below  has been implemented as a refinement to prior practices 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the reserve for loan losses for the years indicated reserve amount credit quality discount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated reserves commercial industrial  real estate commercial  real estate construction  real estate residential consumer installment  consumer other imprecision reserve  na total reserve for loan losses  reserve amount credit quality discount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated reserves commercial industrial  real estate commercial   real estate construction real estate residential consumer installment  consumer other imprecision reserve  na total reserve for loan losses   reserve amount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated reserves commercial industrial  real estate commercial  real estate construction real estate residential consumer installment  consumer other imprecision reserve  na total reserve for loan losses  reserve amount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated reserves commercial industrial  real estate commercial  real estate construction real estate residential consumer installment  consumer other imprecision reserve  na total reserve for loan losses  reserve amount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated reserves commercial industrial  real estate commercial  real estate construction real estate residential consumer installment  consumer other imprecision reserve  na total reserve for loan losses  allocated reserves for loan losses are determined using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment 
the formula based approach evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment 
individual loans within the commercial industrial  real estate commercial and real estate construction loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar credit risk characteristics 
the level of reserve allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience  and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
a similar formula based approach  using a point in time credit grade distribution  was recently developed for the consumer installment segment of the loan portfolio and employed for the first time in this new method was developed in response to the significance of the balance of this segment of the portfolio and the seasoning of this segment of the portfolio has allowed for a more analytical overview of its inherent risk characteristics 
this new method has been combined with subjective factors  which reflect changing environmental conditions in the consumer installment loan market 
the result of this analytical approach was an increase in the reserve allocation for installment loans to million at december   compared with million at december  allocations for residential real estate and other consumer loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses in those categories 
in each segment  inherent losses are estimated  based on a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past loan loss experience  and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
the other method used to allocate the reserve for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the bank will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method loans are selected for evaluation based on a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or non accrual status 
a specific reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of fair value of collateral  present value of anticipated future cash flows or the loans observable fair market price 
loans with a specific reserve and the amount of such reserve totaled  and  at december   respectively 
a portion of the reserve for loan loss is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this non specific reserve is maintained for two primary reasons there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the bank s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations  or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the bank may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the bank s analysis of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains a non specific reserve for loan losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  management increased the measurement imprecision allocation approximately million to million at december  primarily based upon concerns over how the overall weakening of the national economy may affect borrowers in its loan portfolio 
as drew to a close  empirical evidence indicated that the nation had entered into a recession 
through december   however  the national economic slowdown had not yet had a significant effect on the overall credit quality or incidence of default within the bank s loan portfolio 
management  nonetheless  increased the measurement imprecision allocation of the loan loss reserve by million  as of december   based upon its belief that some of the bank s customer base may lag behind larger national firms with respect to the effects of a recession 
as of december   the reserve for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the reserve for loan losses at december  is adequate 
the credit quality discount was million and million for the year end december  and  respectively 
non interest income the following table sets forth information regarding non interest income for the periods shown 
non interest income years ended december  in thousands service charges on deposit accounts    investment management services income    mortgage banking income    bank owned life insurance    securities gains  other non interest income    total    non interest income  which is generated by deposit account service charges  investment management services  mortgage banking activities  and miscellaneous other sources  amounted to million in service charges on deposit accounts  which represented of total non interest income in  increased from million in to million in investment management revenue decreased by to million compared to million in this decrease is a result of the sharp downturn in the equities market  which reduced the fair value of assets under management in mortgage banking income  million in  increased over income of million 
this increase is due to a declining interest rate environment  which stimulated refinancing activity 
the bank s mortgage banking revenue consists primarily of application fees and origination fees on sold loans  net servicing income  and gains and losses on the sale of loans 
residential mortgage loans are originated as necessary to meet consumer demand 
sales of such loans in the secondary market occur to lend balance to the bank s interest rate sensitivity 
such sales generate gains or losses at the time of sale  produce future servicing income  and provide funds for additional lending and other purposes 
typically  loans are sold with the bank retaining responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments  inspecting properties  making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers  and otherwise servicing the loans and receiving a fee for performing these services 
non interest expense the following table sets forth information regarding non interest expense for the periods shown 
non interest expense years ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expenses    equipment expenses    data processing and facilities management    intangible asset amortization   advertising    consulting fees  legal fees loan collection legal fees other fdic assessment office supplies and printing postage expense  telephone expense   special charges  other non interest expenses    total    non interest expense  excluding special charges in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof  increased by million or for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or  attributable to the addition of approximately employees staffing the acquired branches  additions to staff needed to support continued growth including the introduction of a call center and internet banking  employees merit increases  performance based incentive compensation and increases in medical insurance premiums 
occupancy and equipment related expenses increased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of the acquired branches as well as the opening of a de novo branch in falmouth and a new technology center in plymouth  all in the latter part of amortization of intangible assets increased million  or  for the year ended december   reflecting one full year with the acquired branches 
the remaining non interest expenses increased by million  or 
this was mainly due to increases associated with the branch acquisition  including telephone  postage  software maintenance  and armored car expense 
also  consulting fees increased  primarily due to the refinement of our branch staffing model 
minority interest in  independent capital trust i trust i was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
a total of million of trust preferred securities were issued by trust i 
in  independent capital trust ii trust ii was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
a total of million of trust preferred securities were issued by trust ii as capital support for the fleetboston acquisition 
on december  independent capital trust iii trust iii was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
a total of million of trust preferred securities were issued by trust iii  the net proceeds of which were used to redeem the trust ii securities on january  the company recorded distributions payable on the trust preferred securities as minority interest expense totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes for the years ended december   and the company recorded combined federal and state income tax provisions of million  million and million respectively 
these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of  and  in   and  respectively  which are less than the company s combined statutory tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax rates are attributable to certain non taxable interest and dividends and certain tax efficiency strategies employed by the company 
the tax effects of all income and expense transactions are recognized by the company in each year s consolidated statements of income regardless of the year in which the transactions are reported for income tax purposes 
asset liability management the bank s asset liability management process monitors and manages  among other things  the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  the composition of the securities portfolio  funding needs and sources  and the liquidity position 
all of these factors  as well as projected asset growth  current and potential pricing actions  competitive influences  national monetary and fiscal policy  and the regional economic environment are considered in the asset liability management process 
the asset liability management committee  whose members comprise the bank s senior management  develops procedures  consistent with policies established by the board of directors  which monitor and coordinate the bank s interest rate sensitivity and the sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and its effect on earnings 
if assets and liabilities do not re price simultaneously and in equal volume  the potential for interest rate exposure exists 
it is management s objective to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income through the maintenance of an appropriate mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and  when necessary  within prudent limits  through the use of off balance sheet hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps 
the committee employs simulation analyses in an attempt to quantify  evaluate  and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income 
in addition  the bank engages an independent consultant to render advice with respect to asset and liability management strategy 
the bank is careful to increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of those funds 
accordingly  management has implemented funding strategies that include fhlb advances and repurchase agreement lines 
these non deposit funds are also viewed as a contingent source of liquidity and  when profitable lending and investment opportunities exist  access to such funds provides a means to leverage the balance sheet 
at december   approximately of the company s total assets consisted of assets  which will re price or mature within one year 
as of that date  the amount of the company s cumulative hedged gap was a negative million  or of total assets 
the following table sets forth the company s cumulative hedged gap as of december  amounts maturing or repricing within three months over three to twelve months over one year through five years over five years through ten years over ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold   securities      loans fixed rate     loans floating rate    total interest earning assets    bank owned life insurance   interest bearing liabilities savings and interest checking accounts money market and super interest checking accounts  time deposits     borrowings     total interest bearing liabilities    corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation    net interest sensitivity unhedged gap during the period  cumulative gap      effect of hedging activities   cumulative hedged gap     adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate loans are included in periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
balances have been reduced for non performing loans which amounted to million at the same date 
although the bank s regular savings accounts generally are subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers most of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based on the bank s experience of retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
from time to time  the bank has utilized interest rate swap agreements as hedging instruments against stable or declining interest rates 
an interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a fixed rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period of time from a second party 
the assets relating to the notional principal amount are not actually exchanged 
the bank had entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million at december  and million at december  these swaps were arranged through large international financial institutions and have initial maturities ranging from two months to five years 
the bank receives fixed rate payments and pays a variable rate of interest tied to either month libor or prime 
at december   the weighted average fixed payment rate received was and the weighted average rate of the variable interest payments made by the bank was 
as a result of these interest rate swaps  the bank realized net interest income of approximately million in and million in in january  the bank sold a million notional value interest rate swap with a fair value of  the gain will be realized in earnings on a straight line basis over the original remaining life of the swap agreement approximately years 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board and narrower guidelines approved by the asset liability management committee 
these limits and guidelines reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying and hedging them 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions under various scenarios 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift up or down basis points estimated net interest income for the next months should decline by less than 
the following table reflects the company s estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next months rate change basis points estimated exposure as of net interest income liquidity liquidity  as it pertains to the company  is the ability to generate cash in the most economical way for the institution to meet its ongoing obligations to pay deposit withdrawals and to fund loan commitments 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  and the amortization  prepayment  and maturities of loans and investments 
the bank utilizes its extensive branch network to access retail customers who provide a stable base of in market core deposits 
these funds are principally comprised of demand deposits  interest checking accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts 
deposit levels are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competitive factors 
the bank has also established five repurchase agreement lines  with major brokerage firms as potential sources of liquidity 
at december   the company had no advances outstanding under these lines 
in addition to these lines  the bank also had customer repurchase agreements outstanding amounting to million at december  as a member of the federal home loan bank  rockland has access to approximately million of borrowing capacity 
on december   the bank had million outstanding in fhlb borrowings 
the company  as a separately incorporated bank holding company  has no significant operations other than serving as the sole stockholder of the bank 
on an unconsolidated basis  the company s assets include its investment in the bank and million of goodwill 
in addition  the company issued million of junior subordinated debentures in conjunction with the issuance of trust preferred securities by direct subsidiaries  independent capital trust i  independent capital trust ii and independent capital trust iii 
the million of debentures issued in conjunction with independent capital trust ii were redeemed on january  the company has no employees and no significant liabilities or sources of income 
expenses incurred by the company relate to its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended and related expenses as a publicly traded company 
the company is directly reimbursed by the bank for virtually all such expenses 
the company actively manages its liquidity position under the direction of the asset liability management committee 
periodic review under prescribed policies and procedures is intended to ensure that the company will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
at december   the company s liquidity position was well above policy guidelines 
management believes that the bank has adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
capital resources the federal reserve board frb  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  and other regulatory agencies have established capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
risk based capital guidelines issued by the federal regulatory agencies require banks to meet a minimum tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the company and the bank substantially exceeded the minimum requirements for tier risk based and total risk based capital 
a minimum requirement of tier leverage capital is also mandated 
on december   the tier leverage capital ratio for the company and the bank was and  respectively 
capital ratios of the company and the bank are shown below for the last two year ends 
december  the company tier leverage capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio the bank tier leverage capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio dividends the company declared cash dividends of 
per share in and 
per share in the and ratio of dividends paid to earnings was and respectively 
since substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends are derived from the bank  future dividends will depend on the earnings of the bank  its financial condition  its need for funds  applicable governmental policies and regulations  and other such matters as the board of directors deems appropriate 
management believes that the bank will continue to generate adequate earnings to continue to pay dividends 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the financial nature of the company s consolidated financial statements is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
however  inflation does affect the company because  as prices increase  the money supply grows and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
the impact on the company is a noted increase in the size of loan requests with resulting growth in total assets 
in addition  operating expenses may increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation
