overview we provide integrated computer systems for in house and outsourced data processing to commercial banks with under billion in total assets  credit unions and other financial institutions 
we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market  together with compatible computer hardware  to financial institutions throughout the united states 
we also perform data conversion and software installation for the implementation of our systems and provide continuing customer maintenance and support services after the systems are installed 
for our customers who prefer not to make an up front investment in software and hardware  we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our eight data centers and fourteen item processing centers located across the united states 
we derive revenues from four primary sources sales of software licenses and installation services  support and service fees  hardware sales  and customer reimbursements 
over the last five fiscal years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income from continuing operations has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions  allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services and expand the number of customers who use our core software systems to approximately  as of june  since july  we have completed acquisitions 
ten of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
the remaining two acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests 
the comparisons set forth below reflect the fact that the consolidated financial statements include all acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests as if each had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period reported 
software sales and installation revenue includes the licensing of application software systems and the conversion and installation services contracted with us by the customer 
we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements which typically provide the customer with a non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location upon payment of the license fee 
generally  to of license fees are payable upon execution of the license agreement with additional payments due upon either delivery of the software or the installation of the last application module 
we recognize of software license revenue upon delivery of the software and documentation

support and services fees are generated from ongoing services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to modify and update the software and from providing outsourced data processing services 
revenues from software support are generated pursuant to annual agreements and are recognized ratably over the life of the agreements 
outsourcing services are performed through data centers

comparative financial information for each quarter for fiscal years and is presented at the end of item critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies as discussed below require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue from sales of hardware  software and services and from arrangements involving multiple elements of each of the above 
revenue for multiple element arrangements are recorded based on contractual amounts  which are determined based upon the price charged when sold separately 
revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sales of hardware and equipment are recorded when title and risk of loss transfers 
licensing revenues are recorded upon delivery and acceptance of the software 
service fees for training and installation are recognized as the services are provided 
support revenues are recorded evenly over the related contract period 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of our reserve is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period such determination was made 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and intangibles 
we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of its tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term  rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company s future consolidated operating results 
forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other portions of this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
actual results are subject to risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  which could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated 
the risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the matters detailed in risk factors in item of the company s form k annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission 
undue reliance should not be placed on the forward looking statements 
the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect the company include the financial health of the banking industry  our ability to continue or effectively manage our rapid growth  adapting our products and services to changes in technology  changes in our strategic relationships  price competition  loss of key employees  consolidation in the banking industry  increased government regulation  network or internet security problems  declining computer hardware prices  and operational problems in our outsourcing facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on investments in us government securities 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management 
we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments 
based on the controls in place  credit worthiness of the customer base and the relative size of these financial instruments  we believe the risk associated with these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
