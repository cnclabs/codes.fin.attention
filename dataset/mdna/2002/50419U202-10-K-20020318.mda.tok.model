overview nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the basis of presentation includes management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the combined companies and each of the separate companies  lq corporation and lq properties 
our management believes that the combined presentation is most informative to holders of our paired common stock 
general nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we are a leading limited service lodging company providing clean and comfortable rooms in convenient locations at affordable prices 
we are one of the largest owner operators of limited service hotels in the united states 
we owned and operated la quinta reg  inns and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  containing approximately  rooms in states as of december nbsp  we strive to design hotels that attract both business and leisure travelers seeking quality rooms that are generally comparable to those of mid price  full service hotels  but at lower average room rates 
we believe that by not providing full service  management intensive facilities and services  such as in house restaurants  cocktail lounges  or room service  that typically carry high fixed costs and low margins  we are able to deliver a product that satisfies our customers needs and price expectations  while also permitting us to concentrate on the variable cost structure and the high margin nature of our limited service product 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition to owning and operating our hotel properties  we began  in late  to license the use of our proprietary brand names  including la quinta reg  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  in return for royalty and other fees through license agreements with franchisees 
as of december nbsp   our franchisees operated eight la quinta inns reg  and three la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  representing approximately  rooms under our brands 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we owned or provided financing for geographically dispersed healthcare facilities operated by eight different third party operators 
consistent with our intention to focus on the lodging industry  the healthcare operations and assets in our portfolio have been decreasing as a result of continued success in selling these assets to other healthcare real estate investors or to the operators of the facilities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  over the last two years  we have undergone significant financial and strategic change 
in january nbsp  we began a strategy of selling non lodging real estate assets in order to focus on our lodging business 
as a result of that change in strategy  we replaced substantially all of our senior management with executives who have  on average  approximately nbsp  years of experience in lodging and lodging related industries 
over the last two years  we have improved the operations of our lodging assets  including the reduction of costs and the introduction of a franchising program 
during that period  we also have sold approximately nbsp  billion of our non lodging assets with proceeds from those sales applied to reduce indebtedness and strengthening our balance sheet 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on december nbsp   our stockholders approved certain proposals which permitted us to restructure the existing organization of our companies by merging a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of lq corporation  with and into lq properties  with lq properties surviving the merger and becoming a subsidiary controlled by lq corporation while continuing its status as a reit 
we believe the restructuring  which was proposed primarily to address the challenges imposed by federal tax legislation on our previous grandfathered paired share reit structure  will enable us to grow our lodging real estate portfolio  management operations and brand franchising program without the restrictions imposed by this federal tax legislation 
the la quinta companies  combined results of operations comparison of year ended december nbsp  to year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we earn revenue by  owning and operating la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  as well as licensing the use of our brand in return for license and other fees under our franchise program   leasing healthcare facilities under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  and  providing mortgage financing for eight healthcare facilities in which the interest is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain conditions 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net loss available to paired common stockholders decreased  to  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december nbsp   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted common share for the year ended december nbsp  combined results of segment operations nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our operations are managed as two major segments lodging and healthcare 
the following table summarizes the contribution by each operating segment for the years ended december nbsp  and we consider contributions from each operating segment to include revenue from each business  less both direct and other operating expenses and general and administrative expenses 
we allocate certain administrative  legal  accounting and tax expenses to the healthcare segment that benefit the healthcare segment or are related to public company expense in order to maintain a presentation that is consistent with historical segment information 
a portion of these allocated expenses will continue to be incurred by us once the disposition of healthcare assets is complete 
these allocations amounted to approximately  for the year ended december nbsp  certain income or expenses of a non recurring or unusual nature are not included in the operating segment contribution 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size combined contribution from operating segments for the year ended december nbsp  decreased by  or  to  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  the decline in the combined contribution is primarily the result of the sale of certain healthcare assets 
the combined contribution is comprised of revenues of  and  offset by operating expenses of  and  for the years ended december nbsp  and  respectively

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following table summarizes statistical lodging data for the years ended december nbsp  and nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  number of company owned hotels in operation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  franchise hotels open nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  number of hotels under construction or refurbishment nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  occupancy percentage nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  adr nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  revpar nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  available room nights nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  comparable hotels nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  occupancy percentage nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  adr nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  revpar nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  available room nights nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  represents average daily rate represents revenue per available room available room night count in thousands represents hotels open for more than one year nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  lodging revenues include revenues from room rentals and other revenue sources from company owned hotels 
these other revenue sources include charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
in addition  lodging revenues include franchise fees charged to franchisees for operating under the la quinta reg  brand and using our hotel designs  operating systems and procedures 
lodging revenues decreased  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  the decrease in lodging revenues was primarily due to a decrease in room revenues 
room revenue is dictated by demand  measured as occupancy percentage  pricing  measured as average daily rate or adr  and the level of available room inventory 
room revenues decreased during the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  due to several factors  including  decreases in demand resulting from a slowing national economy and from the impact of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september nbsp  additionally  business and leisure travel slowed considerably during the last half of as companies reduced corporate travel and leisure travelers cancelled or delayed trips 
this reduced demand was reflected in the decrease in our occupancy percentage by nbsp  percentage points to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp  we expect the reduction in business and leisure travel  and the resulting reduction in our occupancy percentage  to continue throughout the first half of  declines in the percentage of full rate customers and reductions in rates in response to decreased demand 
the effect of reduced demand on adr was partially offset by travelers who re examined their lodging needs and decided to stay at limited service hotels rather than at full service hotels 
additionally  some travelers chose to travel by car rather than by airplane which benefited our drive to markets 
our adr decreased or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp   sales of hotel properties during caused decreases in room revenues for the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  available room inventory decreased by  room nights due to the sale of six hotels in the impact on room revenues during the year ended december nbsp  due to hotels sold in was nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size revpar  which is the product of adr and occupancy percentage  decreased by  or  to for the year ended december nbsp  compared to for the year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size lodging operating expenses decreased by  or  to  during the year ended december nbsp  compared to  during the year ended december nbsp  lodging operating expenses include both direct and other operating costs as well as general and administrative costs related to the lodging segment 
the decrease in lodging operating expenses is directly attributable to the decrease in occupancy at our hotels and our continued focus on reduction of certain costs and improved cost control measures 
while certain costs and components of those costs are uncontrollable eg  energy rates or fixed  we will continue our focus on cost control into nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size direct operating costs include costs directly associated with the operation of our hotels such as direct labor  utilities and hotel supplies 
direct operating costs decreased by  or to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  this decrease was primarily due to the impact of cost control measures which resulted in a reduction in salaries expense  supplies expense and other hotel expense 
labor costs decreased by  or  for the year ended december nbsp  the reductions in direct operating expenses were partially offset by rising energy costs of  for the year ended december nbsp  system enhancements  increased collection efforts along with renegotiated credit card processing terms contributed to a decrease in bad debt expense and credit card processing costs of  for the year 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size other operating costs for the lodging segment included costs such as property taxes  insurance  and certain franchise related fees charged to inn operations 
other operating costs increased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  due to increases in insurance costs of approximately  and franchise related fees of approximately  we expect the events of september nbsp  th to further increase our cost of insurance and to negatively impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size lodging general and administrative costs decreased  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  lodging general and administrative expenses include  among other costs  information services  legal  human resources  finance and accounting costs  sales  marketing  reservations and operations 
this decrease was primarily related to savings in reservations overhead  reduction in the cost of human resources services and reductions of expenses resulting from realignment in operations departments 
the comparison to prior year amounts was also impacted by costs related to certain employment agreements entered into during the year ended december nbsp  the savings in lodging general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased information systems costs of  for the year ended december nbsp  our management will continue to allocate resources to information systems needs in and therefore we expect that information systems costs will continue to increase during certain administrative  legal  accounting and tax expenses are allocated to the healthcare segment that benefit the healthcare operations or are related to public company expense in order to maintain a presentation that is consistent with historical segment information 
a portion of these allocated expenses will continue to be incurred once the disposition of healthcare assets is complete 
these allocations amounted to  for the year ended december nbsp  healthcare contribution nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  healthcare contribution decreased by   to  during the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  the decrease in healthcare contribution was primarily the result of the sale of certain healthcare assets and repayment of healthcare mortgages occurring between the third quarter of fiscal year and the year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  healthcare contribution was comprised of revenues of  including rent income of  interest income from real estate mortgages of  and interest from investment of cash reserves of  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to revenues of  including rent income of  interest income from mortgage loans of  and interest from investment of cash reserves of  for the year ended december nbsp  healthcare segment operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to  for the year ended december nbsp  the decreases in healthcare revenues and operating expenses are primarily a result of the impact of asset sales and mortgage repayments during we expect healthcare revenues to continue to decline as we sell additional healthcare related assets 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  font size remaining net investment in the form of mortgages outstanding to operators of eight facilities was  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to a net remaining investment in the form of mortgages outstanding to operators of facilities of  for the year ended december nbsp  remaining net investment in the form of leases with operators of facilities was  for the year ended december nbsp  compared to a net remaining investment in the form of leases with operators of facilities of  for the year ended december nbsp  other contribution nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  telematrix  a provider of telephones  software and equipment for the lodging and telecommunications industry  contributed  during the year ended december nbsp  compared to a contribution of  during the year ended december nbsp  this contribution was comprised of revenues of  and expenses of  during the year ended december nbsp  compared to revenues of  and expenses of  during the year ended december nbsp  the increase in other revenues of  and other contributions of  during the year ended december nbsp  is due primarily to increased sales of telecommunications equipment to certain large telephone companies partially offset by a decline in sales to the lodging industry during operations of telematrix have been included in the lodging revenue and expense categories of the combined and consolidated statements since consummation of the acquisition in october nbsp  and are separately disclosed as other contribution in note nbsp  segment reporting of the combined and consolidated statements

consequently  the decrease in lodging revenues was primarily due to a decrease in room revenues 
room revenue is dictated by demand  measured as occupancy percentage  pricing  measured as average daily rate or adr  and the level of available room inventory 
room revenues decreased during the year ended december nbsp  compared to the year ended december nbsp  due to several factors  including  decreases in demand resulting from a slowing national economy and from the impact of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september nbsp  additionally  business and leisure travel slowed considerably during the last half of as companies reduced corporate travel and leisure travelers cancelled or delayed trips

the effect of reduced demand on adr was partially offset by travelers who re examined their lodging needs and decided to stay at limited service hotels rather than a full service hotels

the decrease was primarily related to savings in reservations overhead  reduction of human resources costs  reduction of expense resulting from realignment in operations departments  and the elimination of costs related to certain employment agreements entered into during the savings in lodging general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased information systems costs of  in management plans to continue allocation of resources to information systems needs in and therefore expects that information systems costs will continue to increase in certain administrative  legal  accounting and tax expenses are allocated to the healthcare segment that benefit the healthcare operations or are related to public company expense in order to maintain a presentation that is consistent with historical segment information

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as a result of the recent economic downturn and terrorist attacks which have had an adverse effect on the lodging business  there is a possibility that we will not meet one or more of these covenants beginning with the trailing four quarter period ending march nbsp   particularly the minimum lodging ebitda covenant  which increases from nbsp  million to nbsp  million 
we have had preliminary discussions with our lead banks regarding the possibility of amending the credit facility

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the above described factors including specifically those set forth in this joint annual report under the heading items and  description of our business and our properties  certain factors you should consider about our companies  our businesses and our securities will impact the amount of the consideration to be received in connection with the sale of any such assets  which will impact the amount of debt obligations that may be repaid in connection with such sales  the amount of capital available for redeployment in the lodging business  as well as the gain or loss that will be recognized by lq properties in connection with such sale 
further  to the extent lq properties enters into agreements to sell assets at sales prices less than the carrying value of such assets on lq properties balance sheet after giving effect to prior adjustments to such carrying value  lq properties will recognize losses related to such sales  some of which may be substantial as a result of the above described transactions  at the time that such agreements are entered into  rather than at the time such sales are actually consummated 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that our efforts to sell the remaining healthcare and select lodging assets and pay down additional debt or reinvest the proceeds in the lodging business will be successful 
effects of certain events on lodging demand nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the terrorist attacks on september nbsp  have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
the terrorist attacks  compounded with the slowing national economy  have resulted in substantially reduced demand for lodging for both business and leisure travelers across all lodging segments 
following the terrorist attacks  we experienced significant decreases in occupancy  compared to the comparable period last year 
although we continually and actively manage the operating costs of our hotels in order to respond to changes in the demand at our lodging properties  we must also continue to provide the level of service that our guests expect 
we cannot currently project the precise impact on us of the terrorist attacks and their aftermath  the future responses to these attacks or any other related hostilities or timing of any improvements in the general economy 
however  we currently do expect that diminished business and consumer confidence  and the attendant decrease in lodging demand from both the slow economy and terrorist attacks  will result in significant declines in revpar and ebitda through at least the first half of information regarding operators of healthcare assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   our healthcare portfolio comprised approximately of the net book value of our total real estate investments before impairments

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  lq properties monitors credit risk for its healthcare portfolio by evaluating a combination of publicly available financial information  information provided by the operators themselves and information otherwise available to lq properties 
the financial condition and ability of these healthcare operators to meet their rental and other obligations will  among other things  have an impact on lq properties revenues  net income loss  its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and its ability to meet debt obligations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  operators of assisted living facilities are experiencing longer fill up periods and are being impacted by concerns regarding the potential of over building  increased regulation and the use of certain accounting practices 
accordingly  many of these operators have announced decreased earnings or anticipated earnings shortfalls and have experienced a significant decline in their stock prices 
these factors have had a detrimental impact on the liquidity of some assisted living operators  which has slowed their growth plans and may have a negative effect on their operating cash flows and ability to pay contractual rent or interest obligations to lq properties 
operators in bankruptcy nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had exposure to carematrix corporation carematrix  an operator  who filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter on november nbsp  as of december nbsp   the net assets related to mortgage financing of the three healthcare facilities operated by carematrix had a net book value before impairment of  interest income of  was recorded on a cash basis during the year ended december nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we continue to monitor carematrix and have not come to a definitive agreement with them 
our management has initiated various actions to protect our interests under our mortgages  including the draw down and renegotiation of certain escrow accounts and agreements 
while the earnings capacity of certain facilities has been reduced and the reductions may extend to future periods  we believe that we have recorded appropriate impairment provisions based on our assessment of current circumstances 
however  upon changes in circumstances  including but not limited to possible foreclosure  there can be no assurance that our investments in these healthcare facilities would not be written down below current carrying value based upon estimates of fair value at such time 
critical accounting policies and estimates nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our combined consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements of lq properties and lq corporation have been prepared in conformity with gaap which require our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
our management evaluates estimates used in preparation of its financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following carrying amount and classification of lodging real estate assets  potential impairment and recognition of sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we evaluate the carrying value and classification of all owned lodging assets on an ongoing basis 
the evaluation process includes a review of current facts and circumstances such as guest satisfaction scores  profitability  changing market conditions  and condition of the property 
as a result of this evaluation process  we identify properties we intend to sell and properties we intend to hold for use 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  with respect to properties we intend to sell  our management begins to initiate marketing efforts upon obtaining authority to sell the property 
the properties that we expect to sell within twelve months are reclassified as assets held for sale and depreciation of the asset ceases upon this reclassification 
we record impairment charges on these properties when the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the property 
these assets are then monitored through the date of sale for potential adjustment based on the offers that we are willing to take under serious consideration and our continued review of facts and circumstances 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  for the assets that may take longer than one year to sell or for those assets we intend to hold and use  we estimate when the assets may be sold or otherwise disposed of 
we apply a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to recovery of the carrying amount of each lodging asset held for use to determine if the undiscounted net cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the property 
if this test results in a loss  we then calculate an impairment loss on the lodging asset held for use by determining the excess of the property s carrying amount over our estimate of fair market value of the asset 
the fair value of those assets becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as we sell the related assets  contracts are reviewed to determine if  a sale has been consummated   a complete transfer of risks and rewards has occurred  and  any contingencies or obligations on our part continue to exist 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had lodging properties classified as held for use with a net book value of  and a related impairment balance of  and lodging properties classified as held for sale with a net book value of  and a related impairment balance of  carrying amount and classification of health care real estate assets  potential impairment and recognition of sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   all of our sale leaseback healthcare assets are classified as held for sale because we expect to sell these assets within the next twelve months 
therefore  these assets are carried at the lesser of fair value less costs to sell or net book value of the asset 
we monitor the carrying amount of these assets on a continual basis through the date of sale for potential adjustment based on the offers that we are willing to take under serious consideration and our continued review of facts and circumstances 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our mortgage healthcare assets also are adjusted for impairment when current information and events indicate that we will be unable to collect all principal and interest due on the mortgage in accordance with the contractual terms 
the amount of impairment recognized is based on an analysis of either the fair value less costs to sell of the underlying property collateralizing the loan or offers that we may seriously be considering 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as we sell the related assets  contracts are reviewed to determine if  a sale has been consummated   a complete transfer of risks and rewards has occurred  and  any contingencies or obligations on our part continue to exist 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had healthcare related sale leaseback assets with a net book value of  with a related impairment balance of  and mortgages receivable of  with a related impairment balance of  goodwill nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included goodwill assets totaling approximately  related to two of our reporting units  the lodging unit and the telecommunications unit 
in preparation for implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
nbsp  sfas nbsp  goodwill and other intangible assets  we determined  what our reporting units are  and  what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we completed an initial analysis of the fair value of these components of goodwill and anticipate an impairment loss of approximately  upon implementation of sfas nbsp  on january nbsp   which will be reported as a cumulative change in accounting principle as more fully described below under the heading newly issued accounting pronouncements 
as a result  we also anticipate a decrease in annual amortization of goodwill and a corresponding annual increase to net income of  related to the adoption of sfas nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition  we previously included an intangible asset related to our previous grandfathered paired share structure in goodwill 
in december nbsp  we evaluated the future net cash flows of the tax benefits due to the reversal of the grandfathered paired share tax treatment in connection with our restructuring 
based on our analysis  we estimated that the intangible s fair value was zero and wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  intangible assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included two intangible assets totaling approximately  related to our lodging brands  la quinta inns reg  and la quinta inn nbsp  amp  suites reg  and a year non compete agreement 
we recently completed a reevaluation of the fair value of both intangibles in conjunction with our restructuring and in preparation for implementation of sfas nbsp  as more fully described below under the heading newly issued accounting pronouncements whereby we determined that there was no indication of impairment 
we are in the process of reevaluating the useful life of our lodging brand intangibles and have determined that the useful life of the year non compete intangible is appropriate 
we will implement the provisions of sfas nbsp  on january nbsp  and do not anticipate a material impact on the results of our operations as it relates to these intangible assets 
carrying value of trade and other receivables and related bad debt allowance and expense nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   we had approximately  in trade receivables with a related bad debt allowance of  we continually review the aging of our trade receivables and provide a bad debt reserve for all balances over nbsp  days old 
we also consider other facts and circumstances such as impending bankruptcy of our customers  credit history  etc 
in determining whether additional trade receivable amounts should be reserved as uncollectible 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we record other receivables net of any applicable discount based on original terms and subsequently adjust for impairment  as appropriate  when  based on current information and events our management determines that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all principal and interest due on the receivable in accordance with contractual terms 
upon determination that a receivable is impaired  the amount of impairment loss is recognized as a valuation allowance based upon an analysis of the net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
income taxes nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  lq properties has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and believes that it has met all the requirements for qualification 
accordingly  no income tax provision is recognized for lq properties except for certain transactions resulting in recognition of capital gains and for taxable reit subsidiaries 
lq properties is liable for state franchise taxes based on net worth in several jurisdictions and has accounted for such taxes on an accrual basis 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   lq properties had nols of approximately nbsp  million  which it can utilize to reduce amounts otherwise required to be distributed as dividends to its stockholders in order to maintain its reit status 
if lq properties utilizes its nols for that purpose and if the internal revenue service subsequently reduces the amount of these nols  lq properties could be required to pay a deficiency dividend to maintain its reit status 
as of december nbsp   lq properties has not utilized nols to offset amounts otherwise distributable to its stockholders 
also  lq properties may be liable for federal alternative minimum tax  or amt  for years in which it utilizes its regular tax loss carryovers 
any such amounts paid will be reflected as a current expense for the year paid 
this expense will be offset by a net deferred tax asset to the extent lq properties believes the amt will be utilized as a credit against lq properties regular tax liability  if any  in subsequent years 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  lq corporation s income tax expense or benefit is based on current taxable earnings before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the temporary differences between assets recognized for financial reporting and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  which require recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   lq corporation had nols of approximately nbsp  million 
accordingly  although it will report federal income tax expense going forward  until the nols are fully utilized  cash taxes paid will be limited to state franchise taxes based on net worth  state income taxes for those jurisdictions that do not follow the federal rules for utilization of nols and amt 
any amt paid will be available as a credit in subsequent years to offset the excess of lq corporation s regular tax liability over its amt liability calculated for those years 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   lq corporation had net deferred tax assets before applicable valuation allowances of approximately nbsp  million 
for taxable years ending on or before december nbsp   lq corporation recorded valuation allowances for its net deferred tax assets  as it did not anticipate recognizing the benefit of those assets within the former paired share structure 
beginning with the first quarter of  our restructuring should enable us to recognize the benefit of our deferred tax assets that will no longer be offset by valuation allowances 
general liability  auto liability and workers compensation reserves nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we maintain a paid loss retrospective deductible insurance plan for commercial general liability gl  automobile liability al and workers compensation wc loss exposures related to our lodging operations 
the primary loss deductible retention limit is currently established at  per occurrence for gl and wc and  per occurrence for al 
the insurance carrier initially pays all losses falling within the insurance coverage and amounts within the deductible limit are then billed to us retrospectively on a monthly basis 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we perform formal reviews of estimates of the ultimate liability for losses and associated expenses within the deductible retention on a bi annual basis 
the estimates are based upon a third party actuarial analysis and projection of actual historical development trends of loss frequency  severity and incurred but not reported ibnr claims as well as traditional issues that affect loss cost such as medical and statutory benefit inflation 
in addition  the actuarial analysis compares our trends against general insurance industry development trends to develop an estimate of ultimate costs within the deductible retention 
large claims or incidents that could potentially involve material amounts are also monitored closely on a case by case basis 
as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included an estimated liability with respect to the deductible retention of approximately  employee healthcare reserves nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we maintain a self insurance program for major medical and hospitalization coverage for our lodging employees and their dependents  which is partially funded by payroll deductions 
payments for major medical and hospitalization to individual participants below specified amounts currently   per individual per year and  per individual for a lifetime maximum are self insured by us 
we base their estimate of ultimate liability on trends in claim payment history  historical trends in ibnr incidents and developments in other cost components such as rising medical costs  projected premium costs  number of participants  etc our liability with respect to employee healthcare reserves is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted accordingly 
as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included an estimated liability with respect to this self insurance program of  litigation and contingencies nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we monitor ongoing litigation and other loss contingencies on a case by case basis as they arise 
losses related to litigation and other contingencies are recognized when the loss is considered probable and the amount is estimable 
returns club reg  customer loyalty program nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as of december nbsp   our balance sheet included a liability of approximately  related to unexpired outstanding free night certificates which have been issued to our customers earning a specified number of credits for previous stays at our hotels 
the estimated liability is based on historical redemption experience  the number of outstanding certificates and the estimated incremental cost of providing a room 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our management continually evaluates estimates related to the areas included above 
these estimates are generally based on historical experience and on various other assumptions  factors and circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities

in accordance with the consensus  we classified such cash rebates or refunds as a reduction of revenues 
the eitf also addresses incentive or loyalty programs such as the la quinta returns club reg
