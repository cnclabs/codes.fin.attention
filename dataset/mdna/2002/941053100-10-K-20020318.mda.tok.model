item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview waste connections  inc is a regional  integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in secondary markets of the western us as of december   we served more than  commercial  industrial and residential customers in california  colorado  iowa  kansas  kentucky  new mexico  minnesota  mississippi  montana  nebraska  oklahoma  oregon  south dakota  tennessee  texas  utah  washington  and wyoming 
as of that date  we owned collection operations and operated or owned transfer stations  subtitle d landfills and recycling facilities 
we intend to pursue an acquisition based growth strategy  and we have acquired businesses from our inception in september through december   with of these acquisitions occurring in excluding debt assumed  the aggregate consideration for acquisitions occurring in  using the purchase method of accounting  was approximately million 
from inception through december   the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition  except for acquisitions accounted for under the poolings of interests method of accounting  which are included for all periods presented 
we anticipate that a substantial part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  as a consequence  additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  if certain customer and billing information is not properly integrated from acquisitions that we close  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   intangible assets represented of our total assets 
accounting for landfills 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized using a units of production method as permitted airspace of the landfill is consumed 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
in determining the amortization rate for a landfill  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfill s permitted capacity 
units of production amortization rates are determined annually for our operating landfills 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
landfill depletion rates are determined by management based on estimates provided by our internal and third party engineers and consider the information provided by surveys which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could result in material increases to our landfill depletion rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we reserve for estimated landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs at the landfills we own 
we will have additional material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of the other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate and that we may own or operate in the future 
the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment is calculated assuming an inflation rate of and a discount rate of 
discounted amounts previously recorded are accreted to reflect the effect of the passage of time 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
general our revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing commercial  industrial and residential services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements or franchise agreements with counties or municipal contracts 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give waste connections the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from services provided under exclusive franchise agreements  long term municipal contracts and governmental certificates 
governmental certificates grant waste connections perpetual and exclusive collection rights in the covered areas 
contracts with counties and municipalities and governmental certificates provide relatively consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
because we bill most residential customers quarterly  subscription agreements also provide a stable source of revenues for waste connections 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities 
the table below shows for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided  prior to intercompany eliminations 
the data below have been restated to give effect to acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
year ended december  collection transfer and processing landfill recycling other we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at the transfer stations and the landfill facilities we own and operate 
most of our transfer and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices for our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a published price index that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from services provided under exclusive municipal contracts and franchise agreements 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended december   and costs of operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
as of december   waste connections owned and or operated transfer stations  which reduce our costs by allowing us to use collection personnel and equipment more efficiently and by consolidating waste to gain more favorable disposal rates that may be available for larger quantities of waste 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation overhead costs associated with our marketing and sales force  professional services and community relations expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and amortization of goodwill for businesses acquired prior to july  and other intangible assets using the straight line method 
as discussed more fully below  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from acquisitions closed after june  will no longer be amortized 
waste connections capitalizes some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
in  we capitalized  of interest related to landfill and transfer station development projects 
at december   we had  in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
we continually evaluate the value and future benefits of our intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the recoverability from future operations using cash flows and income from operations of the related acquired businesses as measures 
under this approach  the carrying value is reduced if it becomes probable that our best estimate for expected future cash flows of the related business would be less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
as of december   there have been no adjustments to the carrying amounts of intangibles resulting from these evaluations 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entities 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquired company among its assets  we first assign value to the tangible assets  followed by intangible assets  including covenants not to compete and certain contracts that are determinable both in terms of size and life 
we determine the value of the other intangible assets by considering  among other things  the present value of the cash flows associated with those assets 
goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed on or before june  is amortized on a straight line basis over the period of expected benefit of years 
accumulated amortization of goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively  the statements effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets  including those meeting new recognition criteria under the statements  will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of  except  as provided for under the statements  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
in  we recognized  of tax deductible goodwill amortization expense and  of non tax deductible goodwill amortization expense 
application of the nonamortization provisions of statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately  in based on goodwill amortization occurring in that will not occur in we estimate our earnings per share will be calculated using basic and diluted shares of million and million  respectively 
we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
prior to june   we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the carrying values as of january  any impairment charge resulting from these transitional tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are currently evaluating the effect sfas no 
will have on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are currently evaluating the effect sfas no 
will have on our financial statements and related disclosures 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statement of operations in thousands and as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  as a as a as a of of of revenue revenue revenue revenues    cost of operations    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    loss on disposal of operations  stock compensation acquisition related expenses  income from operations    interest expense  net    other income expense  net  minority interests  income tax provision    extraordinary charges net income    ebitda margin ebitda margin represents ebitda expressed as a percentage of revenues 
ebitda represents income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as determined by generally accepted accounting principles 
further  ebitda does not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient for items such as working capital  capital expenditures  or to react to changes in our industry or the economy in general 
we believe that ebitda is a frequently used measure that provides additional information for determining our ability to meet debt service requirements and that it is one of the indicators upon which we  our lenders and certain investors assess our financial performance and our capacity to service debt 
we therefore interpret the trends that ebitda depicts as one measure of our liquidity 
because ebitda is not calculated by all companies and analysts in the same fashion  the ebitda measures presented by us may not necessarily be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
therefore  in evaluating ebitda data  investors should consider  among other factors o the non gaap nature of ebitda data  o actual cash flow  o the actual availability of funds for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital  and o the comparability of our ebitda data to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development and landfill closure activities in the future 
we plan to meet our capital needs through various financing sources  including internally generated funds  debt and equity financings 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
at inception  we sold  shares of common stock at per share to our founders and  shares of series a preferred stock at per share 
in may and june  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares in our initial public offering including exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option 
in february  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares in a secondary public offering including exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option and used the proceeds to pay down approximately million of our outstanding debt 
in august  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares in a secondary public offering including exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option and used the proceeds to pay down approximately million of our outstanding debt 
in april  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due april in a rule a private placement 
we received proceeds of approximately million from our private placement of the notes and used these proceeds to repay certain outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
as of december   we had options and warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for which fleet boston financial corp 
acts as agent the credit facility 
however  bank covenant restrictions existing as of december  limited our maximum borrowings including standby letters of credit under the credit facility to million 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under the credit facility  with the interest on million of the outstanding borrowings at prime plus basis points and the interest on million of the outstanding borrowings at libor plus basis points 
the credit facility allows us to issue up to million in stand by letters of credit  which reduce the amount of total borrowings available under the credit facility 
as of december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
virtually all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures in and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our discretion  either the fleet boston financial corp 
base rate plus applicable margin  or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin 
the credit facility places certain business  financial and operating restrictions on waste connections relating to  among other things  the incurrance of additional indebtedness  investments  acquisitions  asset sales  mergers  dividends  distributions and repurchases and redemption of capital stock 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring that specified financial ratios and balances be maintained 
as of december   we are in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facility also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in certain circumstances 
the credit facility is used for i acquisitions  ii capital expenditures  iii working capital  iv standby letters of credit  and v general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual less than obligations total year to years to years over years long term debt      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      long term debt payments include million due under our credit facility 
as of december   our credit facility allows us to borrow up to million 
amount of commitment expiration per period commercial total amounts commitments committed less than year to years to years over years standby letters of credit   performance bonds   total commercial commitments   we can issue up to million of performance bonds under our surety bond facility 
this facility does not have a stated expiration date  however  individual performance bonds issued typically have expiration dates ranging from one to five years 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
million of cash provided by operations was used to fund increases in working capital for the period 
for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions and million was used to fund increases in restricted cash 
cash used for capital expenditures was million  which was primarily for investments in fixed assets  consisting primarily of trucks  containers and other equipment 
cash inflows from investing activities include million received from the disposal of assets 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was provided by million of net borrowings under our various debt arrangements and million of proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises  less million of cash paid for debt issuance costs  million of cash paid to terminate an interest rate swap and million of cash distributions to minority interest holders 
we made approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in in connection with our existing business 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through existing cash  internally generated funds  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to waste connections 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
inflation to date  inflation has not significantly affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation 
however  competitive pressures may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
seasonality based on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap with fleet boston financial corporation 
under the swap agreement  which was effective through december  the interest rate on a million libor based note under the credit facility was effectively fixed with an interest rate of plus an applicable margin 
this rate remained at if libor was less than 
if libor exceeded  the interest rate under the swap agreement would increase one basis point for every libor basis point above 
in may  we entered into another interest rate swap with union bank of california 
under the swap agreement  which was effective through december  the interest rate on a separate million libor based notes under the credit facility was effectively fixed with an interest rate of plus an applicable margin 
in december  we restructured both of the two aforementioned interest rate swap agreements  extending their maturity through december and removing the embedded option features of the agreements 
as of december   the fleet boston swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin and the union bank of california swap had a notional amount of million at a fixed rate of plus applicable margin 
in march  million of the notional amount under the union bank of california swap was terminated because we used the proceeds from our convertible subordinated notes offering to repay million of the libor note  the cash flows of which this swap was designated as hedging 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the million remaining floating rate balance owed under our credit facility and floating rate municipal bond obligations of approximately million associated with madera 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately  all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing facilities and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
we often share the profits from our resale of recycled materials with other parties to our recycling contracts 
for example  certain of our municipal recycling contracts in washington  negotiated before we acquired those businesses  specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
to the extent the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
although there can be no assurance of market recoveries in the event of a decline  because of the provisions within certain of our contracts which pass commodity risk along to the customers  we believe  given historical trends and fluctuations within the recycling commodities market  that a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the prices that were in effect at december  would not have a material impact on our cash flows or pre tax income
