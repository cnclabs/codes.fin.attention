our equipment enables these manufacturers to reduce production costs  increase yields and improve the quality of their products 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end use products in the computer  communications and automotive industries 
we believe we are the leading supplier of advanced laser systems used to improve the production yield of semiconductor devices  high speed test and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic capacitors mlccs and other passive electronic components  and advanced laser systems used to fine tune electronic components and circuitry 
additionally  we produce a family of laser drilling systems for production of high density interconnect hdi circuit boards and advanced electronic packaging  as well as inspection systems and original equipment manufacturer oem machine vision products 
electronics industry overview the electronic content of common items such as computers  communication products and automobiles continues to increase 
for example  markets for consumer oriented electronic products such as wireless telephones  computers  personal digital assistants  pagers  digital cameras and entertainment devices have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that are smaller  lighter and more portable 
in addition  automobile manufacturers now routinely include electronic ignition  anti lock brakes  electronic fuel injection and other electronic systems in place of components that in the past were predominantly mechanical or hydraulic 
the increasing demand for electronic products has been accompanied by the need for faster  smaller  more complex  less expensive and higher quality electronic devices and circuits 
to achieve these higher performance attributes and smaller device sizes  electronic device manufacturers are increasing the circuit densities in these devices and tuning them to precise electrical values 
manufacturers of wireless telephones  for example  must use miniaturized circuits to accommodate the size limitations of their finished products 
these circuits must also be tuned to operate within precise frequency specifications  enabling the existing wireless frequency bands to accommodate more users without interchannel interference 
smaller and lighter requirements also decrease the physical dimensions used in electronic interconnections within the electronic device  its surrounding package and the hdi circuit board on which it is mounted 
higher operating speeds of computers and communications products also require more input and output channels within these packages and between the packages and the hdi circuit board 
the highly competitive consumer markets for electronic products drive the need for increasingly less expensive devices and components 
electronic devices and components are produced in large unit volumes and their production and testing is highly automated  utilizing a variety of manufacturing equipment 
manufacturers continuously seek to achieve reduced costs by improving the throughput  yield and quality of device and component production 
for example  semiconductor device manufacturers are continuing a transition from the use of mm and smaller silicon wafers to mm wafers 
this enables manufacturers to fit significantly more electronic devices on a single silicon wafer 
in addition  decreasing circuit densities enable more devices to be produced on a silicon wafer by reducing the size of each device on the wafer 
the use of larger wafers and the design of smaller devices increases the throughput and capacity of electronic device manufacturing facilities  or fabs 
increasing circuit densities also requires the use of newer materials  such as copper  to create these miniaturized electronic circuits 
to improve production yield  or the number of acceptable devices produced per silicon wafer  device manufacturers are utilizing advanced yield improvement systems  such as memory repair  in the manufacture of memory devices such as dynamic random access memory  or dram  and non memory devices such as logic with embedded memory  digital signal processors dsps and high end electronic game chips 
as semiconductor manufacturers move toward higher densities and more complex architectures  machine vision has also emerged as a critical technology 
by allowing manufacturers to achieve greater precision  increased equipment speed and fewer errors  machine vision is enabling technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process  from wafer production through final assembly and packaging 
in addition  the manufacture and placement of components in the surface mount assembly area requires the high speed and accuracy that can be obtained through integrated machine vision solutions 
our solution we believe our products address the needs of electronic component manufacturers by providing them with a high return on their investment due to measurable production benefits  including improved yield  increased throughput  higher performance  smaller component size  greater reliability and enhanced flexibility

our products semiconductor yield improvement systems 
our yield improvement product line is designed and developed to cost effectively meet the production challenges faced by semiconductor manufacturers  including shrinking circuit sizes  material changes and increased wafer sizes 
as circuit densities in semiconductor memory devices such as dram have increased  manufacturers have built redundant cells into their memory designs and connected them with small links on the device surface 
during the manufacturing process  wafers with hundreds of individual memory devices are tested identifying defective cells 
our laser systems are then used to cut links to disconnect the defective portion and to replace it with one of the redundant cells 
our and series systems address the yield improvement needs of semiconductor manufacturers that utilize mm wafers 
our series systems are designed specifically for the mm wafer market 
this series can be installed to initially process mm wafers and can be later converted to mm wafer processing 
electronic component manufacturing systems 
we design and manufacture products that combine high speed  small parts handling technology with microprocessor based systems to provide highly automated  cost effective solutions for manufacturers of mlccs and other passive components such as arrays  inductors and varistors 
these components are used in circuits that process analog and digital signals or operate at high frequencies in nearly all electronic products 
test systems these products employ high speed handling and positioning techniques t precisely load  test and sort mlccs based on their electrical energy storage capacity  or capacitance  and their electrical energy leakage  or dissipation factor 
termination systems these products apply a conductive material to the ends of ceramic capacitors permitting connection of the device in a circuit on a high density printed wiring board pwb 
visual inspection systems these products perform six sided automated inspection of mlccs and arrays for dimensional criteria and defects 
consumable products we also produce consumables such as carrier plates and termination belts  both of which are used to hold capacitors while conductive material is applied 
advanced electronic packaging systems 
our laser drilling products are targeted at applications requiring the highest accuracy and smallest via  or hole  dimensions  in order to create electrical connections between layers in high density circuit boards and electronic packages 
we offer drilling and routing technology to address the rapidly changing applications in integrated circuit ic packages  multi chip modules and hdi circuit boards 
our systems utilize either ultraviolet or co laser technology and come in single head or dual head configurations depending on customer requirements 
our series single head laser drills utilize lasers to drill via holes as small as microns by comparison  a human hair is approximately microns in diameter in a wide variety of materials  including epoxy  resins  and resin coated copper 
our series laser drills perform the same function as our series  but operate at a significantly higher throughput rate due to the simultaneous operation of two drill heads

our recently introduced system provides three dimensional inspection of devices that are handled and sorted in trays 
we believe this market will grow more rapidly than the two dimensional  tube based market that we have historically addressed 
circuit fine tuning systems 
we design and manufacture application specific laser systems that adjust the electrical performance of a product or assembly containing many circuits by removing a precise amount of material from one or more components in the circuit 
this is done to achieve the desired electrical specification for the entire product 
this process is called functional trimming  and is performed while the product or assembly is under power 
for example  in wireless phones  laser trimming of a few selected components in the product is used to tune the product to the desired frequency 
our circuit fine tuning systems also adjust the resistance value of discrete resistors manufactured on ceramic substrates for use in surface mount technology end products 
typically  these discrete devices are produced at resistance values to below nominal levels and need to be trimmed to resistance value with very high accuracy 
our systems meet the demands for high volume  high accuracy miniature resistor trimming through precise positioning of the laser beam and high speed measurement capability 
our circuit fine tuning systems include our model trimming systems which trim chip resistors  our series laser trimming systems which are used to trim thick and thin film hybrid circuits on ceramic and organic substrates  and our recently introduced model thin film on silicon trimming system 
we have also used our expertise in precise laser machining trimming to develop additional products that expand our markets and applications 
these include the series micro machining system  which can be used in multiple applications  including the cutting and scoring of silicon  machining of disk heads  and cutting optoelectronic components and other electronic circuits  and the series embedded passive trimming system  which trims resistors that have been embedded between layers of circuit boards to save space and improve system performance

decreases in work in process and finished goods were directly related to decreased sales 
current liabilities decreased million due to lower compensation accruals  which resulted from lower volume of business and decreased profitability 
investing activities net cash of million was used in investing activities 
we made net purchases of marketable securities of million and property  plant and equipment purchases in the amount of million to upgrade computing and manufacturing capabilities  and to renovate office and manufacturing space and to improve their utilization 
financing activities net cash of million was provided by financing activities in fiscal net proceeds of million were generated by our sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due million was generated by stock option exercises and sales under the employee stock purchase plan 
capital commitments we have committed approximately million for construction of a  square foot corporate headquarters building located on the portland  oregon campus 
we expect that the facility will be completed in september critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
pursuant to december securities and exchange commission guidance to all registrants  we have prepared the following discussion of critical accounting policies 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  inventory writedowns  product warranty reserves  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition we recognize systems  spare parts and other product revenue when the product has been delivered  risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is highly probable 
we design  market and sell our products as standard configurations 
accordingly  customer acceptance provisions are based on seller specified criteria  which we demonstrate prior to shipment 
revenue on new products is deferred until we have established a record of customer acceptance on these new products 
when customer specified objective criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance 
revenue associated with service or maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the contract  which is generally one year 
inventory writedowns we regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions  as well as other factors 
purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least monthly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel 
raw material obsolescence writedowns are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed at least monthly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
we record writedowns for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand into our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
product warranty reserves we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties quarterly 
we offer a standard one year warranty to our customers 
we track historical system reliability on an individual system basis 
costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered 
this data is then used to calculate the accrual based on actual sales for each system and remaining warranty periods 
if circumstances change or if a dramatic change in warranty related incidents occurs  our estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
on certain foreign sales  we require letters of credit 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
factors that may affect future results the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  and similar words  constitute forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
from time to time we may issue other forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ 
the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
factors that may result in such variances include  but are not limited to the following the industries that comprise our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of components and circuitry used in wireless communications  computers  automotive electronics and other electronic products 
in the past  the markets for electronic devices have experienced sharp downturns 
during these downturns  electronics manufacturers  including our customers  have delayed or canceled capital expenditures  which has had a negative impact on our financial results 
the current economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in demand for our products and significant fluctuations in our profitability and net sales 
we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal on net sales of million 
this reflects a significant decrease from net income of million in fiscal on net sales of million 
we cannot assure you when  or if  demand for our products will increase 
during any downturn  including the current downturn  it will be difficult for us to maintain our sales levels 
as a consequence  in order to maintain profitability we will need to reduce our operating expenses 
however  much of our operating expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce such expenses is limited 
moreover  we may be unable to defer capital expenditures  and we will need to continue investment in certain areas such as research and development 
we may incur charges related to impairment of assets and inventory write offs 
we also may experience delays in payments from our customers 
the combined effect of this will have a negative effect on our financial results 
if the markets for our products improve  we must attract  hire and train a sufficient number of employees  including technical personnel  to meet increased customer demand 
our inability to achieve these objectives in a timely and cost effective manner could have a negative impact on our business 
our recent capacity expansion may not be utilized successfully or effectively  which could negatively affect our business 
we have completed a  square foot manufacturing facility on a acre parcel in klamath falls  oregon 
in june  we began construction of a  square foot corporate headquarters building in portland  oregon 
both projects have been funded with existing capital resources and internally generated funds 
our capacity expansion involves risks 
for example  the electronics industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by over capacity and diminished demand for products of the type manufactured by us 
in fiscal we adopted a restructuring plan that involved the closure of several of our manufacturing facilities in response to the current economic downturn 
unfavorable economic conditions affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of our major customers  may affect our ability to successfully utilize our additional manufacturing capacity in an effective manner  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to reduce costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete  if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers  and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase further in the future  and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales 
we depend on a few significant customers and we do not have long term contracts with these or any of our other customers 
twelve large  multinational electronics companies constituted of our fiscal net sales  and the loss of any of these customers could significantly harm our business 
in addition  none of our customers have any long term obligation to continue to buy our products or services  and any customer could delay  reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time 
delays in shipment or manufacturing of our products could substantially decrease our sales for a period 
we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of products with high average selling prices  some with prices as high as million per unit 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of our products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a small number of orders could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
shipment delays could significantly impact our recognition of revenue and could be further magnified by announcements from us or our competitors of new products and technologies  which announcements could cause our customers to defer purchases of our existing systems or purchase products from our competitors 
any of these delays could result in a material adverse change in our results of operations for any particular period 
we depend on manufacturing flexibility to meet the changing demands of our customers 
any significant delay or interruption of manufacturing operations as a result of software deficiencies  natural disasters  or other causes could result in ineffective manufacturing capabilities or delayed product deliveries  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products  including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers to supply materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruption could interrupt our manufacturing 
our business may be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future  and these acquisitions may subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our current business 
although we have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  we have made  and plan in the future to make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of our common stock in a transaction could be dilutive to our shareholders if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be diluted 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board has disallowed the pooling of interests method of acquisition accounting 
this could result is significant charges resulting from amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with future acquisitions 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
the introduction by us or by our competitors of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for our existing products and delays in new product development  and similar delays may occur in the future 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or  where necessary  to license these technologies from others 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
we are exposed to the risks that others may violate our proprietary rights  and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success is dependent upon the protection of our proprietary rights 
in the high technology industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
for example  we have initiated litigation alleging that certain parties have violated various of our patents 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect  however  or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies  applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
for example  in february  cognex corporation filed a lawsuit against us claiming we infringed a patent owned by it 
competitors or others may assert infringement claims against us or our customers in the future with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and legal and regulatory changes 
international shipments accounted for of net sales for fiscal  with of our net sales to customers in asia 
we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including the following periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
in addition  as a result of our significant reliance on international sales  we may also be adversely affected by challenges to us tax laws that benefit companies with certain foreign sales 
in february  the world trade organization wto ruled that foreign sales corporations fscs  which provide an overall reduction in effective tax rates for companies with fscs  violate us obligations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
responding to the wto s decision that fscs constitute an illegal export subsidy  the us government repealed the fsc rules effective october   subject to certain transition rules  and created a new income tax benefit that permanently excludes foreign extraterritorial income from taxable income 
the extraterritorial income eti regime  which applies to transactions after september   provides a similar tax benefit for export sales as the fsc regime did 
following a european union eu complaint  the wto concluded in august that the eti provisions are also not wto compliant as such provisions violate the gatt agreements 
the united states appealed the decision  but in january  an appellate body denied the appeal 
a wto arbitration panel subsequently began consideration of the eu s request for retaliatory tariffs  a ruling is expected in mid august following the issuance of that ruling  the eu will be in a position to have the authority to begin imposing trade sanctions on us exports up to the level set by the arbitrators and the authority for such sanctions will continue until the united states rectifies the wto violation 
the us government will likely choose to rectify the violation and is considering several options to do so 
it is possible that the us government will repeal the eti regime and if the government does not replace it with an equivalent form of relief  our future results of operations may be adversely affected 
our establishment of direct sales in asia exposes us to the risks related to having employees in foreign countries 
we have established direct sales and service organizations in china  taiwan  korea and singapore 
previously  we sold our products through a network of commission based sales representatives in these countries 
our shift to a direct sales model in these regions involves risks 
for example  we may encounter labor shortages or disputes that could inhibit our ability to effectively sell and market our products 
we also are subject to compliance with the labor laws and other laws governing employers in these countries and we will incur additional costs to comply with these regulatory schemes 
additionally we will incur new fixed operating expenses associated with the direct sales organizations  particularly payroll related costs and lease expenses 
if amounts saved on commission payments formerly paid to our sales representatives do not offset these expenses  our operating results may be adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive  and if we fail to compete our business will be harmed 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products 
furthermore  our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by our competitors 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products  and more effectively retain existing customers and obtain new customers 
in addition  new companies may in the future enter the markets in which we compete  further increasing competition in those markets 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including performance of our products  quality of our products  reliability of our products  cost of using our products  our ability to ship products on the schedule required  quality of the technical service we provide  timeliness of the services we provide  our success in developing new products and enhancements  existing market and economic conditions  and price of our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  and loss of market share 
recent terrorist attacks have increased uncertainties for our business 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the recent terrorist attacks on the united states  including the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown  the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new us employees in such facilities  and the risk of more frequent instances of shipping delays 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of managerial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may not be able to retain our key managerial  engineering and technical employees 
our growth may be dependent on our ability to hire a new chief executive officer  new highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  and personnel that can implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
attracting qualified personnel is difficult  and our recruiting efforts to attract and retain these personnel may not be successful 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of june   our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale  therefore  the impact of interest rate changes is reflected as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or the results of our operations 
our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due are at a fixed interest rate 
therefore  there is no associated volatility 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
derivatives are used to manage well defined foreign currency risks 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
the impact of exchange rates on the forward contracts will be substantially offset by the impact of such changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates on the forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged positions  denominated in japanese yen  would not be material to our financial position or the results of our operations
