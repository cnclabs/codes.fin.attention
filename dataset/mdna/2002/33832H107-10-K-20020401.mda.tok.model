during  flag repaid  in advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb prior to their original maturity date and incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately  these advances were repaid due to a falling interest rate environment in which flag could obtain new borrowings at significantly lower rates 
it is anticipated that flag s future interest expense  including the prepayment penalty  will be reduced over the life of the new borrowings 
this redemption of debt has been recorded as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes of approximately  in the statement of earnings 
net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities is the single largest component of flag s operating income 
the management of net interest income is of most importance in the banking industry 
flag manages this income source while it controls credit  liquidity  and interest rate risks 
net interest income decreased in  from million in to million in net interest income decreased in compared to net interest income decreased in due to a decrease in net earning assets as well as a decrease in the interest rates earned on those net earning assets 
total interest income decreased in and decreased in interest expense decreased approximately in and decreased in the interest expense variances from year to year have been primarily influenced by the average balances of interest bearing liabilities see tables table consolidated average balances  interest  and rates taxable equivalent basis dollars in thousands years ended december  interest weighted interest weighted interest weighted average income average average income average average income average balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate assets interest earning assets loans       taxable investment securities       tax free investment securities    interest bearing deposits in other banks   federal funds sold

interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities consolidated average balances  interest  and rates net interest income is determined by the amount of interest earning assets compared to interest bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs 
the difference between the weighted average interest rates earned on interest earning assets ie  loans and investment securities and the weighted average interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities ie  deposits and borrowings is called the net interest spread 
another measure of the difference in interest income earned versus interest expense paid is net interest margin 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets 
table presents for the three years ended december   average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the weighted average interest rates earned and paid on those balances 
in addition  interest rate spreads  net interest margins and the ratio of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities for those years are presented

the increases in other income in resulted from the increase in gain on the sales of branches  offset by decreases in the gains on the sale of investment securities and loans 
effective december   flag sold selected loans  deposits and property of its branches in milan and mcrae  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately  gain on sale of loans increased to  in versus  in the increase was a result of increased volumes in the sale of mortgage loans  servicing released  as a result of increased mortgage refinancing activity during during  flag sold the loans  deposits and property of its bank branches in cobbtown  metter and statesboro  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately  flag also sold the loans  deposits and property of its bank branches in blackshear  homerville and waycross  georgia and recognized a gain on sale of approximately  gains on investment securities decreased  in from due to losses in the amount of  on the sale of investment securities which were incurred as a strategy to restructure the investment portfolio to take advantage of a higher interest rate environment 
gain on sale of loans decreased to  in versus  in this decrease was due in part to a one time gain on the sale of the guaranteed portion of a commercial loan during in the amount of  as well as decreased volume in the sale of mortgage loans  servicing released 
fees and service charges on deposits remained stable at approximately million in compared to fees and service charges on deposits decreased slightly from to non interest expenses salary and employee benefits decreased to million in from million in and from million in this decrease in and was primarily due to reduced salary and employee benefits attributed to the sale of the branch offices during the third quarter of as well as management s continued emphasis on consolidation and cost containment in an effort to increase the efficiency of our operations 
management also believes consolidation efficiencies will continue to be realized as operations are combined in the current single charter environment 
occupancy expenses decreased to million in from million in and decreased from million in the decrease in occupancy expenses was predominately the result of a decrease in depreciation expense on certain fixtures and equipment  as well as a decrease in occupancy expenses attributed to the sale of branches during the increase in occupancy expenses was the result of an increase in depreciation on certain fixtures and equipment 
other expenses were million in versus million in and million in the decrease in and other expenses was the result of a decrease in operating expenses attributed to the sale of branch offices during the third quarter of  as well as a decrease in data processing  item processing and imaging expenses as a result of bringing these operations in house 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity  while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of flag s balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and providing securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
investment securities increased million to million at december  from million at december  at december   all investment securities outstanding were classified as available for sale 
the overall increase in investments was due to the investment of proceeds received from the sale of the branch locations during at december   gross unrealized gains in the total portfolio amounted to  and gross unrealized losses amounted to  table reflects the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio for the past three years

loans gross loans receivable decreased by approximately million in to million from million at december  this decrease was the result of declines in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  installment loans  and real estate mortgages  partially offset by an increase in real estate construction loans and lease financings 
the decrease in loans in is largely attributable to the sale of real estate mortgage loans during as well as the sale of loans in connection with the branch sales during as shown in table  real estate mortgage loans decreased approximately million  commercial  financial and agricultural loans decreased approximately million  installment loans decreased approximately million  lease financing receivables increased approximately million  and real estate construction loans increased approximately million

an allowance for possible losses is provided through charges to flag s earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses

the provision for included additional provisions in the amount of  made for certain loans retained as a result of the homerville  ga 
branch sale  as well as an additional provision in the amount of  made for a large agricultural credit located in southeast georgia 
management determines the level of the provision for loan losses based on outstanding loan balances  the levels of non performing assets  and reviews of assets classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss and larger credits  together with an analysis of historical loss experience  and current economic conditions 
as shown in table  the year end allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  the increase in the allowance at december  was due primarily to the lower charge offs during total charge offs were million in  million in  and million in the allowance for loan losses was of net outstanding loans at december   versus of net outstanding loans at december   and of net outstanding loans at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is both adequate and appropriate 
however  the future level of the allowance for loan losses is highly dependent upon loan growth  loan loss experience  and other factors  which cannot be anticipated with a high degree of certainty

as part of the company s renewed credit culture  a special assets division has been established for the purpose of managing all nonperforming assets

deposits and borrowings total deposits decreased approximately million during  totaling million at december  versus million at december  total deposits decreased during from levels of due primarily to the sale of branches during the maturities of time deposits of  or more issued by the bank at december   are summarized in table table maturities of time deposits over  dollars in thousands three months or less  over three months through six months 
 over six months through twelve months 
 over twelve months  at december   the bank was a shareholder in the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlba 
through this affiliation  advances totaling million were outstanding at rates competitive with time deposits of like maturities 
management anticipates continued utilization of this short and long term source of funds to minimize interest rate risk and to fund competitive fixed rate loans to customers 
during  flag repaid  in advances from the fhlb prior to their original maturity date 
these advances were repaid due to a falling interest rate environment in which flag could obtain new borrowings at significantly lower rates 
asset liability management a primary objective of flag s asset and liability management program is to control exposure to interest rate risk the exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates so as to enhance its earnings and protect its net worth against potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
historically  the average term to maturity or repricing rate changes of assets primarily loans and investment securities has exceeded the average repricing period of liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings 
table provides information about the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december   that are expected to mature  prepay  or reprice in each of the future time periods shown ie  the interest rate sensitivity 
as presented in this table  at december   the liabilities subject to rate changes within one year exceeded its assets subject to rate changes within one year 
this mismatched condition subjects flag to interest rate risk within the one year period because the assets  due to their generally shorter term to maturity or repricing  are more sensitive to short term interest rate changes than the liabilities 
it is management s belief that the result of this position would be a decrease in net interest income if market interest rates rise and an increase in net interest income if market interest rates decline 
management carefully measures and monitors interest rate sensitivity and believes that its operating strategies offer protection against interest rate risk 
as required by various regulatory authorities  flag s board of directors has established an interest rate risk policy  which sets specific limits on interest rate risk exposure 
adherence to this policy is reviewed quarterly by the board of directors asset liability committee 
management has maintained positive ratios of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

  liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet the ongoing operational cash needs of flag and to take advantage of income producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of flag to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining flag s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that flag can also meet the investment requirements of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and use of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as the closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
real estate construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to million  or  of the total loan portfolio at december  other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlba advances  other borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent flag s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in flag s consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the major sources of cash provided by operating activities are net income and the changes in other assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of funds used for cash paid in branch sales as well as to purchase securities available for sale  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available for sale 
net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a million net decrease in deposits and a net decrease in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements of million 
in the opinion of management  flag s liquidity position at december   is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
reference should be made to the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in the consolidated financial statements for the three year analysis of the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating  investing and financing activities 
capital resources and dividends stockholders equity at december   decreased from december  this decrease resulted from the purchase of treasury stock as well as the payment of dividends  partially offset by net income and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
dividends of million or 
per share were declared in and average stockholders equity as a percent of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
the ratio of average stockholders equity to average total assets was for and for table summarizes these and other key ratios for flag for each of the last three years 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia required federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with regard to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
as a result of fdicia  the federal banking agencies introduced an additional capital measure called the tier risk based capital ratio 
the tier ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk adjusted total assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements presents a summary of fdicia s capital tiers compared to flag s and the banks actual capital levels

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the liquidity and maturity structures of flag s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels
