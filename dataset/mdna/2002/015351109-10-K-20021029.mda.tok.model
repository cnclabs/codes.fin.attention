item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors attached hereto as exhibit overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders  inflammation and cancer 
since our incorporation in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
additionally  through our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  or aat  we are engaged in the discovery and development of a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs 
our two lead product candidates are antibodies that address specific diseases that arise when the human immune system attacks the human body itself and produces undesired inflammation 
antibodies are proteins that bind specifically to selected targets  or antigens  in the body 
after the antibody binds to its target  it may activate the body s immune system against the target  block activities of the target or stimulate activities of the target 
we are currently examining our two lead antibody product candidates  pexelizumab and eculizumab  in eight different clinical development programs 
through aat  our wholly owned subsidiary with extensive combinatorial human antibody library technologies and expertise  we have developed important additional capabilities to discover and develop additional antibody product candidates for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer 
we are also developing therapies employing the transplantation of cells from other species into humans  known as xenotransplantation 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of our products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and commercial manufacturing and developing a sales and marketing force and we may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs 
we plan to develop and commercialize on our own those product candidates for which the clinical trials and commercialization requirements can be funded and accomplished by our own resources 
for those products which require greater resources  our strategy is to form corporate partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies for product development and commercialization  where we will stay play a major role 
in december  we and p g entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  pursuant to which we and p g revised our january collaboration 
under the revised structure  we and p g share decision making and responsibility for all future united states  or us  development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab  including clinical  manufacturing  marketing  and sales efforts 
prior to december  
table of contents p g was generally funding all clinical development and manufacturing costs for pexelizumab 
per the mou  our revised collaboration with p g provides for us and p g to each incur approximately of all phase iii clinical trial  product development and manufacturing  and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the us and that each firm will receive an approximate equal share of the gross margin on us sales  if any 
p g agreed to retain responsibility and costs for future development and commercialization outside the us  with us receiving a royalty on sales to the rest of the world  if any 
we are responsible for royalties on certain third party intellectual property worldwide  if such intellectual property is necessary 
additionally  as part of the mou  we will receive milestone payments for achieving specified development steps  regulatory filings and approvals  but will not receive previously agreed sales milestones and will generally forego further research and development support payments from p g 
as part of the revised collaboration per the mou  p g agreed to continue to fund of the costs to complete the two on going phase ii clinical trials in myocardial infarction or heart attack patients that recently completed enrollment 
we have agreed to bear the first of projected costs associated with the cabg phase iii clinical trial and p g will bear the second  with a final adjustment to make even the sharing of costs 
we and p g have agreed that each will share concurrently of the on going us pre production and development manufacturing costs of pexelizumab as well as any future ami phase iii clinical trial costs 
a letter of understanding has been signed relating to the negotiation and completion of an agreement with a third party manufacturer for the large scale commercial manufacture of pexelizumab over five years 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  collaborative  royalty and license arrangements  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues we record contract research revenues from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments under collaboration with third parties  and amounts received from various government grants 
up front  non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
unbilled reimbursable contract costs as shown on our consolidated balance sheets represent reimbursable costs incurred in connection with research contracts which have not yet been billed 
we bill these costs and recognize the costs and related revenues in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 

table of contents research and development expenses we record research and development expenses when they are incurred unless recoverable under contract 
research and development expenses include the following major types of costs salaries and benefit costs  research license fees and various contractor costs  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities and leasehold improvements  building and utilities costs related to research space and lab supplies 
goodwill at july   we carry million of goodwill  net  acquired in connection with our acquisition of prolifaron see financial note no 
 representing the excess cost over fair value of the net assets acquired 
on a prospective basis  this goodwill or any long lived investment asset is subject to annual impairment reviews 
impairment charges  if any  will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined  if any 
results of operations fiscal years ended july    and we earned contract research revenues of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to decreased research payments from procter gamble pharmaceuticals  or p g  resulting from our december agreement per a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  to revise our collaboration agreement with p g and the completion of the phase ii pexelizumab cpb study 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to the lower research payments resulting from our completion of the phase ii pexelizumab cpb study 
during fiscal year  we incurred research and development expenses of million 
for fiscal years and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year as compared to was attributable to higher clinical trial costs associated primarily with the phase iii pexelizumab primo cabg trial as a result of the revised collaboration agreement with p g which required us to share in the pexelizumab development costs and greater clinical manufacturing costs associated with our two lead product candidates pexelizumab and eculizumab 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal as compared to was primarily attributable to lower clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs associated with the completion of phase ii pexelizumab cpb study 
these lower costs were offset by increased costs from clinical trials  manufacturing development  and manufacturing of other lead c inhibitor product candidate  eculizumab  and the consolidated on going research and development costs of aat which was formed through the september acquisition from prolifaron 
the acquisition of prolifaron in fiscal resulted in a one time  non cash charge of million allocated to in process research and development projects 
in addition  the company recognized approximately million of the purchase price as goodwill which was being amortized over the seven years following purchase 
the amortization of this goodwill resulted in a charge of million in the twelve months ended july  effective august   the company s adoption of sfas no 
caused the amortization of goodwill to cease 
our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as 
table of contents compared to was principally due to higher payroll related costs 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to was principally due to increased personnel and professional fees  as well as higher facilities expenses resulting from our relocation and expansion of our operations to support our growth  including our acquisition of prolifaron 
total operating expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
total operating expenses in the twelve months ended july  included the one time non cash in process research and development charge and the non cash amortization of goodwill 
other income  net  was million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year as compared to was due to decreased interest income from lower cash balances and lower market interest rates 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to was due to increased interest income from higher cash balances resulting primarily from the million of net proceeds received from the sale of common stock in november a state tax benefit of million was recognized in fiscal year resulting from the company s exchange of its fiscal incremental research and development tax credit 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million non cash charge that is related to the cumulative change in accounting principle per the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab we adopted sab in fiscal year and therefore changed our revenue recognition policy for up front non refundable payments from immediate recognition to deferral of the revenue with the up front fee amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement 
we recognized the non cash cumulative effect adjustment of million as of august  included in each of fiscal years and were contract revenues of million related to the sab amortization of the up front  non refundable payment over the life of the agreement 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred a net loss of million  million  and million or   and basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
shown below are our statements of operations for fiscal years ended   and excluding the impact of the non cash charges resulting from our acquisition of prolifaron and the cumulative effect of sab  we incurred a pro forma net loss of million or basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal year ended july

as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million compared to million as of july  at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million that we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due to the use of funds to fund our operations and capital equipment investments 
as of july   we have invested million in property and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase significantly for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources together with the anticipated funding from our revised collaboration with p g  as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twenty four months 
this should also provide us adequate funding for the clinical testing of our c inhibitor product candidates and support our broad research and development of our additional product candidates 

table of contents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist principally of our million of convertible subordinated notes  a million note payable  our operating leases principally for facilities and equipment  and an open letter of credit of  which serves as a security deposit on our facility lease in cheshire  connecticut 
we have no outstanding capital leases 
we have cancelable research and development and clinical and manufacturing development cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses  aggregating million over the next three years 
and  if and when we achieve specified contractual milestones related to product development and product license applications and approvals  additional payments would be required if we elect to continue and maintain our licenses with our licensors  aggregating up to million 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  commercial commitments  and anticipated supporting arrangements subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods amounts in millions and thereafter contractual obligations subordinated convertible notes note payable operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments and anticipated supporting arrangements clinical and manufacturing development licenses research and development total commercial commitments interest on our million convertible subordinated notes due march  is payable semi annually in september and march of each year

we may also elect to pay the repurchase price for some or all the notes in cash or common stock 
interest on our million note payable due in may  bearing interest at per annum  is payable quarterly 
this note payable was used to finance certain manufacturing assets acquired in february  principally land  buildings and laboratory equipment  for the xenograft program developed by tyco healthcare  formerly known as us surgical corporation 
the principal balance under the note is due in may security for this term note is the manufacturing assets that we purchased 
we are looking to leverage our opportunities in this program as we complete optimization of manufacturing methods for the unigraft cells tissue to enable clinical development 
if we are unable to secure a collaboration to share in the future funding of the development and clinical trials  we may be unable to maximize the value in this program  and subsequently  may have to reduce our financial commitment to the program 
this may cause a delay or termination of our unigraft program  and impairment to our unigraft manufacturing assets resulting in a write down of a portion of those assets 
as of july   the carrying value of those assets was approximately million 

table of contents we lease our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut that we relocated to in november the lease has an initial term of ten years and six months  expiring in december at this site  we lease a total of  square feet of space  which includes approximately  square feet related to research and laboratories 
we have incurred initial leasehold improvements aggregating approximately million 
in addition  we are paying a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
our pilot manufacturing plant  which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials  is expected to remain in new haven  connecticut and encompasses approximately  square feet of labs and offices 
we are on a month to month rental and are currently negotiating a longer term arrangement for the facilities in new haven  connecticut 
we believe our research and development facilities and our pilot manufacturing facility will be adequate for our current ongoing activities 
alexion antibody technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  leases approximately  square feet of labs and office space in san diego  california 
the lease has a term of ten years  expiring in august in december  we and p g entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  pursuant to which we and p g revised our january collaboration 
under the revised structure  we will share decision making and responsibility for all future us development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab  including clinical  manufacturing  marketing  and sales efforts 
prior to december  p g was generally funding all clinical development and manufacturing costs for pexelizumab 
the revised collaboration per the mou provides for us and p g to each incur approximately of all phase iii clinical trial  product development and manufacturing  and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the us and that each firm will receive an approximate equal share of the gross margin on us sales  if any

we and p g have agreed that each will share concurrently of the on going us pre production and development manufacturing costs of pexelizumab as well as any future ami phase iii clinical trial costs 
the parties have agreed to secure commercial manufacturing capacity for pexelizumab 
a letter of understanding has been signed relating to the negotiation and completion of an agreement with a third party manufacturer for large scale commercial production 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration at any time 
if p g terminates prior to incurring its of the cabg phase iii clinical trial costs  then p g will not be required to contribute towards its approximately equal share of the us cabg phase iii clinical trial costs and p g will be released from its future funding obligations 
in addition  p g would offer to assign any pexelizumab third party manufacturing agreements and we could be obligated to assume all future costs there under and reimburse p g for its prior payments thereunder 
if p g terminates  all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab will revert back to us and we will be entitled to all future pexelizumab revenues  if any  without any sharing of revenues  if any  with p g 
if we were to continue development of pexelizumab  our costs would increase significantly as we would need to fund development and commercialization of pexelizumab on our own or identify a new collaboration partner 

table of contents we expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts and continue to conduct clinical trials and develop manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our operating expenses will depend on many factors  including the progress  timing and scope of our research and development programs  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes  arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities  the time and cost necessary to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies  and any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs for research  pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacturing process development  additional capital expenditures related to personnel and facilities expansion  clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements  secure commercial contract manufacturing capacity  and marketing and sales in order to commercialize our products currently under development 
furthermore  we will owe royalties to parties we have licensed intellectual property from  or may in the future license intellectual property from  in connection with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
in addition to milestone payments we may receive from our collaboration with p g and our interest and investment income that are subject to market interest rate fluctuations  we will need to raise or generate substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commercialization of all of our product candidates 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us 
our additional financing may include public or private debt or equity offerings  equity line facilities  bank loans  collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners  and or the sale or licensing of some of our property 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that discussions with potential strategic or collaborative partners will result in any agreements on a timely basis  if at all 
the unavailability of additional financing when and if required could require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and product development programs or to license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourselves  any of which could have a material adverse effect 
for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  which expire through of which approximately million resulted from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and million of tax credit carryforwards  which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we believe that we have triggered these limitation provisions
