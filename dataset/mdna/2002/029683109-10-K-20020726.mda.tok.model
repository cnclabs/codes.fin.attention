these vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products 
to support our direct sales force  we conduct marketing programs that include public relations  direct marketing  advertising  trade shows  product seminars  industry speakers  user group conferences and ongoing customer communication programs 
the price for our products typically is determined based upon the number of modules licensed and the number of servers  users and sites for which the solution is designed 
during the fiscal year ended april   license fees generally ranged from  to million 
licenses like many business application software firms  we typically enter into license agreements that grant non exclusive rights to use our products 
our standard license agreements contain provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software 
these agreements warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation 
these licenses generally limit the use of the software to a specific number of individual users and servers for a one time fee 
a significant portion of the license fee is generally payable upon the delivery of product documentation  with the balance due upon installation

table of contents competition the market for enterprise applications is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product offerings and other market activities 
in the application software market  we compete with a variety of software vendors including internet application vendors in the enterprise application software market segment  vendors in the manufacturing software application market segment  vendors in the emerging enterprise resource optimization software solutions market segment  providers of human resource management system software products  providers of financial management systems software products  internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments  and numerous other firms that offer products and services with new or advanced features 
in particular  approximately six firms that market mainframe application software products and over thirty firms that market midrange and client server application software products are significant competitors for one or more of our products 
as a result  the market for business application software and related services has been and continues to be intensely competitive 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering favorable terms 
in addition  we believe we must differentiate ourselves through different or more subtle architectural and technological factors 
some of our competitors may have an advantage over us due to their  significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours  and larger installed base 
furthermore  potential customers may consider outsourcing options  including application service providers  data center outsourcing and service bureau as viable alternatives to licensing our software products 
we believe that purchasers of software products when comparing our products and services to those of our competitors  are principally concerned with the range of product modules available  ease of integration  variety of features  performance  simplicity of use  documentation  technical support and training 
we further believe that our software products and services are competitive in these areas 
price considerations are a key factor and we believe our pricing is competitive 
we believe the market trend to open systems  allowing software to operate across hardware platforms  will increase the number of competitors and intensity of competition 
we believe that it is necessary for us to expend significant development monies annually to remain competitive in the marketplace 
trademarks and copyrights we seek to protect our proprietary interest in software products and trade secrets 
we maintain non disclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with customers  consultants  employees and others 
while the strict enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured  we believe that they provide a deterrent to the use of information which may be proprietary to us and in the event of any breach of 
table of contents such agreements  we intend to take appropriate legal action 
we copyright our programs and software documentation related to these programs 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each products 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and others have registration applications pending 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection of our intellectual property 
moreover  the laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be licensed do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we believe that the rapid technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to the extent that unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segment overlaps 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others there can be no assurance that any such licenses will remain acceptable to us  if at all 
employees as of april   we had full time employees  including in product research  development and enhancement  in customer support and professional services  in marketing  sales and sales support  and in accounting  facilities and administration 
we believe that our continued success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical  marketing and management personnel  who are in great demand
