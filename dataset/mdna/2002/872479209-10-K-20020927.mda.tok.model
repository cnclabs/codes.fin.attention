item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
business tii network technologies  inc  formerly named tii industries  inc 
company or tii  designs  produces and markets lightning and surge protection products  network interface devices nids and station electronic and other products 
the company has been a leading supplier of overvoltage surge protectors to us telephone operating companies telcos for over years 
restructuring and other charges the continuing telecommunications industry wide slowdown and resulting cutbacks by the service providers in their construction and maintenance budgets  actions taken by the service providers to reduce inventory levels  and a reduction in the number of telephone access lines per subscriber being deployed have had a negative impact on the sales of the company s traditional products over the last several years 
accordingly  during this period the company has been restructuring and downsizing its operations to reduce its cost structure to enable it to operate profitably at lower sales levels and position itself for profitable growth with the recovery of the market for its products 
despite previous industry predictions of a turnaround  this slowdown continued through the end of fiscal as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took additional actions to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
included in these actions was the further downsizing of the company s puerto rico operations with the objective of creating a quick response  low cost assembly and specialty gas tube manufacturing operation and the further expansion of the company s outsourcing strategy 
this action  combined with the consolidation of certain functional departments and management responsibilities into the company s new york headquarters  resulted in additional workforce reductions and the reevaluation of the company s property  plant and equipment requirements  whereby the company retained only those assets consistent with this strategy 
management also reevaluated its home networking strategy and made the decision to discontinue the digital closet product line  which  despite receiving several industry awards  did not achieve expected results 
further  as a result of the continuing telecommunications industry wide slowdown  the company also reevaluated its inventories 
as a result  the company recorded charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million that consisted of million for the write down of inventories determined to be excess or obsolete  million for the impairment of long lived assets and million for severance and other costs 
in the third quarter of fiscal  as part of management s continuing strategy to improve profit margins by finding more cost effective alternative ways of producing its products  and also as a result of the successes under a fiscal re alignment plan  management committed to a plan to further re align its operations 
a key element of the plan was the expansion of the company s outsourcing strategy with contract manufacturers to produce a substantial portion of the remaining components and subassemblies that the company was still manufacturing 
included in this plan  were workforce and production facility reductions  the write down of certain inventories and manufacturing machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements related to manufacturing activities conducted in puerto rico that were outsourced or were used for products that were eliminated  and other cost saving measures 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a net re alignment of operations charge of approximately million  including an inventory write down of approximately million net of a reversal of a remaining allowance of  from a fiscal re alignment charge  million for the write down of net fixed assets  a charge of  for employee termination benefits for a workforce reduction of employees and  for a lease commitment for excess manufacturing space 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments tii s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments 
the company believes that the issues associated with determining the carrying value of the company s inventories and the carrying value of its long lived assets are the most critical areas where management s judgments and estimates affect the company s reported results 
inventories are required to be stated at the lower of cost or market 
in establishing appropriate inventory reserves management assesses the ultimate recoverability of the inventory considering such issues as technological advancements in products as required by the company s customers  changes within the marketplace and general economic conditions 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  misinterpretation of prevailing conditions could result in actual results varying from reported results that are based on the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments as of the balance sheet date 
the company reviews long lived assets  such as fixed assets to be held and used or disposed of  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fiscal years ended june   june  and june  net sales for fiscal decreased million or to million from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the continuing telecommunications industry wide slowdown  cutbacks by telecommunications service providers in their construction and maintenance budgets  actions taken by the service providers to reduce inventory levels and a reduction in the number of telephone access lines per subscriber being deployed

this transaction resulted in a charge of approximately  that was recorded in other income expense 
income taxes due to the company s pre tax losses  there was no tax provision for the three years ended june  prior to july   the company had elected the application of section of the us internal revenue code of  as amended code

the cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was produced from cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities million exceeding the company s net cash loss million

capital resources the company has a credit facility credit facility that consists of a million revolving credit facility and a term loan 
the revolving credit facility enables the company to have up to million of revolving credit loans outstanding at any one time  limited by a borrowing base equal to of the eligible accounts receivable and of the eligible inventory  subject to certain reserves 
as a result of this limitation  the maximum borrowings available to the company was million as of june  subject to extension in certain instances  the scheduled maturity date of revolving credit loans was april   while the term loan is to be repaid in equal installments through march  with a final payment of  subject to mandatory repayments from asset disposition proceeds

due to the repurchase of preferred stock and the loss incurred in the fourth quarter  the company was not in compliance with its tangible net worth covenant at june  on september  the lender amended the loan agreement so that the company was in compliance with the revised covenant and also agreed to an extension of the credit facility until september  funds anticipated to be generated from operations  together with available cash and borrowings under the credit facility  are considered to be adequate to finance the company s current operational and capital needs 
if the slowdown in the telecommunications industry continues or worsens for an extended period of time  or if the company cannot extend or secure a new credit facility under similar terms  the company may need to seek additional capital to support its operations

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board approved sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  may not be amortized 
amortization of existing goodwill will cease upon implementation of sfas no 
sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company does not have any recorded goodwill or other intangible assets associated with business combinations 
therefore  the implementation of sfas no 
 which is effective at the beginning of fiscal for the company  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated statement of operations or consolidated balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this statement provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this statement also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as previously required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
effective at the beginning of fiscal management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued in july sfas no 
 which is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   applies to costs associated with an exit activity  including restructurings  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
requires that exit or disposal costs be recorded as an operating expense when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal by itself will not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense under sfas no 
sfas no 
grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that were previously recorded under eitf issue therefore  the accounting for the costs associated with the company s exit and disposal activities during the three years ended june  will be unaffected upon adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in us dollar interest rates 
the interest payable under the company s credit agreement is principally between and basis points above the london interbank offered rate libor and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
historically  the effects of movements in the market interest rates have been immaterial to the consolidated operating results of the company 
the company requires foreign sales to be paid for in us currency and is billed by its contract manufacturers in us currency 
historically  the company has not purchased or entered into interest rate swaps or future  forward  option or other instruments designed to hedge against changes in interest rates  the price of materials it purchases or the value of foreign currencies
