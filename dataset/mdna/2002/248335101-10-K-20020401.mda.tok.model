item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
although the company reports its financial results in us dollars  approximately of the company s revenues and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies 
the fluctuation of the functional currencies earned by the company against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable us dollar reported denominated income statement amounts in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  warranty obligations and deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company establishes reserves against its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
warranties products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased profits 
deferred tax assets carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would result in a decrease in the company s income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the extent to which it will realize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets annually and assesses the need for adjustments in its valuation allowances

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the operating results of the company has been moderate in recent years reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the company s cost structure 
although inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be effected by inflation in the future 
exposure to currency fluctuations a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the dollar  including pounds sterling  equivalent european euro currencies and japanese yen 
the company s financial statements are prepared in dollars  and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates in the pound sterling and other currencies in which the company does business relative to the dollar may cause fluctuations in reported financial information  which are not necessarily related to the company s operations 
in  for example  the company experienced a increase in net sales in the european region denominated in local currencies  however  the dollar translated net sales figures showed a net increase due to the fluctuation of the dollar against the local currencies of only 
due to the volatility of currency exchange rates  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
although the company currently engages in transactions to hedge a portion of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  it may not do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations or that any hedging techniques implemented by the company will be effective
