item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an infrastructure services company  which designs  deploys and maintains telecommunications  electrical  life safety and other systems 
we deliver a full spectrum of services including engineering  management  deployment and installation in local metropolitan markets 
our principal focus is to provide the expertise and resources our customers need to design  build  and operate their infrastructure systems 
we generally offer our services hours a day  seven days a week 
during our most recent fiscal years  our customers included primarily competitive local exchange carriers  internet service providers and carriers carriers 
given the current market conditions in the telecommunications industry  we have taken steps to broaden our customer base to include large enterprise customers  the real estate community and government entities and to diversify our service offerings to include systems integration  electrical contracting  installation of security systems  and other infrastructure services 
we have offices in new york  boston  washington dc  philadelphia  miami  long island  white plains and in new jersey 
for the years and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues was earned from services provided in the new york metropolitan region  including new york city  new jersey  long island and white plains 
our cost of revenues includes compensation and benefits of employees working directly on projects  overhead costs including supervision and support  vehicles  facilities expenses  tools and equipment  and other direct project related expenses 
labor and related benefits comprise the largest portion of our cost of revenues because our customers generally furnish most of the materials required for each project 
however  where we provide program management services  we may be responsible for providing the required materials as well as any subcontracting services 
general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits  facilities expenses  and other expenses not related to supervision and support of employees working directly on projects 
depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of our property and equipment and amortization related to capitalized leases of equipment  leasehold improvements and computer software purchased for internal use 
as of december   we had employees working directly on projects and employees providing supervision  support  and general  administrative and marketing functions 
our customers for the design and deployment of telecommunications networks include large  well established telecommunications carriers as well as smaller  early stage telecommunications carriers 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for the years and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenues from our largest customer  and and  respectively  of our revenues from our second largest customer 
the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from period to period  and a major customer in one period may require a lesser amount of our services in a subsequent period 
several of our telecommunications carrier customers who provided us with significant revenues in   and or have experienced financial difficulties and have curtailed their capital expenditures 
as a result  revenues from those customers have declined and we do not expect to continue to derive future revenue from those customers 
we intend to derive other revenues page by providing our services to new customers  but no assurance of our success in replacing those revenues can be given 
on january   we repurchased common shares owned by a stockholder and issued a subordinated promissory note in the amount of million bearing interest at per year 
we make quarterly payments of million plus interest on that note and as of december   a balance of million was outstanding 
on july   we converted from an s corporation to a c corporation 
prior to becoming a c corporation  our stockholders were taxed individually for their share of our profits 
until july   our financial statements did not reflect a provision for federal income taxes 
subsequent to that date  we have recorded federal income taxes at the standard statutory c corporation rates based on pre tax income 
for the year  our financial statements reflect an income tax provision based on pre tax income earned from july  to december  on august   we completed an initial public offering ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  resulting in our receipt of net proceeds of million 
critical accounting policies for most of our projects  revenue and expense is recognized under the completed contract method  in which we recognize revenue and expense when our services have been performed and the projects have been completed 
for projects which have been completed but not yet billed to customers  we recognize revenue based on our estimates of the amounts to be realized 
when such projects are billed  any differences between our initial estimates and the actual amounts billed are recorded as increases or decreases to revenue 
for cost plus projects  in each period we recognize expense as the costs are incurred and we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the costs incurred plus the contractual markup 
for larger projects other than cost plus projects  generally those whose duration is expected to exceed days  we recognize revenue and expense using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  in each period we recognize expense as the costs are incurred and we recognize revenue based on the ratio of the costs incurred for each project to our currently estimated total costs to be incurred for the project  multiplied by the estimated revenue to be earned for the project 
accordingly  the revenue we recognize in a given period depends on our current estimates of the total remaining costs to complete individual projects and the total estimated revenue to be earned for those projects 
if in any period we significantly increase our estimate of the total remaining costs to complete a project or lower our estimate of revenue to be earned for a project  we may recognize no additional revenue or we may reduce previously recorded revenue with respect to that project 
as a result  our gross margin in such period and in future periods may be significantly reduced and in some cases we may recognize a loss on individual projects prior to their completion 
provisions for estimated losses on projects are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
the projects for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting are typically structured with milestone events that dictate the timing of payments to us from our customers 
accordingly  there may be a significant delay between the date we record the revenue and the date we receive payment from our customers 
our customers for these projects may withhold a certain percentage usually from each billing until after the project has been completed and final approvals have been obtained 
non cash stock based compensation expense represents amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting primarily from the grant of stock options or sale of restricted stock at exercise or sale prices subsequently deemed  for financial reporting purposes  to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant or sale date 
deferred stock based compensation also includes the fair value at grant date of options granted to non employees 
to the extent that unvested options are forfeited  previously recorded deferred stock based compensation is reversed 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized to expense over the applicable vesting periods ranging from immediately to up to four years 
deferred tax assets are recorded in connection with amortization of stock based compensation expense related to nonqualified options 
to the extent that vested nonqualified options for which we have recorded deferred tax assets expire unexercised or are exercised at a time when the fair value of the stock is lower than the deemed fair value of the stock for financial reporting purposes on the date the options were granted per share  a portion or all of such deferred tax assets would not be realized and such portion would be charged to expense 
page provision for doubtful accounts represents our estimates of the amounts of our receivables which will be uncollectible 
if in any period there are adverse developments in the financial condition of our customers  we may significantly increase our provision for doubtful accounts 
the amounts of our receivables which will ultimately be collected from each of our customers may differ from our estimates  and accordingly  our operating results in any period may vary significantly depending on changes in our customers financial condition or changes in our estimates of the uncollectible amounts of our receivables 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
our results of operations are reported as a single business segment 
the percentages may not add due to rounding 
as of december  consolidated statement of operations data revenues cost of revenues general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization non cash stock based compensation provision for doubtful accounts restructuring charges operating income loss interest expense interest income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of lower capital expenditures by several of our large telecommunications customers due to changing conditions in the telecommunications industry and to the filing for bankruptcy by a number of our telecommunications customers during as a result  we do not expect to continue to derive our historical levels of revenues from telecommunications customers 
during  we entered into an engineering  procurement and construction contract the epc contract with our largest customer  level communications  under which we recorded approximately million and million of revenues for and  respectively 
the epc contract was completed for all markets except new york and boston during  and is expected to be fully completed during  and accordingly  revenues from the epc contract will be lower in than in cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues represented of revenues in compared to of revenues in the increased percentage was due in part to fixed overhead costs which represented a higher percentage of a lower level of revenues  and in part to pricing pressure 
we anticipate that pricing pressure will continue during costs of approximately million and million were incurred in and  respectively  in connection with the epc contract 
general and administrative expenses 
our total general and administrative expenses were approximately the same in and expenses for salaries were higher in because of a higher average number of general and administrative personnel and rent expense was higher because of additional office premises occupied in mid and early  but those higher expenses were offset by a lower provision for incentive compensation in page depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in the increase reflects additional equipment acquired and leasehold improvements installed in newly occupied premises primarily in the last half of and the first quarter of non cash stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation declined to million in from million in  primarily because amortization in reflected up front vesting of options granted to certain executives in the first quarter of the decrease in was also due in part to the reversals of million of deferred stock based compensation for unvested options which were forfeited  and million with respect to an optionee whose status was changed from employee to consultant on april  the latter s unvested options were remeasured at their current fair value of million on april   which was charged to deferred compensation and is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period 
provision for doubtful accounts 
our provision for doubtful accounts increased to million in from million in the increase in was due to adverse developments in the financial condition of several of our customers during  primarily telecommunications carriers which experienced adverse changes in their financial condition during  and accordingly  we increased our estimates of the amount of receivables which will not be collectible from those customers 
restructuring charges 
in  we recorded million in restructuring charges  primarily in connection with the closing of seven offices and reduction in our workforce 
the restructuring charges are comprised primarily of million for obligations under leases for premises which the company has vacated  million for severance and related contractual obligations for approximately non unionized personnel and executives in areas being closed or scaled back  and million for writeoffs of property and equipment 
during the year we scaled back our expansion plans and closed a number of offices  and changed our business plans to focus primarily on our traditional markets  including the new york metropolitan region  washington dc  philadelphia and boston  among others 
we expect the implementation of our restructuring plan to reduce our pretax operating expenses by million in the year  of which million would represent cash savings 
these anticipated cash savings result primarily from reduced headcount  fewer vehicles  and sublease income from vacated premises 
total cash outlays under the restructuring program are expected to be approximately million  of which approximately million was paid during of the balance of million  severance and related contractual obligations of million are expected to be paid by the end of and obligations under leases of million are expected to be paid over the remaining terms of the leases up to nine years 
we expect to complete the restructuring plan by the end of interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a lower average level of debt outstanding in on august   we repaid the loan of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and during we repaid million of our subordinated note payable to a stockholder 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in from in interest income is earned on our interest bearing cash equivalents 
the increased income in was due to a higher average amount of cash equivalents  partially offset by lower prevailing interest rates 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was million of expense  comprised primarily of a writeoff of an investment in securities of million and costs of million related to a potential acquisition not consummated 
income tax provision benefits 
excluding tax benefits related to amortization of deferred stock based compensation  our effective tax rate in was approximately because a significant portion of our operations is concentrated in new york city  which subjects us to a local tax on income derived in that jurisdiction 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation relates to both incentive stock options and nonqualified options  however tax benefits are not available for incentive stock options 
therefore  tax benefits recorded in connection with amortization of deferred stock based compensation represent a lower effective rate compared with the effective rate for all other income loss 
as a result  our total effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was and for and  respectively 
page year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase in revenues was a result of expanded business from existing key customers  revenue generation from a growing customer base and expansion into new markets 
during  we entered into an engineering  procurement and construction contract with a customer  or the epc contract  under which we recorded approximately million and million of revenues for and  respectively 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase was due in part to increased technical personnel in support of additional demand from customers for our services  an increase in rent expense for additional premises and equipment  and an increase in our fleet of vehicles 
in addition  we expanded our operations into new geographic markets in  where we incurred costs for new supervisory and support personnel  tools and equipment  vehicles and leasehold improvements 
cost of revenues declined to of total revenues in from in the same period of  because the rate of increase in our revenues was higher than the rate of increase in our expenses 
costs of approximately million and million were incurred in and  respectively  in connection with the epc contract 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional compensation and related benefits for new executive and administrative personnel required to support our increased revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in the increase reflects the depreciation of additional equipment acquired during non cash stock based compensation 
we recorded amortization of non cash stock based compensation of million in  compared with million in  related to options and restricted stock granted at exercise prices determined by our board of directors at dates of grant to be equal to the fair value of the underlying stock  but with respect to which  for financial reporting purposes  the exercise or sales prices were subsequently determined to be lower than the deemed fair values of the underlying common stock at dates of grant 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was due to higher interest rates on our revolving line of credit and increases in equipment and capital lease obligations  offset by lower interest expense on subordinated notes payable because of a lower average level of such subordinated notes outstanding as a result of repayments of million during interest income 
interest income was million for the year  representing interest earned on our interest bearing cash equivalents acquired in august with the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
income tax provision benefits 
excluding the effect of amortization of deferred stock based compensation  our effective tax rate for was approximately because a significant portion of our operations is concentrated in new york city  which subjects us to a local tax on income derived in that jurisdiction 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation relates to both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options  however  tax benefits are not available for incentive stock options 
therefore  tax benefits recorded in connection with amortization of deferred stock based compensation represent a lower effective rate compared with the effective rate for all other income 
as a result  our total effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was and for the years and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and the net proceeds from our ipo 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
on august   we completed an ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and before expenses of the offering 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to pay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our page revolving credit facility 
we also used million of the net proceeds to pay dividends accrued after december  on redeemable convertible preferred stock which was converted to common stock upon consummation of our ipo  and million to repay subordinated notes payable to our two principal common stockholders 
the remaining net proceeds of the ipo  after expenses of the offering  were invested in interest bearing cash equivalents 
in june  we obtained a million revolving credit facility from two banks  which was subsequently increased to million in december  and to million in march in november  we completed a million bank credit facility with five banks  which was to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and potential acquisitions 
in august  we repaid the million loan outstanding under the credit facility  and in december we terminated the credit facility as we do not currently anticipate that borrowings under the credit facility would be required in order to meet our projected needs for liquidity for the foreseeable future 
cash used in operations is required primarily to carry accounts receivable and to fund projects in process and other working capital requirements 
to the extent that our customers suffer adverse developments in their financial condition  they may be unable to provide us with additional revenues and they also may be unable to repay some or all of our receivables  and as a result our cash receipts would be adversely impacted 
in  we recorded a provision for uncollectible receivables of million representing our estimate of the portion of our receivables which will be uncollectible because of adverse developments in the financial condition of several of our customers 
net cash provided by operations was million for  resulting from net collections of receivables offset by payments made for accounts payable and income taxes 
net cash used in operations was million in  and million in we invoice our customers for large projects on a monthly basis as work is performed and or when milestones are achieved 
unattained milestones would result in a delay in billing the customers  which would in turn result in a delay in cash receipts 
for certain projects  customers hold back a certain percentage usually until the project is completed 
as of december   these hold backs aggregated million 
if revenues increase in future years  we would likely be required to finance an increased level of working capital  primarily comprised of higher levels of accounts receivable and projects in process 
alternatively  to the extent we are not successful in replacing revenues previously derived from several of our large telecommunications carrier customers with other revenues from existing or new customers  our liquidity position would be adversely impacted if we are unable to reduce our costs at a rate commensurate with the reduction in revenues  and we could incur a net loss 
cash used in investing activities  primarily capital expenditures  was million for  million for  and million for net cash used in financing activities for was million  primarily for debt repayments 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  comprised of million in proceeds from our ipo and million proceeds from exercises of stock options and sales of restricted stock  offset by costs of the ipo of million  preferred dividends of million  and net debt repayments 
net cash provided from financing activities in was million  representing net borrowings 
we have no material commitments other than installment obligations related to equipment purchases  leases for facilities  computer equipment and vehicles  and a subordinated note payable to a stockholder 
we anticipate that available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our future working capital requirements and liquidity will depend upon many factors  including our customers financial condition and their ability to pay amounts owing to us  our ability to replace the revenues previously derived from several of our large telecommunications carrier customers with revenue from other customers  and our ability to reduce costs at a rate commensurate with any reduction in revenues which we are unable to replace with new revenues 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows page payments due by period and total beyond in thousands long term debt    capital leases  operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      on october  we received publicly traded shares of common stock of metromedia fiber network inc mfn with a value of million at that date  in partial settlement of a receivable 
as of december  the mfn common stock had a market value of million 
the mfn common stock is classified as an available for sale security and is included in current assets on our balance sheet 
realization of the recorded value of the mfn common stock depends on the market price on the date the shares are sold 
one half of such shares may be sold on or after january  and the other half may be sold on or after april  during january we sold half of such shares for total proceeds of million 
effects of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas business combinations and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  which are effective for us beginning january  sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
sfas provides that intangible assets with finite lives must be amortized over their estimated useful life  and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized but will be evaluated annually for impairment 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement defines the accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets and is effective for us on january  we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash equivalents are interest bearing investment grade securities  primarily short term  highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase of less than days 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in the market interest rates by basis points over the rates in effect on december  would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an insignificant amount 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
at december   we owned common shares of mfn with a market value of million 
the shares are traded on nasdaq  and we are subject to market price risk with respect to the shares 
during january we sold half of such shares for total proceeds of million 
we are restricted from selling the remaining shares until april  we currently do not have any international operations  and we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts or other financial instruments with respect to foreign currency 
accordingly  we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange rate risk
