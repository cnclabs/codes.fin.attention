item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview obie media is an out of home advertising company that markets advertising space primarily on transit vehicles and outdoor advertising displays billboards and wallscapes 
as of november   obie had exclusive agreements with transit districts in the united states and canada to operate transit advertising displays 
since obie s ipo in november  the number of vehicles on which we have the right to operate transit advertising displays has increased from approximately  to over  we also operate and generally own more than  advertising displays on billboards and walls primarily in washington  oregon  montana  wyoming  california and idaho 
obie s gross revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income declined from a million profit in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal ebitda declined from million in fiscal to negative million during this same period 
a substantial portion of our loss for fiscal results from our payment of minimum advertising revenues guaranteed to transit districts under our transit district contracts 
beginning in the latter half of fiscal management began to be increasingly concerned about these minimum revenue guarantees in the face of declining advertising revenues in some transportation districts 
accordingly  management began to seek to restructure or terminate certain of these arrangements in a way that would limit obie s exposure to these payments to an amount that would reflect a more appropriate sharing of revenues under our advertising contracts 
between august  and february   we have renegotiated of these contracts and were continuing to negotiate with transit agencies to restructure an additional contracts 
the renegotiated contracts have resulted in occupancy expense reduction of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal we anticipate additional savings for fiscal years through as we conclude negotiations on the additional contracts 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to eliminate or materially reduce this type of risk and  if not  we may experience further adverse impacts on our operating revenues  some or all of which may be material 
obie s operating results are affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
based on industry sources  in recent years outdoor advertising expenditures in the united states have increased more rapidly than total us advertising expenditures 
however  this trend may not continue and future outdoor advertising expenditures may grow more slowly than expenditures for the advertising industry as a whole 
moreover  our historical growth has primarily resulted from i growth in our transit advertising business  primarily resulting from new agreements with additional transit districts  ii the acquisition of p c on september   and iii the development and acquisition of new outdoor displays 
as a result of these factors  our operating performance is not necessarily comparable on a period to period basis 
we plan to continue expanding through both internal growth and acquisitions 
operating results the following table presents certain items from obie media s consolidated statements of income and ebitda as a percentage of gross revenues 
year ended november transit advertising revenue outdoor advertising revenue gross revenue less agency commissions net revenues operating expenses direct advertising expense general and administrative start up costs contract settlement provision for transit contract losses ebitda depreciation and amortization operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss comparison of years ended november  and revenues 
obie s gross revenues are derived from sales of advertising on out of home advertising displays  primarily on transit vehicles under transit district agreements and on outdoor advertising displays we own or operate 
gross revenues are a function of both the occupancy of these display spaces and the rates we can charge 
we focus our sales efforts on maximizing occupancy levels while maintaining rate integrity in our markets 
over the past several years  our transit advertising operations have expanded more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
gross revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million 
this increase was principally associated with the addition of new agreements with the transit districts of chicago  san antonio  tampa and indianapolis 
these increases were partially offset by a general decline in national and local advertising 
transit revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to these same factors 
outdoor advertising revenues increased approximately  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of revenues associated with price increases  improvements to existing billboards  and an acquisition of additional billboards in montana 
agency commissions increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  slightly less than the increase in gross revenues overall 
net revenues represent gross revenues less agency commissions 
consistent with standard industry practice  advertising agencies whose clients contract with obie typically retain of the gross advertising revenues from those accounts 
management believes obie s focus on direct sales to accounts not served by advertising agencies has resulted in our expenses for agency commissions as a percentage of our aggregate gross revenues being lower than the industry average 
customers represented by advertising agencies currently account for approximately of our gross revenues 
for the reasons discussed in the paragraph above  net revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during the fiscal year ended november  our revenues from transit advertising sales  as a percentage of gross revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal increases in gross revenues over the last two fiscal years are primarily the result of the increased number of transit vehicles and outdoor displays on which we market advertising space and  to a lesser extent  rate increases 
direct advertising expenses 
direct advertising expenses consist primarily of occupancy  production and installation  and sales costs 
occupancy expense primarily consists of two elements i payments to transit districts for the right to sell advertising displayed on their vehicles  and ii lease payments to owners of property on which our outdoor advertising structures are located 
under obie media s transit agreements  we typically guarantee to pay the transit district the greater of a minimum stated amount or a percentage of the advertising revenues generated by our use of the district s vehicles 
occupancy expense for outdoor structures includes the cost of illuminating outdoor displays and property taxes on the outdoor advertising structures 
sales expenses consist primarily of employment and administrative expenses associated with our sales force 
direct advertising expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased minimum transit fees associated with the new markets described above and the impact of large minimum transit fee payments as described in recent developments above 
direct advertising expenses increased  as a percentage of gross revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the growth of the transit advertising business where costs  especially occupancy costs  are higher as a percentage of revenue  than in the outdoor advertising business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs related to individual markets  as well as corporate expenses 
expenses related to individual markets include expenses for the personnel and facilities required to administer that market and neighboring markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent personnel and facilities costs for obie media s executive offices and centralized staff functions 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from increases in personnel and related costs associated with managing the growth of obie s transit business  including the addition of new districts  plus additions to reserves for doubtful accounts receivable 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of gross revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal start up costs 
start up costs are the costs obie incurs in pursuing new transit district agreements and the costs of establishing a sales force and office in a new market prior to beginning to operate under a new agreement 
these costs consist primarily of travel expenses  various personnel costs  legal fees and the costs of preparing proposals in response to transit district requests for proposals 
the amount of start up costs we incur in the future will vary  both in total amount and as a percentage of revenues  depending on the number and complexity of proposals for new districts and our success in obtaining new contracts 
start up costs for fiscal increased  from  in fiscal to  the increase during fiscal is a result of costs incurred to enter the new markets described above 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to capital expenditures for outdoor advertising displays as well as investment in computing and other equipment for the new markets described above 
provision for contract losses 
most transit arrangements include a provision that a certain percentage of net revenues be shared with the transit authorities transit fees on a revenue sharing basis a certain percentage to the transit authority  the balance retained by obie  but often with minimum payment requirements 
agreements that contain large minimum transit fee payment guarantees significantly hinder obie s ability to manage its operating expenses in weak economic environments 
these high minimum payment requirements have resulted in higher than acceptable direct advertising expense levels  and are primarily responsible for the operating losses reported for the year ended november  obie is continuing to negotiate modifications to certain of those contracts and believes it will be substantially successful in doing so see recent developments 
a million provision for transit contract losses  including a million accrual for transit fees  has been recorded for fiscal year operating income 
due to the events and factors discussed above  including the provision for transit contract losses  we experienced an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the increased use of the working capital credit line and additional long term borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
the loss before income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of million for fiscal  compared to a provision for income taxes of million during fiscal obie s beneficial tax rate was for fiscal the difference between the statutory united states federal income tax rate and the beneficial tax rate for fiscal is due primarily to a deferred tax valuation reserve for net operating loss carryforwards 
obie s effective tax rate for fiscal was  higher than the statutory rate due to provisions for foreign and state income taxes 
net income 
obie realized a net loss of million during fiscal  compared to net income of million in fiscal this difference arose primarily because of a declining media revenue environment resulting from shifting economic conditions  on the one hand  and the requirement to meet minimum guarantee payments to transit districts  on the other hand 
comparison of years ended november  and revenues 
gross revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was principally due to having a whole year s activities of transit contracts acquired in and increases in other previously acquired contracts 
transit revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the above factors 
outdoor advertising revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal agency commissions increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a general increase in overall business 
as a result of the foregoing reasons  net revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal direct advertising expenses 
direct advertising expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of activities required to support obie s increased level of business 
direct advertising expenses increased slightly  as a percentage of gross revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the growth of the transit advertising business  where costs  especially occupancy costs  are higher as a percentage of revenue than in the outdoor advertising business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from increased costs of administering new transit districts and districts which operated for less than all of fiscal general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of gross revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal contract settlement 
during  obie media recognized a non recurring pre tax gain of million associated with its contract settlement with tri met 
until june   obie had a contract to provide advertising sales services to the tri county metropolitan transit district tri met in portland  oregon which  by its terms  was scheduled to expire in june obie originally began servicing tri met in january pursuant to a five year agreement that was later extended for an additional two years 
the federal transit administration fta  which provides substantial monies to transit districts  has taken the position that transit advertising contracts may not exceed five years in length 
at the request of the fta  tri met and obie agreed that obie s then effective tri met agreement would terminate on june  in december  obie entered into an agreement with tri met whereby tri met agreed to compensate obie for terminating the existing contract early 
the total amount of the contract settlement was million  and that amount is included as an offset in operating expenses in obie s consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  management does not expect a recurrence of this one time revenue item 
see note to obie s consolidated financial statements 
start up costs 
start up costs decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the larger amounts were primarily due to obie s increased response to requests for proposal for transit district contracts  bidding on a greater number of large district contracts  and the costs incurred in retaining the portland contract 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to obie s investment in equipment in new markets  upgrading of computer capabilities and adding outdoor displays in existing operations and through acquisitions 
operating income 
due to the above factors  operating income decreased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from  in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the increased use of the working capital credit line and additional long term borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased  or  from million for fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes 
the effective rate of income taxes as compared to taxable income was in and in net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income decreased  or  from million for fiscal to million for recent developments management is currently seeking to restructure our business strategy regarding transit fee arrangements and guarantees with transit authorities 
most of our transit arrangements require us to share a certain percentage of our net transit fee revenues with the transit authorities a certain percentage to the transit authorities  the balance retained by obie 
many of these arrangements provide that we must guarantee a minimum payment to the transit district irrespective of our revenue levels 
agreements that contain large minimum transit fee payment guarantees significantly hamper our ability to manage operating expenses during weak economic and or advertising environments 
these high minimum payment requirements have resulted in higher than historical direct advertising expense levels as a percentage of revenues  and are primarily responsible for our operating losses during fiscal we are currently negotiating to modify these guaranteed minimum fee arrangements with many of our transit districts  and management believes we will be substantially successful in doing so 
in appropriate circumstances  where we cannot restructure our existing agreements we may seek to terminate our contracts with those districts 
in recognition of these issues  we recorded a million provision for transit contract losses  including a million accrual for renegotiated transit fees  for fiscal as february  contracts accounting for of gross transit revenues excluding million related to the chicago contract had been renegotiated  and contracts accounting for another were under negotiation 
in addition  contracts accounting for fiscal of gross transit revenues will expire in march and will be subject to a re bidding process 
on december   obie was notified by the chicago transit authority cta that the cta was unilaterally terminating their advertising contract  claiming that obie was in default of certain contractual provisions 
obie was originally awarded the contract in december to be the exclusive provider of advertising on cta s  buses   rapid transit cars  and rail stations 
management believes we were in material compliance with all aspects of the cta contract and that obie never received prior notice of default from the cta before termination  as required under the contract 
obie contends that a restructuring of the cta contract was appropriate because a a decline in national advertising and the attendant decline in cta advertising during made the arrangement less favorable than both parties had expected  and b cta made significantly less advertising space available to obie than cta had originally held out in the request for proposal it issued in the fall of we are vigorously seeking to redress cta s termination and are working closely with counsel to resolve the matter favorably 
however  there can be no assurances that the matter can be resolved in a manner acceptable to obie  and that should a resolution be unattainable  management plans to pursue its available legal remedies 
in the third quarter of fiscal obie reported a million provision for transit contract losses 
management believes that this loss accrual is sufficient to accommodate the resulting contract adjustments described above 
in february obie and us bank agreed on a new financing arrangement 
the arrangement includes a million term loan revolver and a million working capital revolver 
interest rates on each  at obie s option  are based upon a range of basis points above either the london inter bank offered rate libor or us bank s prime rate  the range to be determined based upon certain financial ratio standards 
obie used the term loan revolver to refinance all existing debt  including the then outstanding line of credit 
the term revolver does not require any principal payments until third quarter of fiscal as of november  we were not in compliance with our operating covenants in our existing credit facility that relate to certain financial ratios  and us bank had granted us a waiver of that noncompliance 
on february  us bank and obie agreed to a revised credit facility which included modified financial ratio covenants 
the revised agreement extends the term of the credit facility through february the credit facility requires the execution and delivery of definitive transaction documentation and obie s continuing compliance with the revised covenants 
in the second quarter of fiscal we acquired a second large format digital production printer for approximately  subsequent to november   we purchased a third large format digital production printer for approximately  these purchases complement existing equipment used to produce transit and outdoor advertising display content 
this additional capacity will allow us to produce a significant amount of product previously subcontracted to outside vendors 
resignation of director 
effective september   wayne p 
schur resigned as a director and officer of obie media corporation and its subsidiary  philbin coine  inc mr 
schur was the president and sole or principal shareholder of p c media from to prior to its acquisition by obie media 
seasonality historically  obie media s revenues and operating results have fluctuated by season 
typically  obie s results of operations are strongest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter of our fiscal year  which ends november obie s transit advertising operations are more seasonal than our outdoor advertising operations as the outdoor advertising display space  unlike our transit advertising display space  is and has been sold nearly exclusively by means of month contracts 
management believes the seasonality of our revenues and operating results will increase if transit advertising operations continue to expand more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
this seasonality  together with fluctuations in general and regional economic conditions and the timing and expenses related to acquisitions  securing new transit agreements and other actions we have taken and plan to continue to take to implement our growth strategy  have contributed to fluctuations in our periodic operating results 
these fluctuations likely will continue 
accordingly  results of operations in any period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources obie media has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and revolving credit borrowings 
obie s working capital at november  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the recording of a million accrual for transit contract losses and an increase in the utilization of our working capital credit line to fund operations 
acquisitions and capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of new outdoor advertising displays  digital printing equipment and technology related assets  have been financed primarily with borrowed funds 
obie media s net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  in fiscal the change between periods was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and refundable income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from our using approximately million in for direct billboard acquisitions compared to significantly smaller acquisitions in capital expenditures totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures consist primarily of the cost of building and acquiring outdoor advertising displays  and in included the cost of the digital printing equipment described above 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of borrowings used to finance increases in accounts receivable associated with sales in the transit markets added during the year 
effective february  obie entered into a new financing arrangement with us bank 
the new arrangement provides for a million term line maturing in august of  and a million working capital line of credit available for general purposes 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of obie and its subsidiaries 
obie used the term revolver to refinance all its then existing debt  including the previously outstanding line of credit 
the term revolver does not require any principal payments until third quarter of fiscal at november   available borrowing capacity under the line of credit  based on collateralized accounts  was million 
as of november  we were not in compliance with our operating covenants in our existing credit facility that relate to certain financial ratios  and us bank has granted us a waiver of that non compliance 
on february  us bank and obie agreed to a revised credit facility which included modified financial ratio covenants 
the revised agreement extends the term of the credit facility through february the credit facility requires the execution and delivery of definitive transaction documentation and obie s continued compliance with the revised covenants 
management can provide no assurances that us bank will continue to renew our credit arrangements as they expire 
see recent developments above 
at november  obie media had outstanding borrowings of million  of which million was pursuant to a long term credit agreement and  was pursuant to the agreement to acquire p c 
we expect to continue pursuing a policy of measured growth through obtaining new transit district agreements  acquiring out of home advertising companies or assets and constructing new outdoor advertising displays 
we intend to finance our future expansion activities using a combination of internal and external sources 
management believes that internally generated funds and funds available for borrowing under obie s bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy all debt service obligations  to finance existing operations  including anticipated capital expenditures but excluding possible acquisitions  through fiscal  and to fund transit contract loss accrual payments 
future acquisitions by obie media  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
market risk we may be exposed to future interest rate changes on our debt 
management does not believe that a hypothetical per cent change in end of period interest rates would have a material effect on obie s cash flow 
the effect of new accounting pronouncements 
in june the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards n  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 
sfas 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards n accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas and establish accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas and are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  obie adopted sfas and for its fiscal year beginning december  obie does not currently have any derivative instruments nor does it participate in hedging activities  and therefore the adoption of these standards did not have any impact on its financial statements or results of operations 
on june   the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  obie will adopt sfas effective december  as of december   obie had net unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
management expects amortization expense to be approximately  in fiscal sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete this first step 
obie expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of the year ending november  fiscal year 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year the company has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the company s earnings and financial position
