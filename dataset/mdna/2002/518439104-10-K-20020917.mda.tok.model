item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgements can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and derivatives 
revenue recognition generally  revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns 
as is customary in the cosmetics industry  our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for approximately billion  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our accounts receivable at june  these groups sell products primarily within north america 
although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows  and or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products  promotional products  raw materials and componentry that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan  an unfunded  nonqualified domestic benefit pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations  a contributory defined contribution plan  international pension plans  which vary by country  the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans  deferred compensation  and certain other postretirement benefits 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
for fiscal  we will use a pre retirement discount rate of and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of  both of which will result in a higher calculated pension expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
on an annual basis  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  we evaluated our recorded goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
income taxes we have accounted for  and currently account for  income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of million and non current net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of current tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately million for deferred tax assets  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
furthermore  the company provides tax reserves for federal  state and international exposures relating to audit results  planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities 
the development of these reserves requires judgements about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate 
derivatives we currently account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedge effectiveness is documented  assessed and monitored by our employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments 
variables that are external to the company such as social  political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereon 
results of operations we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
the following is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
sales of products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
the unusual events that occurred during the current fiscal year and their effect on the economy  particularly in the united states  have adversely impacted our business 
in addition  the decline in worldwide travel during most of fiscal led to a reduction in our travel retail sales 
sales growth from certain newer brands and recently launched products partially offset these decreases 
the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the restructurings in fiscal and fiscal neither restructuring was material to our net sales  and the discussions represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
for a discussion of the restructurings  see operating expenses restructuring and other non recurring expenses in this section and under the same heading under fiscal as compared with fiscal 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to billion 
the net sales increase is primarily attributable to recently launched products such as total turnaround visible skin renewer  advanced night repair eye recovery complex  moisture surge extra and moisture surge eye gel  a perfect world  lightsource transforming moisture lotion and cream  and re nutriv ultimate lifting creme 
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as turnaround cream and resilience lift  as well as products in clinique s step skin care system 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to billion 
newer brands such as mac  bobbi brown and stila  which are primarily makeup products  contributed through growth at existing doors and increased distribution 
in addition  strong sales of the pure color line of products  the worldwide launch of gentle light makeup and illusionist mascara contributed positively to net sales growth 
partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower sales of two in one eye shadow  lucidity makeup  and long last soft shine lipstick 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products decreased or million to billion 
this category continued to be impacted by the softness of the fragrance business in the united states and the decline in our travel retail business  which depends substantially on fragrance products 
lower net sales of beautiful  estee lauder pleasures  dkny for women and certain existing tommy hilfiger licensed products were partially offset by the recent launch of t  a new fragrance in the tommy hilfiger line  and intuition for men  as well as strong sales of donna karan cashmere mist 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of growth from aveda  which benefited from recently launched texture lotion products and color conserve shampoo and an increase in the number of company owned aveda environmental lifestyle stores 
sales of bumble and bumble products increased due to an expanded product line and an increase in the number of points of sale 
the results were partially offset by lower sales from clinique s simple hair care system when compared with the prior year launch 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to billion 
the increase is primarily due to the success of most newer brands  partially offset by economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states during most of the fiscal year 
we expect uncertain economic conditions to persist into fiscal and we are planning accordingly 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to billion 
this increase was primarily the result of higher net sales in the united kingdom  spain and greece  where in fiscal we formed a joint venture in which we own a controlling majority interest with our former distributor 
the increase was partially offset by lower net sales in our travel retail business  which has been adversely affected by a decrease in worldwide travel 
excluding the impact of our travel retail business  net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased or million 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million primarily due to higher net sales in korea and thailand  as well as in australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements 
the increased sales were partially offset by lower net sales in japan 
japan continues to remain a difficult market due to local economic conditions and increasing competition 
the challenges were made more difficult by the weakness of the japanese yen during fiscal as compared with the us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific net sales increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was as compared with in the prior year 
the lower margin can be attributed in part to production volume decreases resulting in under absorption of overhead  as well as lower than planned raw material purchases that reduced anticipated savings from sourcing initiatives 
partially offsetting these negative factors were lower sales volumes of products with a higher cost of goods  particularly in travel retail and fragrance 
due to variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions  we anticipate greater fluctuations in our gross margins and operating expenses on a period by period basis 
operating expenses operating expenses operating expenses increased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses primarily related to restructuring expenses  continued advertising and promotional spending and the cost to expand and operate our retail stores 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects a slower growth rate in sales than operating expenses  primarily due to economic conditions in the united states as discussed above 
as part of our long term strategies  we continued to emphasize the building of brand equities through advertising and promotional spending and retail store expansion despite difficult economic times 
changes in advertising and promotional spending result from the type  timing and level of advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
excluding the impact of restructuring and other non recurring expenses  operating expenses were and of net sales for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
restructuring and other non recurring expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges for a restructuring related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability 
the restructuring focused on cost reduction opportunities related to the internet  our supply chain  globalization of the organization and distribution channel refinements 
we have committed to a defined plan of action  which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of million  of which million is cash related 
on an after tax basis  the aggregate charge was million  equal to 
per diluted share 
as these initiatives are fully implemented  we expect to generate annual ongoing savings of about million  of which a portion will be reinvested 
specifically  the charge included the following o internet 
in an effort to achieve strategic objectives  reduce costs and improve profitability  we outsourced gloss 
com platform development and maintenance efforts to a third party provider 
additionally  gloss 
com closed its san francisco facility and consolidated its operations in new york 
as a result  included in the charge was a million provision for restructuring the gloss 
com operations  including benefits and severance packages for employees as well as asset write offs 
we also took a million charge to write off the related gloss 
com acquisition goodwill 
o supply chain 
building on previously announced supply chain initiatives  we have restructured certain manufacturing  distribution  research and development  information systems and quality assurance operations in the united states  canada and europe  which included benefits and severance packages for employees 
a charge of million was recorded related to this effort 
o globalization of organization 
we continue to implement our previously announced transition to a global brand structure designed to streamline the decision making process and increase innovation and speed to market 
the next phase of this transition entailed eliminating duplicate functions and responsibilities  which resulted in charges for benefits and severance for employees 
we recorded a charge of million associated with these efforts 
o distribution 
we evaluated areas of distribution relative to our financial targets and will focus our resources on the most productive sales channels and markets 
as a result  we closed our operations in argentina and the remaining customers will be serviced by our chilean affiliate 
we are also closing all remaining in store tommy s shops and we are closing other select points of distribution 
we recorded a million provision related to these actions  which included benefits and severance for employees 
following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal restructuring in millions net cost of operating sales sales expenses total internet supply chain globalization of organization distribution total charge tax effect net charge the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or  where applicable  as a reduction of the related asset 
during fiscal  million related to this restructuring was paid and approximately million of additional payments were made through august  we expect to settle a majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal with certain additional payments made ratably through fiscal operating results operating income decreased or million to million as compared with the prior year 
operating margins were of net sales in the current period as compared with in the prior year 
the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to restructuring expenses  lower than expected sales levels  increased support spending and new distribution channel costs 
this was partially offset by the exclusion of amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in fiscal and the november expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights 
operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and other non recurring expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
before consideration of the restructuring and other non recurring expenses  operating income decreased to million and operating margins were in fiscal as compared with in fiscal net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings declined million to million and net earnings per diluted share was lower by 
per diluted share from to 
on a comparable basis  before restructuring and other non recurring expenses  before the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle  and excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal  net earnings were million  representing a decrease of over the prior year  and diluted earnings per common share decreased to from in the prior year 
the following discussions of operating income by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and other non recurring expenses and represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
product categories operating income decreased to million in fragrance  to million in makeup and to million in skin care  primarily due to lower than anticipated sales levels  coupled with continued advertising and promotional spending to promote new and recently launched products 
hair care operating income increased  from a smaller base  to million  primarily due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble 
geographic regions operating income in the americas decreased or million to million  primarily due to lower sales attributable to weakness in the us economy and continued advertising and promotional spending 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income decreased or million to million  primarily due to the significant decrease in our travel retail business 
partially offsetting the decrease were improved operating results in italy  the united kingdom  spain and germany 
we also benefited from the inclusion of operating results from our majority owned joint venture in greece 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased slightly to million due to lower income in china and hong kong offset by higher results in korea  in australia  where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements  and in japan  where we were able to reduce operating expenses 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease in net interest expense resulted from a lower effective interest rate compared with the prior year 
this was primarily due to our interest rate risk management strategy that relied on commercial paper and variable rate term loans 
in january  we took advantage of prevailing market rates and issued fixed rate long term notes to replace our variable rate debt 
we believe this will mitigate future interest rate volatility  but we expect it will result in a higher level of interest expense in the near term 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including  but not limited to  the geographical mix of earnings  the timing and amount of foreign dividends  state and local taxes  tax audit settlements and interaction of various global tax strategies 
the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared with in the prior year 
these rates reflect the effect of state and local taxes  changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  tax credits and certain non deductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives  as well as a decrease in non deductible domestic royalty expense and the elimination of certain non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to billion reflecting continued growth in the makeup  skin care and hair care categories  partially offset by a decline in fragrance net sales 
the united states retail business demonstrated continued softness particularly in the fragrance category 
growth on a reported basis reflected the impact of a stronger us dollar relative to other currencies in virtually all markets in which we do business 
net sales growth was primarily attributable to a combination of new and recently launched products  the inclusion of newer brands such as bumble and bumble and changes in distribution  including additional retail locations 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased  with double digit contributions from each of europe  the middle east africa and asia pacific 
the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal restructuring and other non recurring expenses  which were not material to our net sales  and represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
for a discussion of the restructuring and other non recurring expenses  see operating expenses restructuring and other non recurring expenses in this section 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to billion 
this increase was primarily attributable to newer products such as idealist skin refinisher  anti gravity firming lift cream  anti gravity firming eye lift cream and pro preferred skincare products  the first skin care line for our mac brand 
by introducing new products into lines such as re nutriv  the origins ginger bath and body collection and acne solutions  we continued to attract consumers to the lines and maintain sales momentum 
white light brightening system and active white continued to be popular whitening products particularly in the asia pacific region 
newly launched products such as private spa collection  origins facial skin products and initial shipments of lightsource contributed to increased sales 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain existing products such as fruition extra and diminish 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to billion 
significant contributors were recently launched products such as high impact eye shadow  moisture surge lipstick  equalizer smart makeup  lash doubling mascara  glossware  pure color lip gloss  luxe makeup and automatic pencil duo 
in addition  established products such as pure color lipstick  quickliner for lips  quickliner for eyes and sheer powder blusher added to increased sales 
mac products also contributed to increased sales with the eden rocks  mac paints and heat product lines 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products decreased or million to billion  but increased on a comparable currency basis 
the decrease in net sales was attributable to a continued decline in sales of tommy hilfiger licensed products  as well as to lower sales of estee lauder pleasures  clinique happy and clinique happy for men 
the continued softness of the fragrance business in the united states in fiscal and difficult comparisons to the prior year contributed to the decline in this category 
contributing positively to the category were new products  such as intuition  ginger essence and dkny for men  as well as the international rollout of dkny for women 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
the increase in sales is attributable to the inclusion of bumble and bumble  in which we acquired a controlling majority equity interest in june  and the launch of clinique s simple hair care system 
in addition  sales growth was generated by aveda shampoo and conditioner products  such as the sap moss and brilliant product groups  and an increase in the number of company owned aveda environmental lifestyle stores 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions sales in the americas increased or million to billion 
this increase was driven by sales growth in the makeup  skin care  and hair care categories  particularly with the success of new and recently launched products and the growth of our newer brands 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in fragrance sales due to the softness in this category in the united states 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to billion 
the increase was primarily the result of higher net sales in the united kingdom  spain and france and in our distributor and travel retail businesses 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales in germany and south africa 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million primarily due to higher net sales in korea  hong kong  malaysia and thailand  partially offset by lower sales in japan and australia 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales grew in each country in europe  the middle east africa and in asia pacific  accounting for growth of and  respectively 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to from  reflecting the impact of our manufacturing and sourcing initiatives as well as changes in distribution and product mix 
changes in distribution include the rollout of our own retail stores and the acquisition of certain distributor operations  both of which contributed to higher gross margins 
in addition  the synergies achieved by incorporating recently acquired businesses into our existing manufacturing and sourcing infrastructures had a favorable impact on gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses operating expenses increased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
excluding the impact of restructuring and other non recurring expenses  operating expenses were of net sales 
this change primarily related to the increased cost of our retail store and internet operations  which have higher operating cost structures than our traditional distribution channels 
additionally  depreciation and amortization charges increased compared with the prior year  reflecting increased goodwill amortization from acquisitions and depreciation related to capital investments  partially offset by the november expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights 
changes in advertising and promotional spending result from the type  timing and level of advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as from the markets being emphasized 
restructuring and other non recurring expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded one time charges for restructuring and other non recurring expenses related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability 
the restructuring and other non recurring expenses focused on four areas product fixtures for the jane brand  in store tommy s shops  information systems and other assets  and global brand reorganization 
we committed to a defined plan of action  which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of million  of which million is cash related 
on an after tax basis  the aggregate charge was million  equal to 
per diluted share 
specifically  the charge included the following o jane 
to bring product innovation rapidly to the market and drive growth  jane switched from its traditional wall displays to a carded program 
we believed this change would lead to increased sales and improvements in profitability 
the positive effects on sales and improved profitability of this initiative were offset by the reduction in the number of points of sale during fiscal the charge included a million write down of existing jane product fixtures and the return of uncarded product from virtually all of the  distribution outlets in the united states 
o tommy s shops 
we also restructured the in store tommy s shops to focus on our most productive locations and decided to close certain shops that underperformed relative to expectations 
as a result  we recorded a million provision for the closing of under performing in store tommy s shops  located in the united states  and for related product returns 
o information systems and other assets 
in response to changing technology and our new strategic direction  the charge included a million provision for costs associated with the reevaluation of supply chain systems that we will no longer utilize and with the elimination of unproductive assets related to the change to standard financial systems 
o global brand reorganization 
we recorded million related to benefits and severance packages for management employees who were affected by the reconfiguration to a global brand structure and another million related to infrastructure costs 
as of june   none of the management employees identified in the reorganization was still an employee 
we believe that the global brand structure is improving decision making processes  thereby increasing innovation and speed to market 
following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal restructuring other non in millions net cost of operating recurring sales sales expenses expenses total jane tommy s shops information systems and other assets global brand reorganization 
total charge tax effect net charge the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or as a reduction of fixed assets 
during fiscal  million was paid and through june   an additional million was paid 
as of june   the remaining obligation was million  the majority of which we expect to settle by the end of fiscal with remaining payments made ratably through fiscal operating results operating income decreased or million to million as compared with the prior year 
operating margins were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in the prior year 
operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and other non recurring expenses of million and million  respectively 
before consideration of these one time charges  operating income increased to million and operating margins were 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher net sales and an improved gross margin percentage  partially offset by increased operating expenses reflecting increased sales support spending and new distribution channel costs 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 
net earnings declined million to million and net earnings per diluted share was lower by 
per diluted share from to 
net earnings before restructuring and other non recurring expenses and before the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle was million  representing an increase of over the prior year  diluted earnings per common share increased to from in the prior year 
the following discussions of operating income by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and other non recurring expenses and represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
product categories operating income increased to million and to million in makeup and skin care  respectively  due primarily to the strength of recently launched products 
the strong growth of our mac business  which includes retail store expansion  also contributed to the increase in makeup operating income 
operating income from our fragrance business declined by million reflecting lower sales and increased support spending versus the prior year 
the nominal increase in hair care operating income was a result of the inclusion of bumble and bumble and sales from recent launches  partially offset by costs associated with refining aveda s salon distribution  opening new aveda environmental lifestyle stores and investing in new product introductions 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million as compared with the prior year  primarily due to net sales increases related to new and recently launched products  strong growth in our mac business and the inclusion of bumble and bumble  partially offset by a decline in fragrance net sales 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to improved operating results in the united kingdom and spain and in the travel retail business  partially offset by lower operating income in south africa 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased slightly to million due to higher results in korea and hong kong offset by lower operating income in japan and australia 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
as a result of an increase in average available cash during the period  we had higher interest income on invested funds and lower interest expense due to reduced short term borrowings 
additionally  we benefited from a lower effective interest rate on our long term borrowings resulting from our interest rate risk management strategy 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared with in the prior year 
these rates reflect the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain non deductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
in february  we repaid million principal amount of bank borrowings with proceeds of a public offering of senior notes due senior notes 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  we have a million commercial paper program  under which we have issued  and intend to issue  commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a by standard poor s and a by moody s 
at june   our outstanding borrowings consisted of million of commercial paper  million  net of million unamortized debt discount  of senior notes due january  a million yen loan payable approximately million at current exchange rates  which is due in april  and a billion yen term loan approximately million at current exchange rates  which is due in march commercial paper is classified as long term debt on our balance sheet based upon our intent and ability to refinance maturing commercial paper on a long term basis 
it is our policy to maintain backup facilities to support our commercial paper program and its classification as long term debt 
as of june   we had an unused million revolving credit facility  expiring on june  we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to million in debt securities 
in january  we issued and sold million of senior notes due in a public offering 
the senior notes were priced at with a yield of 
interest payments are required to be made semi annually on january and july of each year 
we made the first payment on july  the primary portion of the net proceeds of the offering was used to repay a million term loan 
the remainder was used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper 
we issued these fixed rate notes in an attempt to mitigate future interest rate volatility and capitalize on the prevailing market interest rates then available for such long term instruments 
however  we do expect the refinancing to result in a higher level of interest expense in the near term 
our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
to meet these needs  we could issue up to an additional million of commercial paper under our program  issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of june   we also had million in unused uncommitted facilities 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  as compared with at june   primarily as a result of higher total capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal this improvement in net cash flows was generated primarily by a reduction of inventory 
inventory levels were unseasonably high at the end of fiscal and were lowered during the current fiscal year as part of our ongoing effort to keep inventory levels in line with forecasted sales 
operating cash flows were generally not impacted by the fiscal restructuring as lower net earnings were offset by the non cash portion of the charge and the increase in other accrued liabilities 
we expect the settlement of these accrued charges to result in a lower level of cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected an increase in inventory primarily due to accelerated growth both in new distribution channels and in the rollout of new brands  a shift in the timing of christmas production at the end of fiscal as compared with the prior year  reconfiguration of some of our distribution to improve service levels  and softer retail sales than projected in the americas 
accounts receivable increased due to sales growth  particularly outside the united states  and the timing of shipments as compared with fiscal the decrease in other accrued liabilities in fiscal reflected the type and timing of various expenditures and the tightening of spending  particularly in the americas  due to the difficult retail environment  partially offset by a million accrual for restructuring and other non recurring expenses 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal is comparable to fiscal and relates primarily to capital expenditures in both periods 
investment spending in fiscal reflected capital expenditures and the acquisitions of stila  jo malone  gloss 
com and bumble and bumble  as well as certain aveda distributors 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements 
cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used for financing during fiscal and primarily relates to dividend payments and common stock repurchases 
the cash used in fiscal was primarily related to dividend payments 
in september  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program 
we have purchased  and may continue to purchase  over an unspecified period of time  a total of up to eight million shares of class a common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares for million 
as of june   we have purchased approximately million shares under this program 
subsequent to year end  we purchased an additional million shares for million bringing the cumulative total of acquired shares to million 
the board of directors declared  and we paid  quarterly dividends on our class a common stock and class b common stock at the rate of 
per share in each quarter of fiscal  and in fiscal  and  dividends declared on our common stock totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in may  we announced that  after declaring the 
per share quarterly dividend paid on july   the board of directors determined that it would pay future cash dividends on its common stock annually rather than quarterly 
we expect that the board of directors will declare the first annual dividend of 
per share in the second quarter of fiscal  so it will be payable in january accordingly  we expect total dividends paid on the common stock in fiscal to amount to 
per share 
total dividends declared  including dividends on the cumulative redeemable preferred stock  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we will be required to redeem the outstanding cumulative redeemable preferred stock on june  however  in the event that mrs 
estee lauder were to pass away before such date  then we would have the right to redeem the shares from the current holders  and the holders of such shares would have the right to put the shares to us  at per share or an aggregate of million 
if shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock are put to us  we would have up to days after notice to purchase such shares 
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
derivative financial instruments we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
for each derivative contract we enter into  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective  then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of june   these cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results 
the contracts have varying maturities through the end of july costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of million 
the foreign currencies included in these contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese yen million  euro million  british pound million  australian dollar million  swiss franc million  danish krone million and canadian dollar million 
interest rate risk management in february  we paid off our outstanding term loan  which had a floating interest rate  with the proceeds from our january public debt offering of senior notes 
as a result  we terminated the interest rate swaps and options that were previously outstanding to mitigate interest rate volatility 
no material gain or loss resulted from the termination of those contracts 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk  calculated as an average  for the twelve months ended june   related to our foreign exchange contracts  using a variance co variance model with a percent confidence level and assuming normal market conditions  was million 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in the portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
accounting standards effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements established financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets  including purchased goodwill  must be evaluated for impairment 
those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed our transitional impairment testing of intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal that effort  and preliminary assessments of our identifiable intangible assets  indicated that little or no adjustment would be required upon adoption of this pronouncement 
the impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we finalized the testing of goodwill 
using conservative  but realistic assumptions to model our jane business  we determined that the carrying value of this unit was slightly greater than the derived fair value  indicating an impairment in the recorded goodwill 
to determine fair value  we relied on three valuation models guideline public companies  acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow 
for goodwill valuation purposes only  the revised fair value of this unit was allocated to the assets and liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an implied fair value of goodwill  based upon known facts and circumstances  as if the acquisition occurred currently 
this allocation resulted in a write down of recorded goodwill in the amount of million  which has been reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as of july   in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
on a product category basis  this write down would have primarily impacted our makeup category
