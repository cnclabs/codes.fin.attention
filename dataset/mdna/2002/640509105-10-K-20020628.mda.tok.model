the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview neon develops  markets and supports software products that allow our customers to more efficiently use and manage the data housed on their mainframe computer systems 
neon was incorporated in may and is a successor by merger to neon systems  inc  an illinois corporation  which was incorporated in june neon derives revenue from software licenses and maintenance services 
historically  neon s shadow product line has generated substantially all of neon s revenue 
license fees  which are based upon the number and capacity of servers as well as the number of client users  are generally due upon license grant and include a one year maintenance period 
the sales process typically takes approximately nine months 
after the initial year of license  neon provides ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee 
in fiscal   and  maintenance revenues represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
maintenance revenues are expected to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues as neon s customer base continues to grow 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of  our products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
since neon s inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and technical support departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden our technical support and improve our operational and financial systems 
accordingly  we will need to increase our annual revenue to generate operating profits 
there can be no assurance in future quarters that we will achieve or sustain revenue growth and or return to profitability 
as a result  management believes that its cash resources may decline as a result of continuing losses from operations  the advance royalty payments made to pbtc and incremental costs associated with the acquisition and operation of scalable software 
see related party transactions below and in note to neon s financial statements 
neon conducts its business in the united kingdom and germany through two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries 
revenues from these subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
in connection with these foreign operations  neon is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations for its net working capital positions 
at march   neon had unhedged net current liabilities of  british pounds and unhedged net current assets of  euros 
at that date  neon had no material commitments that would be satisfied in currencies other than us dollars 
in other international markets  neon conducts substantially all of its business through independent third party distributors 
revenues derived from third party distributors are denominated in us dollars 
revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in europe  represented approximately  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on neon s revenues or operating results 
management does not currently have an active foreign exchange hedging program  however  neon may implement a program to mitigate foreign currency transaction risk in the future 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and the current weakness in the mainframe software market  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
further  we do not believe that historical growth rates are necessarily representative of our future growth potential 
related party transactions members of neon s board of directors and certain executive officers of neon are shareholders and or directors in other companies with which neon has business relationships 
see risk factors some members of our board of directors and management may have conflicts of interest and or are interested parties to certain transactions of neon 
transactions between neon and these other companies are described below 
peregrine bridge transfer corporation distribution agreement 
neon entered into a distribution agreement with peregrine bridge transfer corporation pbtc  a database software company  in january in december  neon amended its distribution agreement with peregrine bridge transfer corporation under which pbtc granted neon an exclusive  worldwide license to market and sublicense pbtc s only products  its enterprise subsystem management products 
the amended distribution agreement has an initial term through march  the agreement also provides that neon pay royalties for the license of products and for maintenance and support and upgrade services equal to of the revenues received by neon 
the terms of this agreement provide that neon will pay pbtc a minimum advance royalty of  per quarter during fiscal year   per quarter during fiscal year   per quarter during fiscal year   per quarter during fiscal year and  per quarter during fiscal year  for an aggregate payment of million 
this royalty payment is recorded as a prepaid expense and offset by of neon s sales of pbtc products 
neon incurred royalty expense of  and  for the twelve months ended march  and  respectively to pbtc 
the amended distribution agreement also provides that pbtc will reimburse neon for the amount of unearned royalty advances when the agreement terminates in the balance of the unearned advance payments was million at march   and increased to approximately million subsequent to year end 
management believes that while the current and reasonably foreseeable business prospects for revenue received by neon from licenses and maintenance for pbtc products are expected to be sufficient to offset the unearned advance payments as of march   these revenues may not be sufficient to meet the aggregate future minimum royalties to be paid by neon to pbtc 
as a result  the balance of unearned advance payments may increase substantially by the time the agreement terminates 
pbtc s sole source of income is the royalty payments made by neon and pbtc has a substantial negative net worth 
as a result  pbtc may be unable to repay any unearned advances at the termination of the agreement in services agreement 
neon also has a services agreement with pbtc pursuant to which pbtc reimburses neon for pbtc s share of the general and administrative expenses supplied to it by neon 
such amounts are presented as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company revised the services agreement with pbtc in october  as a result of which pbtc s monthly payment to neon declined from  per month to  per month and neon s services were substantially reduced

louis r 
woodhill  neon s president and ceo  is also a shareholder  director  president and ceo of scalable software 
in connection with the letter of intent  neon and scalable software entered into a promissory note dated july   which provided bridge financing to scalable in a maximum amount of million with a maturity date of december   secured by the personal guarantees of john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill 
on november   the promissory note was amended to increase the maximum lending limit to million with an original maturity date of march   with such increased amount also being guaranteed by messrs 
moores  woodhill and woodhill 
due to the interests in scalable software by several members of neon s board of directors  the board of directors concluded that it would be appropriate to create a special committee comprised solely of directors who had no interest in scalable software to review the terms of the proposed acquisition 
after thorough consideration and discussion by the special committee and its advisors  the special committee proposed that the payment of the consideration for the proposed acquisition be structured as an earn out  in which the neon stock to be used as consideration would be placed in escrow subject to release to the scalable software shareholders upon scalable software s attainment of specified revenue and profitability goals 
this proposal was unacceptable to scalable software s management and board of directors and was rejected 
the status of the proposed acquisition was then discussed at a special meeting of neon s board of directors in december after thorough consideration and discussion and upon endorsement by the special committee  neon s board of directors approved modifications to the proposed terms and conditions for the acquisition such that the transaction would be structured as an option to acquire scalable software as discussed below 
in addition  neon also announced on december   that louis r 
woodhill  its president and chief executive officer  and jim woodhill had been appointed to the board of directors of neon 
louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill were both directors and shareholders of scalable software and louis r 
woodhill was also the president and chief executive officer of scalable software 
as of june  their status as shareholders  directors and as officers of scalable software remains unchanged 
neon has obtained a two year option to acquire scalable software as outlined in the agreement and plan of merger dated june  in connection with this option  neon agreed to provide bridge financing of up to million  in addition to the million previously loaned to scalable software that is secured by personal guarantees from john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill 
the aggregate financing has a month term and will not bear interest during the term of the two year option to acquire scalable software 
after the expiration of the option  the loan will bear interest at the prime rate plus two percentage points 
in addition to the personal guarantees of john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill for the initial million loaned to scalable software  the million loan will be secured by all of the intellectual property rights of scalable software 
neon may exercise the option to acquire scalable software at any time during the two year term  subject to provisions that require neon to exercise its option within a day window under certain circumstances or forfeit the option 
if neon exercises the option and acquires scalable software  each of the approximately  outstanding shares of common stock of scalable software will be converted into approximately of a share of neon common stock and outstanding options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock of scalable software will become options and warrants to purchase common stock of neon on the same conversion basis 
if scalable software incurs more indebtedness for borrowed money or issues more equity  the exchange ratio will be reduced 
prior to neon exercising the option to acquire scalable software  a special committee would be appointed to review the negotiated terms of the proposed acquisition and neon would seek to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the transaction from a financial advisory firm 
the acquisition of scalable software will also require approval of the stockholders of neon and the neon board of directors 
management believes that the scalable software products are gaining increasing levels of acceptance in the marketplace and a reputation for ease of installation and use 
management further believes that the long term prospects for the products are excellent 
however  management also believes that scalable software will exhaust its line of credit from neon before it is able to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain its operations 
in that event  and if scalable software is unable to secure additional financing  it could become the subject of bankruptcy proceedings 
if scalable software is subject to bankruptcy proceedings  it is possible that the security interests held by neon in the intellectual property of scalable software could be set aside  and in such event neon would be an unsecured creditor with respect to its million loan to scalable software 
as noted above  certain members of neon s board of directors and executive officers also serve as directors and executive officers of scalable software and claim beneficial ownership of approximately of scalable s common stock 
in addition  neon has an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of scalable software and is currently providing scalable s primary financing for its operations 
therefore  neon recognizes of scalable software s losses to the extent of advances made in excess of the guaranteed amount 
at march   neon had made total advances of million to scalable software including million of unguaranteed advances and recognized an associated loss of million 
sheer genius software  inc on january   neon entered into a development services agreement with sheer genius software  inc of austin  texas  a company owned by jim woodhill 
also  jmi services  inc  a private company owned by john j 
moores  neon s chairman  is a creditor of sheer genius  holding a promissory note dated august  in the amount of  under the first project description negotiated for such development services agreement  sheer genius will provide development services to neon on a budgeted time and materials basis and will deliver fixed deliverables  consisting primarily of developed source code 
the term of the initial project description was six months and the maximum aggregate fees were  this agreement was recently amended to extend the contract period for an additional three months with additional maximum aggregate fees of  while neon is currently sheer genius software s sole source of income  it is free to solicit other customers 
under the services agreement  all intellectual property created by sheer genius in the course of performing the services shall be owned by neon 
additionally  sheer genius will receive a license back of such intellectual property for limited use in the development by sheer genius of software that does not compete with software distributed by neon 
the board of directors reviewed the terms of the services agreement and project description and approved such agreements following disclosure of the interest of its officers and directors associated with sheer genius 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition policies statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued in october by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and was amended by statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
neon adopted sop effective july   sop effective march  and sop effective april  neon believes its current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with sop  sop and sop revenues from software license sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the receivable is probable  no other significant vendor obligations exist  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
all elements of each order are valued at the time of revenue recognition 
license revenues generally include software maintenance agreements for the first year following the date of sale 
in such cases  revenues are allocated between licenses fees and maintenance revenues based on vendor specific evidence 
revenues from first year maintenance agreements and separately priced software maintenance agreements for subsequent years are deferred and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the maintenance period 
neon also markets and sells its products through independent distributors and resellers 
license and maintenance revenues from these transactions are recognized when sold to the ultimate end user and all of the above conditions are met 
capitalized software costs neon follows sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
research and development expenditures in general have been charged to operations as incurred 
no such costs have been capitalized to date 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as a part of its normal accounting procedures  neon evaluates outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected 
this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected 
in estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance  we consider specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and additional reserves  based on historical collections  for the remainder of our accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses  and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible 
if our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deferred income taxes neon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
in order to compute these deferred tax balances  we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences 
these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  we must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 
the change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations 
if our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate  the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods 
such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment 
accounting for advances to scalable software as discussed more fully in related party transactions above  certain members of neon s board of directors and executive officers also serve as directors and executive officers of scalable software and claim beneficial ownership of approximately of scalable s common stock 
in addition  neon has an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of scalable software and is currently providing scalable s primary financing for its operations 
therefore  neon determined that it has effective control of scalable software and began accounting for its investment in scalable software using the modified equity method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  neon recognizes of scalable software s losses to the extent of its advances made to scalable software in excess of the amounts guaranteed by messrs 
moores  woodhill and woodhill 
advance payments to pbtc as discussed more fully in related party transactions above  as part of a distribution agreement with pbtc  neon makes advance royalty payments to pbtc 
pbtc earns such advance payments as neon recognizes license and maintenance revenues related to its distribution of the pbtc products 
at the termination of the agreement  pbtc is to reimburse neon for any unearned royalty advances 
in determining whether the unearned advance payments to pbtc may be realized and recovered  management considers the future revenue anticipated to be generated from the license and maintenance of pbtc products  as well as pbtc s ability and intent to reimburse any unearned royalty advances 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods illustrated  certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues years ended march  revenues license maintenance total revenue cost of revenues cost of license cost of maintenance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs asset write down charges amortization of goodwill total operating expenses operating income loss interest  net equity loss in affiliate gain from settlement of litigation valuation allowance of note receivable other  net income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal years ended march    and revenues total revenues

license revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing period to period changes of and for the fiscal and periods 
the decrease in fiscal of million as compared to fiscal  and the decrease of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to an overall weakness in the mainframe software market since december  license revenues includes million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  of revenue under a software distribution agreement with bmc software entered in connection with neon s settlement of a lawsuit originally filed by bmc software 
product price increases during the periods were not significant

cost of license revenues was million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total license revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases were due primarily to increased sales of enterprise subsystem management products  resulting in increased royalties paid to peregrine bridge transfer corporation under neon s distributorship agreement with peregrine bridge transfer corporation 
cost of maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues includes personnel and other costs related to neon s customer support departments 
cost of maintenance revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total maintenance revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar changes during the periods were due principally to changes in the number of technical support staff providing support to neon s customer base 
neon expects that annual cost of maintenance will increase in absolute dollars but should not vary substantially as a percentage of total maintenance revenues from the level experienced in fiscal operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions  bonuses  benefits and travel expenses of sales  presales support and marketing personnel  together with trade show participation and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal is due primarily to the reduction in total revenue for the period then ended 
the dollar decrease from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from decreases in travel costs and marketing activity such as trade shows and advertisements as well as decreased commissions related to lower sales 
the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from increases in compensation costs due to the hiring of additional north american sales personnel and increased commissions  as well as an increase in costs associated with the sales offices in the united kingdom and germany 
in addition  the dollar increase reflects increased commissions to neon s independent international agents and increased marketing and selling expenses  principally due to increases in marketing efforts and a larger number of sales and marketing staff 
as neon continues to devote resources to the enhancement and expansion of its sales and marketing organization  neon expects that annual sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars

research and development expenses include salaries  bonuses and benefits to product development and product documentation personnel and the computer hardware  software and telecommunication expenses associated with these personnel 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in each of these respective periods 
the decrease in the percentage of total revenue and dollars in fiscal is primarily due to the reduction of development personnel associated with neon s change in product strategy 
the dollar and percentage increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased compensation costs due to additional staffing 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollar amounts

general and administrative expenses include salaries  personnel and related costs for neon s executive  financial  legal and administrative staff 
general and administrative expenses were million  million excluding million from nonrecurring charges during fiscal and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the nonrecurring charges consisted of million for charges related to the departure of certain personnel  a  charge for the cost of strategic consulting projects and a  realized foreign currency loss 
the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal  excluding nonrecurring charges  is primarily from increases in office occupancy costs and the related computer hardware  software and telecommunication expenses related to expansion of office facilities  and increases in personnel costs 
the percentage increase is due to a reduction in total revenue in fiscal the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal  excluding non recurring charges  is due to increases in occupancy costs and increases in compensation expenses due principally to administrative personnel additions necessary to support neon s expected growth 
neon anticipates general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
restructuring costs and asset write down charges 
during the year ended march   the company recorded a restructuring charge of  these charges related to reductions in the company s cost structure and corporate reorganization  including reductions in force  and abandonment of leased facilities 
these restructuring costs included severance costs of  and losses from lease commitments of  in addition  neon has recorded a non cash charge of  during the year ended march  related to the write down of pre paid royalties and other assets 
non cash compensation 
the deferred compensation balance was reduced by   and  during fiscal  and  respectively  due to the cancellation of restricted stock awards and options associated with terminated employees

amortization expense related to this transaction of  was recognized in both fiscal and interest income  net 
interest income net was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the changes are primarily the result of changes in cash and investment balances during the respective periods as well as changes in the investment yields realized

thereafter  neon may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or if available  that such financing will be obtainable on terms acceptable to neon  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and  as amended  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires balance sheet recognition of derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of sfas could increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income in the future 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period 
effective april   neon adopted sfas and has not identified any derivative instruments subject to the provisions of sfas in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june   and specifies criteria for the recognition and reporting of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but instead tests those assets for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over such lives to their estimated residual values 
the company adopted sfas no 
on july  and adopted sfas no 
on april  any goodwill or any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that is acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized through march  sfas no 
requires the company to perform a transitional goodwill impairment evaluation as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company then has up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of the date of adoption of sfas nos 
and  the company s unamortized goodwill in the amount of  is subject to transition provisions of sfas nos 
and amortization expense related to goodwill was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
management has completed a preliminary evaluation of the effects of sfas nos 
and and does not currently believe that they will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains many of its fundamental provisions 
sfas no
