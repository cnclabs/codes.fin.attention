item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
all references to earnings per share included in this discussion are to diluted earnings per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records reductions to selling prices as product and goods are shipped 
these reductions are based on competitive and market conditions  in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances 
these reductions are recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to invoice or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments 
such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customer financials through monitoring services 
based on these reviews  additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period 
the company also maintains a reserve to reduce the value of inventory to net realizable value 
specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of the company s business units 
the company will adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels 
the company estimates the required inventory reserve by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis and may increase or decrease the reserve based on these assessments 
the company offers certain warranties with the sale of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  supplier performance  and new product performance 
should a change in trend occur in customer claims  an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary 
the company incurs expenses in the form of product liability claims as the result of product malfunctions or misuse 
the company maintains insurance for a portion of this exposure and records a liability for its non insured obligations 
the company estimates its product liability obligations on a case by case basis in addition to a review of product performance trends 
these estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available or issues with product performance occur

interest expense in was million in comparison to million in the lower interest expense is due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher borrowing levels during the year 
the principal reasons for these results and the status of the company s financial condition are set forth below 
sales for the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in operating income in was million compared to million in the decline in sales is primarily the result of lower lawn mower unit sales as reflected in the following table in millions increase decrease in chain saw components lawn mowers and accessories other total segment sales the decline in operating income in reflects the lower unit sales of dixon lawn mowers  reflective of a weak industry demand and reduced sales and profitability within the european market due primarily to the strong united states dollar 
the company s industrial and power equipment segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the performance of the forestry industry in general  particularly in the company s most important market the southeastern united states 
throughout  the forestry industry operated within a cyclical downturn environment which resulted in weak demand for new equipment sales 
sales of gear components and rotation bearings declined in from the prior year as demand declined with a slowdown in the utility and construction markets that the segment serves 
sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in timber harvesting and loading equipment gear components and rotation bearings total segment sales page during  the segment had an operating loss of million compared to an operating profit of million in the decline in profitability is predominantly the result of the reduced sales level offset by reduced sg a expenses of million resulting from a plant closure and significant headcount reduction actions taken in income from discontinued operations in includes the results of seg which was sold on december  net income in was million compared to million in the decline in profitability is due to a decline in sales from million in to million in this performance reflects lower sales of ammunition to the retail market sector due to high distributor inventory levels  caused in part by the carryover effects of yk buying  lower competitive selling prices on optics products  and reduced shipments due to the december  sale of this segment to atk see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income was impacted by lower ammunition volume and selling prices due to customer and product shift  lower optics selling prices  and reduced sale of accessories  partially offset by lower selling  general  and administrative expense 
the loss on disposal of million in reflects the sale of seg and primarily results from income tax expense due to the difference in book and tax basis of assets 
the extraordinary loss of million represents the writeoff net of tax of unamortized deferred financing costs together with prepayment penalties related to the early payment of debt with the net proceeds generated from the sale of seg

per share 
the results reflect increased sales and operating income from the outdoor products segment and lower sales and higher operating income in the industrial and power equipment segment 
the improved results in the outdoor products segment is indicative of favorable market conditions including the effects of storm damage in europe  partially offset by the negative impact of the us dollar s strength on overseas sales 
the industrial and power equipment segment reflects the effects of plant rationalization actions taken in and the introduction of new products  partially offset by a downturn in market conditions during corporate expenses in include million for the donation of art see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the expenses associated with the recapitalization and merger and the donation of art  selling  general and administrative expenses were equal in and this was the result of reduced corporate expenditures related to cost reduction actions and lower incentive compensation expenses  partially offset by higher expenses within the outdoor products segment related to higher sales volumes 
higher interest expense for reflects higher long term debt levels during the current year resulting from the merger and recapitalization transaction highlighted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective tax rate was higher in in comparison to  primarily the result of the non deductible portions of the merger and recapitalization expenses 
the principal reasons for these results and the status of the company s financial condition are set forth below 
page sales in the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in operating income was million in compared to million in sales reflect a significantly higher volume of sales of chain saw components  particularly in europe and the united sates  with smaller increases in sales in other product lines as indicated in the table following in millions increase decrease in chain saw components lawn mowers and accessories other total segment sales the improvement in operating income was primarily due to the higher sales of chain saw components  partially offset by higher lawn mower manufacturing costs 
operating income in compared to was negatively affected by an additional million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange 
the company s industrial and power equipment segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the strength of the forestry industry in general  particularly in the company s most important market the southeastern united states  as well as the need to offer discounts in response to extremely aggressive competitive pricing for available sales 
segment sales in decreased to million from million as the market for forestry equipment weakened significantly in the second half of the year 
soft market conditions related to low wood prices  paper mill consolidations  higher fuel prices  and unfavorable weather conditions for a majority of the year  coupled with an overhang of used equipment in certain dealers inventories  continue to impact sales of new equipment 
sales of gear components and rotation bearings were essentially flat for the year as increased sales to the utility market were offset by decreases to the construction and forestry equipment markets 
sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in timber harvesting and loading equipment gear components and rotation bearings total segment sales segment operating income was million  which compares to an operating loss of million in the improved operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of fabtek  which was acquired in september  and lower manufacturing costs than  which included million expense related to the closure of two facilities  partially offset by the impact of lower unit shipments 
market conditions were extremely weak in the fourth quarter of and resulted in a segment operating loss of million for the quarter in comparison to an operating profit of million in the fourth quarter of these market dynamics continued throughout and management does not anticipate any significant improvement in the first half of if current market conditions were to continue  it would be unlikely this segment could achieve historical levels of sales and profitability 
page net income from discontinued operations reflects the results of seg which was sold in net income declined to million in from million in sales during the same periods declined to million from million 
this performance reflects lower sales of ammunition which was somewhat impacted by yk buying in and lower competitive selling prices on optical products in  partially offset by increased sales to law enforcement and international markets 
the decrease in net income was the result of the lower sales  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december   as a result of the merger and recapitalization transactions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant amounts of debt  with interest payments on the notes and interest and principal payments under the new credit facilities representing significant obligations for the company 
the notes require semi annual interest payments and the term loan facilities under the new credit facilities require payments of principal through in conjunction with the sale of seg on december   the company utilized million of proceeds to reduce the term loan facilities 
at december   the term loan outstanding was million 
payments of million annually through and million in are required 
interest on the term loan facilities and amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are payable in arrears according to varying interest periods 
the company s remaining liquidity needs relate to working capital needs  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions 
the company intends to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash flows generated from operations and from the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has an availability of up to million 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility which reduce the amount available under the facility were million at december  the revolving credit facility will mature august  certain customers of the company s outdoor products and industrial and power equipment segments finance their purchases through third party finance companies 
under the terms of these financing arrangements  the company may be required to repurchase certain equipment from the finance companies 
the aggregate repurchase amount included in the agreements outstanding as of december  is million 
these arrangements have not had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results in the past 
the company does not expect to incur any material charges related to these agreements in future periods  as any repurchase of equipment will likely be resold 
the company also sold certain trade account receivables to a third party in with value of million with minimal recourse approximately of value 
at december  and  the company did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs  including financing for acquisitions  in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
the company may also consider other options available to it in connection with future liquidity needs 
page the company has senior notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in the company also has senior subordinated notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the terms and conditions of the senior notes  the senior subordinated notes  and the senior term loans 
in conjunction with the sale of seg  the company and its lenders amended the credit agreement relating to the outstanding term loans 
among other things  this amendment adjusted the financial coverage ratios covenants to reflect the sale of seg and cures any event of default under the credit agreement that had been communicated to the lenders on october  the company is in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its credit agreement or indentures 
further  the company does not have any rating triggers that would accelerate repayment of outstanding debt 
cash balances at december  were million compared to million at december  the year end cash balance increased primarily from the december  sale of seg which resulted in proceeds of million after the repayment of million of outstanding debt and a portion of the transaction expenses 
the cash on hand at the end of the year will be utilized in part to pay in the first quarter of outstanding expenses related to the seg transaction 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million compared to million last year 
the increase is due to increased cash generated by reduced inventory million  offset by lower net income from continuing operations of million  reduced cash from accounts receivable of million  and the impact of deferred taxes of million 
cash provided by the operating activities of discontinued operations was million in compared to million in the increase is due to reduced working capital  partially offset by lower net income 
cash generated from investing activities was million compared to a use of million last year 
this year s investing activities include the proceeds from the sale of seg 
last year s investing activities included million for the acquisitions discussed in note cash used for financing activities was million compared to a source of million in the increase in use primarily reflects the repayment of debt from the seg sale proceeds and operating activities 
the proceeds of the seg sale to atk generated cash of million in  with anticipated net proceeds of million after the payment in of million outstanding transaction expenses 
working capital at december  was million compared to million last year 
the decrease is due to the sale of seg that resulted in a year over year decrease of million in working capital offset by a million increase in cash 
excluding the impact of the seg sale  accounts receivable declined by million and inventories declined by million from these decreases reflect a reduction in production output in line with market demand in order to minimize inventory levels 
accounts receivable at december   and december   and sales by segment for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of were as follows in millions december  december  increase decrease accounts receivable outdoor products industrial and power equipment total segment receivables page three months ended december  december  increase decrease sales outdoor products industrial and power equipment total segment sales the company s outdoor products segment includes oregon cutting systems  frederick manufacturing  and dixon industries 
the decrease from last year in outdoor products accounts receivable is reflective of the third party dealer financing offered by dixon and proportionately an increase of domestic sales of oregon cutting systems products which generally require shorter payment terms 
accounts receivable within the industrial and power equipment segment declined from last year due to improved collection efforts and a reduction in extended term receivables offered in response to market and competitive factors 
at december   there were approximately million in receivables with extended terms compared to million at december  the company expects the cash flow from operations and the amounts available under its revolving credit agreements will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital until market conditions improve in the industrial and power equipment segment 
no material adverse effect on the operations  liquidity or capital resources of the company is expected as a result of the extended terms program 
during  the company would not have been in compliance with certain of its debt covenants except for the fact that  in connection with the sale of seg  the company and its lenders amended the covenants  accordingly  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of and for the year ended december  while there can be no assurance  management believes the company will comply with all debt covenants during should the company not comply with the covenants during  additional significant actions will be required 
these actions may include  among others  attempting to renegotiate its debt facilities  sales of assets  additional restructurings and reductions in capital expenditures 
immediately after the merger and recapitalization transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company became substantially leveraged which may adversely affect its operations 
this substantial leverage could have important consequences for the company  including the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired or may not be available on favorable terms  a substantial portion of cash flows available from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net income and cash flows or an increase in expenses may make it difficult to meet debt service requirements or force the company to modify operations  and substantial leverage may make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressure 
page market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of expectations as regards to future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  the company has  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and has entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december   no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in under its credit agreement  the company was required to enter into hedge agreements within days of the borrowing and maintain such hedge agreements in place until the second anniversary of the borrowing  such that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the borrowings are subject to a fixed rate of interest 
this requirement expired on august  foreign currency exchange risk approximately of oregon s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of oregon s reported sales and operating income 
historically  the company s principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and local currency sales and expenses in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  the company has not used derivatives to manage any significant foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain raw materials for the manufacture of products 
some of these raw materials are subject to price volatility over periods of time 
the company has not hedged against the price change within its continuing operations segments with any derivative instruments
