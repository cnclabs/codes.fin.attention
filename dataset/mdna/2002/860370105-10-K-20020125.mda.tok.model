item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of fiscal year during fiscal year  the company focused on restructuring and reducing its debt  pursuing the sale of its foreign operations  improving cash flow and operating its core businesses 
on june   the company completed the refinancing of substantially all of its long term debt 
the refinancing extended the company s long term debt maturities four to seven years but increased its cost of debt by approximately basis points 
the refinancing also resulted in an extraordinary charge to earnings for the early extinguishment of debt of million  after taxes 
the refinancing is described in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company decided to sell its foreign operations and certain domestic assets  primarily excess cemetery property and funeral home real estate  and wrote down the value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
primarily as a result of these actions  the company incurred an aggregate after tax noncash charge to earnings of million  of which million related to foreign operations 
because the company has already reduced equity for the cumulative foreign translation adjustment incurred in each period that it has owned its foreign businesses  the total related charge to shareholders equity for the loss on its foreign operations is estimated to ultimately be million 
for additional information  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has made substantial progress with its plan to sell its foreign operations  and as of october   the company had completed the sale of all of its foreign operations other than those in southern europe france  spain and portugal  canada and argentina 
the company also sold domestic assets  primarily excess cemetery property and funeral home real estate 
the company used the proceeds from these transactions  along with free cash flow  to reduce debt from million at the end of fiscal year to million  excluding debt associated with assets held for sale as of october  subsequent to october   the company signed a binding contract for the sale of its operations in southern europe and will use the net proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt 
also during fiscal year  the company implemented sab no 
which changed the way the company records preneed sales 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change resulted in an after tax charge to earnings of million 
the impact of sab no 
is discussed in more detail below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although not required to implement sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  until the first quarter of fiscal year  the company intends to implement it in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas no 
establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment by requiring that goodwill be separately tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach rather than an undiscounted cash flow approach 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment loss will be recognized and treated as a change in accounting principle 
without clear guidance as to the constitution of a reporting unit  the company s initial understanding was that a reporting unit could range from an individual facility level to a regional level 
consequently  the company preliminarily estimated that it would incur a pre tax noncash impairment charge of between million to million for its domestic operations 
since the company s initial analysis  there has been clarification and guidance on the application of this pronouncement  including guidance related to the determination of a reporting unit 
this clarification has resulted in the company s evaluation of goodwill at the funeral and cemetery segment level  which it believes constitutes the company s reporting unit 
accordingly  the company believes that the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of will not result in a material impairment charge 
upon the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized 
the company s foreign operations will not be affected as they have been previously marked to fair value 
the company s amortization of goodwill amounted to million million related to domestic operations in fiscal year 
table of contents during fiscal year  the company plans to continue to focus on debt reduction and to position itself for business expansion in general the company sells cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
the company s revenues in each period consist primarily of at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of the company s backlog during the period  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care earnings and finance charges 
preneed sales the company considers maintaining its preneed backlog through preneed marketing and sales to be an integral part of its long term business strategy 
the company s primary objective is to produce preneed sales levels sufficient to balance its cash investment with its goal of maintaining a sustainable and predictable level of growth in its preneed backlog 
the company s current goal is to make four preneed funeral sales for every three it delivers 
the company estimates that as of october  the future value of its domestic preneed backlog represented billion to billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust  assuming an average yield of about percent and a build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future sales and assumes maturities of the existing contracts over a weighted average life of approximately to years  which is consistent with the company s experience 
while the investment yield over the past five years has been in this range  there is no guarantee that future yields will be at this level 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including earnings realized to date on the funds held in trust  was approximately billion 
preneed property  products and services are typically sold on an installment basis with terms of approximately three to five years 
in fiscal year  the company changed the terms and conditions of its preneed sales contracts and commissions  and moderated its preneed sales activities  in order to enhance its cash flow 
these changes are described in more detail under the heading  results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment below 
with respect to the sale of cemetery property  whether preneed or at need  the company is generally required by state law to place into a perpetual care trust  a portion  usually percent  of the proceeds it receives in order to fund maintenance of the cemetery grounds 
as payments are received  the company generally funds the perpetual care trust in the same proportion as the payment bears to the contract amount  for example  if the company receives percent of the contract price  it places in trust percent of the total amount to be placed in trust for that contract 
the company withdraws realized earnings  including net realized capital gains in some jurisdictions  on these funds to use towards the maintenance of its cemeteries  but principal must generally be held in the trust in perpetuity 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery and funeral products and services  state laws generally require either a portion of the installment payments received be placed into a trust fund or the use of an insurance policy underwritten by an insurance company to provide funds to cover the costs of delivering funeral products and services in the future 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery merchandise  the company is generally required to place in trust to percent of each installment received 
with respect to the preneed sale of funeral and cemetery services  the company is generally required to place in trust to percent of each installment received 
the sale of caskets is treated in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of cemetery merchandise and in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of funeral services for these purposes 
when insurance is used  the company applies customer payments to pay premiums on the insurance policies 
the company typically acts as agent for the insurance company and earns a commission 
generally  the company can withdraw the principal of and earnings on the funds placed in trust only at the time that the related products and services are delivered 

table of contents if a preneed funeral product or service contract is cancelled  the company generally returns to the customer the related principal that was placed in trust and retains the portion not placed in trust 
in many jurisdictions  the company can withdraw and retain all related earnings in the trust  but in other jurisdictions these earnings must be returned to the customer 
if a preneed cemetery property  product or service contract is cancelled  the company generally is not required to return any funds to the customer 
the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
the company generally pays commissions to its preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because the company is required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  it may be required to use its own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
cash expended for preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales  principally sales commissions  is capitalized in deferred charges on the balance sheet and amortized and expensed as cost of sales as the contracts are delivered 
implementation of staff accounting bulletin no 
effective november   the company implemented staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  which resulted in changing its methods of accounting for preneed sales activities 
the effect of the change in accounting principles is described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item a description of the company s current accounting for preneed sales and trust and escrow account earnings after implementation of sab no 
follows 
summary of current accounting for preneed sales revenue from preneed sales of funeral services and funeral merchandise is deferred until the period in which the funeral is performed and the merchandise is delivered 
on the balance sheet  the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer is reflected in prearranged receivables asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer is reflected part in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and part in cash for the portion the company is allowed to retain 
the costs to acquire the sales  primarily commissions and other direct costs  are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred charges asset and are charged to expense as the funeral services are performed and products delivered 
indirect costs of marketing preneed funeral services and merchandise are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
as the customer makes payments on the preneed contract  the portion of prearranged receivables representing the receivable due from the customer declines  and the portion representing the receivable from the trust increases 
the company records cash for the amount of cash received that is not required to be placed in trust 
realized earnings on the amounts held in trust represent a debit to prearranged receivables asset and a credit to prearranged deferred revenue liability and are not recognized as revenue until delivery of the service or merchandise 

table of contents when the funeral service or merchandise is delivered  the company recognizes as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract  with a corresponding reduction recorded to prearranged deferred revenue liability 
the company debits cash with the amount removed from trust that is attributable to the contract consisting of the customer s payments and related realized earnings  all of which is withdrawn at that time and records a corresponding reduction in prearranged receivables asset 
associated deferred charges asset are expensed  and the actual expenses incurred in delivering the services and merchandise are recognized 
preneed sales of cemetery merchandise  primarily vaults and markers  and preneed sales of cemetery services  primarily openings and closings of burial sites and installations of markers  are accounted for in essentially the same manner as preneed sales of funeral services and merchandise 
additional information about the company s prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue is contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
for preneed sales of interment rights cemetery property  the associated revenue and all costs to acquire the sale are recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
under sfas no 
 recognition of revenue and costs must be deferred until percent of the property sales price has been collected 
a portion  generally percent  of the sale proceeds are placed into perpetual care trust funds 
the company withdraws and recognizes realized earnings from these funds on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining its cemetery grounds 
the perpetual care trust funds are not reflected on the financial statements because principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
summary of current accounting for trust and escrow account earnings the company has three types of trust funds and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care 
as described below  earnings on preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts are now accounted for in the same manner 
the accounting for earnings on perpetual care trust funds differs from the other two types of trust funds due to the nature of the trusts  as described below 
preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for earnings realized by those preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts where it is allowed to retain earnings on the funds if the contract is cancelled 
the company now defers recognition of all earnings realized by these trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying funeral service or merchandise is delivered 
for those trust funds and escrow accounts where it must return earnings on the funds if the contract is cancelled  it has always deferred recognition of realized earnings until the underlying funeral service or merchandise is delivered 
these accounting methods were not affected by the implementation of sab no 
the company generally does not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
as discussed above  effective november   the company implemented sab no 
and changed its method of accounting for earnings realized by preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
the company now defers all earnings from these funds until the underlying merchandise or service is delivered 
the company generally does not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
table of contents perpetual care trust funds 
the company recognizes the earnings on its perpetual care trust funds as they are realized in the trust 
this accounting method was not affected by the implementation of sab no 
the company generally withdraws the earnings on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining its cemeteries 
principal in these funds is not reflected on the balance sheet because the principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
income from funds  especially those invested partially in common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its north american funds including those in puerto rico that have investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual yield of approximately percent to percent  which is well in excess of the company s expectation for inflation over the short term 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular yield 
the company does not expect to achieve this goal in fiscal year in its perpetual care trust funds 
results of operations the company implemented sab no 
in fiscal year in the following discussion  the results for the year ended october   as reported after the implementation of sab no 
 are compared with the results for the year ended october   as reported  which do not reflect the implementation of sab no 
following this is a discussion of results for compared to as presented on a historical basis  which does not reflect the implementation of sab no 
the company has also included a pro forma comparison using the same accounting methods for both the years ended october  and for the pro forma discussion  the year ended october  is presented as reported after the implementation of sab no 
 and the year ended october  is adjusted on a pro forma basis to show the effects of sab no 
as the company has its foreign operations and several small domestic operations held for sale  in the third quarter of it began segregating the operating results of these businesses from the operations it will retain 
the following discussion segregates the financial results into two main categories in order to present the company s ongoing operating results and to provide more useful information for investors 
the company s operations to be retained consist of those businesses it has owned and operated for the entire fiscal year and last and which are not for sale existing operations and those businesses that have been acquired or opened during this fiscal year or last acquired opened operations 
closed and held for sale operations consist of those that have been sold or closed during this fiscal year or last and the businesses that are currently being sold or offered for sale 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  decrease as reported in millions funeral revenue funeral costs funeral segment profit funeral revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease due to the effect of 
table of contents implementing sab no 
additionally  during fiscal year  the company sold several of its foreign operations with the remainder held for sale  and several small domestic operations have either been sold or are held for sale 
this resulted in a decline in funeral revenue and costs as described below in the section entitled year ended october  compared to pro forma year ended october  slightly offsetting these decreases was an increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by operations to be retained of percent and an increase of percent in the number of funeral services performed by operations to be retained events 
cemetery segment year ended october  decrease as reported in millions cemetery revenue cemetery costs cemetery segment profit cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a decrease in cemetery merchandise deliveries and reduced preneed cemetery property sales 
the company also experienced an average yield of percent in its perpetual care trust funds  which is below the company s goal of percent to percent  compared to percent in fiscal year partially offsetting this decrease was a million  or percent  increase due to the implementation of sab no 
in fiscal year the company changed the terms and conditions of its preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated its preneed sales activities in order to enhance its cash flow 
this resulted in an anticipated reduction in preneed sales  including preneed cemetery property sales mentioned above 
the company modified its preneed payment plans early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
effective the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company also substantially reduced the commissions paid on sales of preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise  which the company believes had the largest impact on preneed sales 
although the company reduced or eliminated commissions available to preneed sales counselors on certain sales  the company now provides a minimum compensation guarantee 
the change in commission structure provides an incentive to preneed sales counselors to focus on selling preneed cemetery property and preneed funeral services 
the company believes that these are the sales that build and maintain market share 
in addition  the change better aligned operations with changes in accounting necessitated by the adoption of sab no 
because  after the implementation of sab no 
 preneed cemetery property sales are the only preneed sales that the company recognizes on a current basis after collection of percent of the sales price 
the company also believes that these changes have improved the quality of preneed sales and receivables 
these changes in preneed sales strategies contributed to a decline in the full time domestic preneed sales force from approximately  counselors during the first quarter of fiscal year to  counselors by the end of fiscal year the company believes that it has retained its best sales counselors 
the company has also reduced its selling costs by closing selected telemarketing and sales offices 
the company has not experienced  and does not expect  any significant further decline in the size of the preneed sales force 
other corporate general and administrative expenses in decreased million as compared to primarily due to consulting fees incurred in related to the company s extensive consumer market research project 
net interest expense of million  which is comprised of gross interest expense of million  netted with interest income of million  increased million during fiscal year compared to the same period in net interest expense of million in fiscal year is comprised of gross interest expense of million offset by million of interest income 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average rates due to the higher interest costs associated with debt incurred in the company s recent refinancing transactions  which was substantially offset by a million decrease in the average outstanding debt balance 
interest income resulted from cash and cash equivalent investments earning an average rate of percent including funds in foreign jurisdictions earning percent 

table of contents other income  net  increased approximately million during fiscal year compared to the same period in due principally to net gains on the sale of excess cemetery property 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  effective march   the company pays a fixed rate of percent and receives three month libor 
the swap expires on march   at which time the million becomes subject to short term variable interest rates 
as of october   the company s outstanding debt totaled million  including million of debt associated with assets held for sale 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreement  approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  the following discussion compares the company s financial results for fiscal year and fiscal year  both as reported 
these results do not reflect the implementation of sab no 
the accounting methods used in both periods were the same  therefore  the results for these two periods are comparable 
funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions funeral revenue existing operations acquired opened operations funeral costs existing operations acquired opened operations funeral segment profit funeral revenue increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from existing operations as a result of several factors 
first  the company experienced a percent increase in the average revenue per domestic funeral service performed by existing operations percent increase worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
this increase in average revenue per funeral service was due in part to enhanced funeral arranger training  improved merchandising and personalization of services and product offerings based on findings of the company s extensive consumer market study 
offsetting the increase in average revenue per funeral service was a million reduction in prearranged funeral merchandise sales  a million reduction in revenue from changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally the euro and a percent decrease  events in the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations percent decrease  events worldwide 
however  included in the  events were over low end direct cremation events that the company elected not to sell at prices its competitors were charging 
additionally  discount services provided in the ordinary course of business in the industry on behalf of other funeral homes or institutions declined by approximately events as a result of the company s decision to decrease its level of 
table of contents discounted services 
when these low end and discounted events are removed from the calculation  the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations decreased by approximately events  which translates to less than one event per domestic core funeral home 
these low end and discounted events were price sensitive and generally not profitable 
changes in the company s preneed sales strategies during fiscal year had the effect of considerably reducing all preneed sales 
these changes are described above in the discussion of results of operations for the cemetery segment for fiscal year funeral profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in due primarily to the reduction in sales of prearranged funeral merchandise as described above 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of funeral homes from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 
cemetery segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions cemetery revenue existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery costs existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery segment profit cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from existing operations resulting primarily from reduced preneed sales 
slightly offsetting this decrease was an approximate million  or percent  increase in revenue from preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts and perpetual care trust funds to million 
this increase was due to an increase in the average yield on the funds  coupled with an increase in the average balance 
the yield for the year was slightly higher than the company s goal of percent to percent 
changes in the company s preneed sales strategies during fiscal year  which are detailed in the above discussion of results of operations for the cemetery segment for fiscal year  had the effect of considerably reducing preneed cemetery sales 
cemetery profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in the decline was attributable principally to reduced preneed sales as described above  coupled with the high fixed cost nature of the cemetery business 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of cemeteries from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 

table of contents other corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to percent of revenue in fiscal year  as compared to percent in fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in consulting fees related to the company s extensive consumer market research project  partially offset by a reduction in corporate development costs  travel costs and executive bonuses 
net interest expense  which is comprised of gross interest expense of million  netted with interest income of million  increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year this is due principally to an increase in average interest rates from percent in to percent in  coupled with an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from acquisitions that closed late in the increase in gross interest expense was partially offset by an approximate million increase in interest income generated from increased cash and cash equivalents earning an average rate of percent including funds in foreign jurisdictions earning percent 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  effective march   the company pays a fixed rate of percent and receives three month libor 
the swap expires on march  as of october   the company s outstanding debt totaled million 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreement  approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
year ended october  compared to pro forma year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease pro forma in millions funeral operations to be retained revenue existing operations opened operations costs existing operations opened operations profit existing operations opened operations funeral closed and held for sale operations revenue costs profit total funeral revenue total funeral costs total funeral segment profit 
table of contents total funeral revenues declined million from fiscal year to  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from operations to be retained 
this decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations resulted from the sale of operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands in the fourth quarter of and changes in foreign currency exchange rates due in part to the euro 
funeral revenue from operations to be retained increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses increased percent  and the number of funeral services performed by these businesses increased percent events 
the company experienced a million  or percent  increase in funeral revenue from existing operations primarily due to a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service partially offset by a percent decline events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses 
about percent of the decline in the number of funeral services performed by existing operations was attributable to a decline in low priced services that the company elected to stop performing 
excluding these low priced services  the number of funeral services performed by the company s existing funeral homes declined less than one percent  or one to two funerals per location 
these low priced services consist primarily of services performed in the ordinary course of business in the industry on behalf of another funeral home or institution  and the company believes they are not indicative of a loss in market share 
the company experienced a million increase in funeral revenue and a million increase in funeral costs from opened operations primarily due to the opening of the archdiocese of los angeles facilities which were not open for the entirety of both periods presented 
funeral profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in primarily due to upward pressure on funeral costs  including labor costs  of approximately million as well as an increase in overhead costs allocated to the funeral segment of approximately million 
the company allocates common overhead between its segments based on revenue 
due to the moderation in preneed cemetery sales discussed above  the allocation has shifted a higher amount of those costs to the funeral segment and a corresponding lower amount to the cemetery segment 
preneed funeral in fiscal year  the company sold approximately two domestic funerals for every one it delivered 
throughout fiscal year the company changed the terms and conditions of its preneed sales contracts and commissions as described above in the section entitled year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment 
in fiscal year  the company further moderated its preneed sales strategy in order to improve its cash flow and modified its goal to begin selling four funerals for every three it delivered  which it achieved 
the result was improved cash flow as described in liquidity and capital resources 
in fiscal year  the company s preneed funeral service and merchandise sales  which are deferred and are not included in the results described above  decreased from the sale of  domestic preneed funerals with contract amounts representing million in fiscal year to  domestic preneed funerals with contract amounts representing million in fiscal year 
table of contents cemetery segment year ended october  increase decrease pro forma in millions cemetery operations to be retained revenue existing operations acquired opened operations costs existing operations acquired opened operations profit existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery closed and held for sale operations revenue costs profit total cemetery revenue total cemetery costs total cemetery segment profit cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from operations to be retained due to a decline in revenue from existing operations resulting primarily from a decrease in cemetery merchandise deliveries and reduced preneed cemetery property sales 
the reduction in preneed sales was anticipated due to the changes made to the company s preneed sales program in fiscal year  as discussed above in the section entitled year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment 
in addition  the company experienced an average yield of percent in its perpetual care trust funds  which was below the company s goal of percent to percent  compared to percent in fiscal year cemetery profit margin from existing operations increased from percent in to percent in the increase was principally due to cost savings resulting from the changes the company made in its preneed sales organization and additional cost savings at its cemeteries arising from increased scrutiny of expenses by local managers 
additionally  the cemetery margins benefited from the reduction in common overhead allocation mentioned in year ended october  compared to pro forma year ended october  funeral segment 
preneed cemetery the company s domestic preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  which are deferred and are not included in the results described above  decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the reduction in sales was due to the company s strategy of moderating its preneed sales to improve cash flow  as described above

depreciation and amortization was million for fiscal year compared to pro forma million for the same period in domestic depreciation and amortization  which is representative of operations to be retained  was million for fiscal year compared to pro forma million for the same period in ebitda defined as earnings before gross interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization excluding the nonrecurring  noncash loss on assets held for sale  the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles and extraordinary item was million  or percent of revenue for fiscal year compared to pro forma million  or percent of revenue for the same period in domestic ebitda  which is representative of operations to be retained  was million  or percent of domestic revenue for fiscal year compared to pro forma million  or percent of domestic revenue for the same period in net interest expense of million  which is comprised of gross interest expense of million  netted with interest income of million  increased million during fiscal year compared to the same period in net interest expense of million in fiscal year is comprised of gross interest expense of million offset by million of interest income 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average rates due to the higher interest costs associated with debt incurred in the company s recent refinancing transactions  which was substantially offset by a million decrease in the average outstanding debt balance 
interest income resulted from cash and cash equivalent investments earning an average rate of percent including funds in foreign jurisdictions earning percent 
other income  net  increased approximately million during fiscal year compared to the same period in due principally to net gains on the sale of excess cemetery property

liquidity and capital resources introduction historically  the company s growth has been primarily from acquisitions 
this trend began to change in late fiscal year as industry conditions reduced the number of major consolidators participating in the acquisition market  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursuing transactions at lower prices 
as the business model shifted  death care consolidators experienced diminishing access to capital 
in response to these changes  the company ceased its acquisition activity and developed strategies for improving cash flow and reducing and restructuring debt 
throughout fiscal years and  the company has focused on debt reduction and cash flow 
during fiscal year  the company plans to continue its focus on debt reduction and to position itself for business expansion in fiscal year 
table of contents the company believes that once its debt targets are achieved  it will be in a position to consider purchasing high quality firms with free cash flow 
debt restructuring and reduction  asset sales as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  on june   the company completed several transactions that refinanced substantially all of its long term debt 
in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company decided to pursue the sale of its foreign operations in order to generate cash to reduce debt and to allow the company to focus on its core businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company sold all of its foreign operations other than those in southern europe france  spain and portugal  canada and argentina and subsequently entered into a binding contract to sell its southern european operations 
in total  these transactions have generated or will generate proceeds  including future tax benefits  of million to million of the million to million in total proceeds the company expects to receive from the sale of all foreign operations

those proceeds were also used to reduce debt

additionally  operating cash flow increased due to million in proceeds from the sale of excess undeveloped cemetery property  a million tax refund and million in tax benefits 

table of contents the company s investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash inflow of million for fiscal year the increase was due primarily to million in proceeds from the sale of foreign operations and million in proceeds from the sale of domestic funeral home real estate and small domestic operations received by the company from the asset sales described above under debt restructuring and reduction  asset sales  net of expenses and cash balances of the operations sold 
the cash inflow from investing activities in was a result of converting certain voluntary escrow funds to cash for general operating purposes 
the company s financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a cash outflow of million for the comparable period in this is due principally to repayments of long term debt of million during the year ended october  and debt issue costs of million associated with the company s june debt refinancing  partially offset by proceeds from long term debt of million from the debt refinancing 
also offsetting this cash outflow was million that the company withdrew from its trust funds in florida in the first quarter of  whereby the company substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount 
as of november  the balance of the florida bond was million 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover its estimated cost of providing the related prearranged services and products in the future 
capital expenditures as part of its strategy to increase cash flow and reduce debt  in fiscal year the company limited its capital expenditures primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of funeral homes in connection with its operating partnership with the archdiocese of los angeles  and expects to do the same in fiscal year for a discussion of the operating partnership with the archdiocese of los angeles  see business strategy and operations 
for fiscal year  capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures and for new growth initiatives  primarily the construction of the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes

on december   the company filed a form k with detailed information discussing its financial forecasts for the summarized forecast information below is consistent with that information filed on form k 
the forecast financial information included in this form k has been prepared by  and is the responsibility of  the 
table of contents company s management 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp has neither examined nor compiled the accompanying forecast financial information and  accordingly  pricewaterhousecoopers llp does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 
the pricewaterhousecoopers llp report included in this form k relates to the company s historical financial information 
it does not extend to the forecast financial information and should not be read to do so 
accuracy of the forecasts is dependent on assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments 
the forecasts are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions made by management of the company with respect to  among other things  industry performance  general economic  market  industry and interest rate conditions  preneed and at need sales activities and trends  fluctuations in cost of goods sold and other expenses  capital expenditures  and other matters that cannot be accurately predicted  may not be realized and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company s control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the forecasts will prove accurate  and actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forecasts 
for these reasons  the forecasts should not be regarded as an accurate prediction of future results  but only of results that may be obtained if substantially all of management s principal expectations are realized 
the company cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s goal is to return to debt levels of approximately million  or times domestic ebitda 
management projects that the company will achieve this goal by the second quarter of by further reducing debt by approximately million to million with the estimated proceeds from the sale of its operations in southern europe france  spain and portugal  canada and argentina  plus future tax benefits associated with closed and prospective sales and with an additional amount of approximately million to million per year in free cash flow 
in addition  the company anticipates generating million to million in fiscal year from the sale of domestic assets 
by the end of  management expects to have completed the sale of all of its foreign operations  and all tax benefits are expected to be realized in fiscal years and management expects that once the company achieves its debt goal  it will be in a position to expand its businesses internally and to consider acquiring high quality firms  using internally generated free cash flow 
management projects fiscal year earnings per share of to before the possible noncash charge related to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill which the company does not expect to be material and cash flow from operations between million and million 
management expects the following factors to impact fiscal year financial results significant factors affecting earnings management expects that the sale of its foreign operations will cause revenues  operating earnings and net earnings for fiscal year to be lower than fiscal year  although the sales will have a positive impact on interest expense as proceeds are used to reduce debt 
the company expects interest expense to increase due to the refinancing completed on june   which increased the company s average borrowing rate by approximately basis points 
the company expects the increase in interest expense to be mitigated as it reduces debt 
the company intends to adopt sfas no 
effective november   and therefore would benefit from the elimination of domestic goodwill amortization for fiscal year in fiscal year  domestic goodwill amortization was million 
during fiscal year  the company benefited from million in nonrecurring net gains related to the sale of excess cemetery property  funeral home real estate and other assets 
the company expects that the yield on assets in its perpetual care trust funds will be below the percent yield achieved in fiscal year due to current market conditions and the mix of investments held in the trusts 
management expects the company s tax rate to increase  due primarily to the disposition of its foreign assets offset by the implementation of sfas no 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not result in a material noncash impairment charge in fiscal year 
table of contents significant factors affecting free cash flow cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures in fiscal year  the company realized cash benefits from several nonrecurring tax items such as a federal tax refund  a reduction in estimated tax payments  a refund of some state tax payments and repayment from the funeral trust funds for tax payments made on behalf of the trusts 
the company received million in cash proceeds in fiscal year from the sale of excess cemetery property 
interest expenditures are expected to increase  as described above 
the company s cash flow in fiscal year will be affected by any future foreign asset sales and the timing of the receipt of any tax benefits from completed and future sales 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
risks related to the company s business the company s ability to achieve its debt reduction targets and to service its debt in the future depends upon the company s ability to generate sufficient cash  which depends on many factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s ability to achieve its debt reduction targets in the time frame projected by the company depends upon the company s ability to generate sufficient cash from three main sources the sale of its remaining foreign assets in southern europe france  spain and portugal  canada and argentina  income tax benefits associated with the foreign asset sales and its ongoing operations 
the company cannot control whether or when it will be able to complete transactions for the sale of its remaining foreign assets with buyers willing to accept terms anticipated by the company s forecasts 
the timing of the receipt of the income tax benefits depends on the rate at which the company can produce capital gains against which the asset sale losses can be offset and the timing of the company s filing for capital loss carrybacks to apply against previously taxed capital gains 
the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in the company s markets  competition  the level of preneed sales  the company s ability to control its costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  much of which is beyond the company s control 
the company may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors including changes made to contract terms and sales force compensation  or a weakening economy 
declines in preneed sales would reduce the company s backlog and revenue and could reduce its future market share 
in an effort to increase cash flow  the company modified its preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
later in fiscal year  the company changed the compensation structure for its preneed sales force 
these changes  and the accompanying sales force attrition and adverse impact on sales force morale  caused preneed sales to decline 
although the company does not anticipate making further significant changes in these areas  it may decide that further adjustments are advisable  which could cause additional declines in preneed sales 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to have less discretionary income could cause a decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce the company s backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 

table of contents increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
in fiscal year  the company changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated its preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment 
nevertheless  the company will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow will be further reduced  and the company s ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
price competition could reduce market share or cause the company to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
the company s funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
the company has historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
in the past  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  the company has had to reduce prices and thereby profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
in addition  because of competition from these types of competitors in some key markets  in fiscal year the company lowered its goals for increases in average revenue per funeral service performed in the future 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased services from internet providers  could cause the company to lose market share and revenues or cause the company to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture the company s market share 
in recent years  marketing through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause the company to lose market share and revenues or cause it to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing the company to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by the company 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause the company to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
the company does not currently sell products or services over the internet 
earnings from and principal of trust funds and escrow accounts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates or by a decline in the size of the funds 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and escrow accounts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within the company s control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that the company chooses to maintain in the funds  and it may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the funds depends upon the level of preneed sales  the amount of investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and escrow accounts could cause a decline in future revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient 
table of contents funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
as of october   net unrealized depreciation in the domestic funeral  cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
see notes and in the company s consolidated financial statements 
increases in interest rates would increase the company s interest costs on its variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and earnings per share 
as of october   million of the company s long term debt was subject to variable interest rates  although million of that amount was fixed pursuant to the terms of an interest rate swap expiring march  accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates  particularly after march   could substantially increase the company s interest costs on its variable rate long term debt  which could decrease the company s net income and earnings per share materially 
covenant restrictions under the company s senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated note indenture limit the company s flexibility in operating its business 
the company s senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict the company s and the subsidiary guarantors ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
they limit  among other things  the company s and the subsidiary guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
in addition  the senior secured credit facilities contain specific limits on capital expenditures as well as a requirement that the company maintain a liquidity reserve that increases over time as long as any of the notes or roars are outstanding 
furthermore  the senior secured credit facilities require the company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
these covenants may require the company to act in a manner contrary to its business objectives 
in addition  events beyond the company s control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect its ability to satisfy these covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default allowing the lenders to declare all amounts immediately due and payable 
the company believes that the completion of the sale of its remaining foreign operations will not violate these covenants 
the company s foreign operations are subject to political  economic  currency and other risks that could adversely impact its financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
the company s foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries 
risks associated with operating internationally include political  social and economic instability  increased operating costs  expropriation and complex and changing government regulations  all of which are beyond the company s control 
to the extent the company makes investments in foreign assets or receives revenues in currencies other than us dollars  the value of assets and income could be  and have in the past been  adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of local currencies 

table of contents risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in the company s markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
in addition  changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in the company s markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because the company could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  profit margins than traditional funerals 
the company s traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the united states burial market by the year  compared to percent in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if the company is not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  the company s market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on the company s ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during fiscal year  the company began to implement strategies based on a proprietary  extensive study of consumer preferences it commissioned in however  the company may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or it may identify them later than its competitors do 
in addition  any strategies the company may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  the company must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because the company cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when it experiences declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to the company s business could increase costs 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws and the laws of foreign jurisdictions where it operates 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental 
table of contents and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome on the company  and it is always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs
