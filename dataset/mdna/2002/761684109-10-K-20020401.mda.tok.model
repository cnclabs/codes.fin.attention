net income loss management discussion and analysis overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
as is generally the case in the recreational vehicle industry  various factors can influence sales 
these factors include demographics  changes in interest rates  competition  restrictions on the availability of financing for the wholesale and retail purchases of recreational vehicles  as well as significant changes in the availability and price of gasoline 
the company was founded in as a manufacturer of recreational vehicles  and became publicly held in the company currently only builds class a motorhomes on either gas or diesel chassis supplied by outside companies 
the company s products are positioned to be value leaders  in that its products offer many of the design and structural characteristics and quality components of high line motorhomes  but at a much more affordable price 
the last two years have been very challenging for the class a motorhome industry 
approximately  class a motorhomes were sold in  which was an all time high 
however  when the stock market started to slide in the spring of  class a motorhome sales dropped dramatically 
class a motorhome sales in dropped to  and dropped another in to  which is the lowest annual level since even though the operating results have been greatly influenced by this industry wide downturn  management knows there are significant opportunities for improvement  regardless of a recovery by the industry or not 
management will be focusing on improving the company s selling and marketing approaches  as well as generating operating efficiencies from better integration of production  engineering and purchasing 
the company s market share from to has been between and 
management expects this percentage to increase as it continues to enhance the features and benefits of its offerings  and continues to develop better dealer relations  especially east of the rocky mountains 
the company s year end order backlog of over million is an early indicator of an increase in demand for its products 
significant research and development expenditures of  and  in and  respectively  have been made to develop a new motorhome concept to be built on a chassis designed by the company 
the company plans to build a new plant in adjacent to its current facility in lancaster  ca  to produce both the new motorhome and the related chassis 
management believes the company s million of working capital is strong  which includes million in cash 
management expects operating cash flows to be sufficient to finance the company s production ramp up  operational improvement initiatives  product enhancements  and complete its research and development projects 
the company is also planning on minimal borrowings for the construction of the new plant  but business and market conditions might arise that make borrowing more prudent 
to counter the short term and long term effects of the bankruptcy of the company s largest dealer in  the company established its own retail operations in mesa  arizona  price i  inc dba  price one  rv 
under the terms of the repurchase agreements with the bankrupt dealer s lenders  while the company was only obligated to repurchase million of motorhomes  it elected to repurchase million in order to keep this inventory from being dumped on the market at substantially lower prices 
the retail operations at price one rv did not begin in earnest until november of as of december   the company had resold million of the repurchased inventory 
in december  the company ceased its retail operations  but continues to operate a service facility under the name rexhall service center arizona 
during december  the remaining price one inventory was sold to another dealership in arizona 
the company has reported the retail operations as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of inventory the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
adjustments to the value of inventory are recorded based upon damage  deterioration  obsolescence and changes in market value 
in determining market value  management has considered its current replacement cost ensuring it does not exceed net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and disposal 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering the order backlog and other factors in assessing estimated selling prices and made adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decrease in the net realizable value of inventory 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue primarily from the sale of motorhomes to dealers across the united states 
revenue is recognized when title of the motorhome transfers to the dealer 
this generally occurs upon shipment 
most dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with banks or other financing institutions under which the lender advances all  or substantially all  of the purchase price of the motorhome 
the loan is collateralized by a lien on the purchased motorhome 
as is customary in the industry  the company has entered into repurchase agreements with these lenders 
in general  the repurchase agreements provide that in the event of default by the dealer on its agreement to the lending institution  the company will repurchase the financed motorhome 
revenues are shown net of repurchases 
the company specifically reserves the gross margin for known repurchase obligations quarterly and at fiscal year end 
revenues are also generated from the service of motorhomes and from shipment or installation of parts and accessories 
legal accrual the company s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is accrued based on claims for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  management will assess the potential liability related to the pending litigation and revise the estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 
result of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the number of units shipped  net of repurchased units  decreased to in from in  a decrease of 
the average net selling price increased approximately during the period due to a higher mix of diesel units  partially offset by discounts offered in the th quarter of wholesale unit shipments of the company s gas motorhomes were down  while diesel motorhome unit shipments were up when compared to the same period in poor rv industry fundamentals of weakened consumer confidence and tightening of credit  continue to be the drivers of the overall downturn in the industry 
the events of september  only compounded this difficult market and added to the decline 
this led to an increase in dealer incentives and discounts to stimulate sales and reduce finished goods inventory 
management cannot determine when these conditions will improve  however  based on the company s year end order backlog  management believes market demand is strengthening 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the primary drivers of the decrease in gross profit were lower sales  higher discounts and incentives  and higher overhead costs absorbed by each unit 
the decrease in sales created a smaller absorption base for manufacturing overhead 
the nature of these costs is less variable than direct materials and labor  so overhead absorption suffers in periods of declining sales 
additionally  a  write down of finished goods inventory and a  write down of chassis inventory  were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  to properly reflect lower of cost or market inventory valuations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for and increased as a percentage of sales from to due to the decline in sales base and an increase in sg a expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in research and development  bad debt  and legal expenses partially offset by a reduction in officer s bonus and advertising 
other income primarily consisted of rental income on the sub leased portion of the company s facilities 
as of december   the company was no longer sub leasing any of its facilities 
the company s continuing operations effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared with for the decrease is a result of certain non deductible expenses being incurred in basic and diluted net income loss per share was for the year ended december   as compared to basic and diluted net income per share of in in december  the company ceased its retail operations  price one in mesa  arizona 
the retail inventory was discounted significantly and sold to another dealership in arizona 
the net results of the company s retail operations are presented in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations 
comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the number of units shipped  net of repurchased units  decreased to in from  in  a decrease of 
the average net selling price increased approximately during the period due to a higher mix of diesel units and units with double slides 
the decline in net revenues was primarily attributable to the first down market in years for class a motorhomes and the bankruptcy of the company s largest dealer 
the driver of the down turn in the market was declining consumer confidence since the stock market started dropping in march of this triggered a domino effect that led to a tightening of credit for retail dealers and consumers 
these conditions did not improve significantly in gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the decrease in sales created a smaller absorption base for manufacturing overhead  which was the primary driver behind the decrease in gross margin 
manufacturing overhead includes costs such as depreciation  indirect labor  shop supplies  utilities  insurance  etc 
the nature of these costs is less variable than materials and labor  so overhead absorption suffers in periods of quickly declining base 
management believes that prudent steps were taken to reduce these costs as market conditions dictated  and this small decline in gross margin compares favorably to the rest of the industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
this reduction was primarily attributed to lower warranty costs and management s quick reaction to market conditions by holding these costs down 
despite those actions  the reduction in sales caused sg a to increase as a percent of net revenues from in to in the company s continuing operations effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared with for the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes in basic and diluted net income per share was for the year ended december   as compared to basic and diluted net income per share of in liquidity and capital resources the company has relied primarily on internally generated funds  trade credit and debt to finance its operations and expansions 
as of december   the company had working capital of  compared to  at december   a  decrease in working capital  which is primarily attributable to the net cash flows of the discontinued retail operations 
significant working capital decreases are reflected in a  decrease in accounts receivable and a  decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase of  in cash 
capital expenditures during were  management anticipates a higher level of capital expenditures in cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of repayments of short term notes of  and the repurchase of stock on the open market of  management may continue to repurchase and or retire stock whenever business and market conditions are favorable to do so 
as of december  the company has a  line of credit with a bank which can be used for working capital purposes secured by equipment  inventory  and receivables 
the interest rate is the prime rate at december  
the line of credit expires september  under this line of credit   has been set aside as an irrevocable standby letter of credit for the company to meet the requirements for self insurance established by the department of industrial relations which regulates workers compensation insurance in california 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit contains various covenants 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at december  the company has a line of credit with a chassis vendor  ford motor credit company fmcc  with a  limit 
borrowings under the line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus at december  
all borrowings are secured by the ford merchandise 
the outstanding balance included at december  and was  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements through  including payments related to the expansion plans at the california facility  primarily with cash flows from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial total amounts less than after commitments outstanding year years years years lines of credit   total commercial commitments   the company s contingent liability under the repurchase agreements is limited to the total unpaid balance including  in some cases  interest and other charges owed to the lending institution by reason of its extension of credit to the dealer to purchase the company s motorhomes 
the contingent liability under repurchase agreements varies significantly from time to time  depending upon shipments and dealer sales to end users 
at december  and  the company s contingent liability was approximately  and  respectively 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and financing institutions and is further reduced by the resale value of any motorhomes that may be repurchased 
to date  the company s losses under these repurchase agreements have been minimal at the gross margin level  upon resale of the units

rexhall s business is seasonal and cyclical 
low interest rates  low unemployment  and ready availability of motor fuel have in the past been associated with favorable recreational vehicle sales as did occur in and acts of war and terrorism may have a negative effect on sales 
many of rexhall s competitors are substantially larger  and many of its suppliers and dealers also have greater economic power so that the volume and prices of both supplies and sales may be adversely affected by them 
management intends to remain aware of these factors and react to them  but cannot predict their timing or significance
