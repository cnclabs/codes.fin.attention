the acquisition provides a larger customer base and the ability to cross sell products to both north state and abatix customers 
the increase in net sales is also a result of the stable economic conditions in the geographic regions serviced by the company s facilities

liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements historically result from the growth of its accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  associated with increases in sales volume 
net cash used in operations during of  resulted principally from the increase in accounts receivable and inventories  net of the increase of net earnings adjusted for depreciation and amortization 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributed to higher sales in november and december versus cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be positive  although at any given point  it may be negative

in august  the company increased its working capital line of credit at a commercial lending institution from  to  to help fund additional working capital requirements due to higher sales 
the working capital line of credit agreement allows the company to borrow up to percent of the book value of eligible trade receivables plus the lesser of percent of eligible inventory or  as of march   there are advances outstanding under this credit facility of  based on the borrowing formula  the company had the capacity to borrow an additional  as of march  the company also maintains a  capital equipment credit facility providing for borrowings at percent of cost on purchases 
the advances outstanding under this credit facility as of march   were  both credit facilities are payable on demand and bear a variable rate of interest computed at the prime rate 
management believes the company s current credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event the company pursues additional acquisitions and is unable to use its common stock as payment  the company would need to negotiate with a lender to secure additional borrowings to be used to acquire another company s assets

critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain policies require the company to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions which are sensitive to deviations from actual results 
in particular  the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the use of long lived assets  including goodwill  in assessing potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
since there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  were impaired  the company recorded no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets 
the company does not expect events or circumstances to significantly change  thereby affecting the carrying value of long lived assets with the possible exception of the implementation of statement no 
in addition  the company has estimated the net realizable value of accounts receivable by evaluating the current pool of accounts receivable in light of past experience and current knowledge of its customer base 
the company believes the reserves recorded in the financial statements are adequate for potential credit losses 
it is possible the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time or if the health of the economy or the construction industry deteriorates 
finally  the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s working capital and equipment lines of credit are variable rate notes  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s debt at december  and  an increase of basis points in the united states prime rate would have negatively impacted the company s net earnings for the years then ended by  and  respectively 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this form k are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the long term impact of the september   tragic events on the commercial construction and domestic preparedness markets  the impact of insurance coverage on mold remediation jobs  adverse weather conditions  inability to hire and train quality people  changes in interest rates  unavailability of products and strong competition 
in addition  increases in oil prices or shortages in oil supply could significantly impact the company s petroleum based products and its ability to supply those products at a reasonable price 
furthermore  lack of acceptance of our e commerce solution or an impairment of goodwill resulting from the acquisitions could cause actual results to differ materially
