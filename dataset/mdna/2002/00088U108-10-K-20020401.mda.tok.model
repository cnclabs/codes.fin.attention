consumer appetite for health information continues to grow as shown by the dramatic increase in the number of searches conducted by consumers over the internet in the last three years 
today  more than million health seekers are online at least monthly  seeking information to manage their own conditions and the health of their family and friends 
health information technology in the new millenium  russell c 
coile  editor with this consumer demand  and the proliferation of patients taking an active role with their healthcare provider in their personal care management  the company believes that its products will play an increasing role in the product offerings of healthcare providers particularly hospitals  the pharmaceutical industry  and the health insurance and managed care industries 
these organizations are actively looking for ways to improve efficiencies  reduce clinical costs  increase patient encounters  communicate better with patients and plan members  and remain competitive in an environment that is increasingly becoming more crowded with direct to consumer marketing 
healthcare organizations must also deal with broader technical and compliancy issues such as hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act and other federal regulations that could have an impact on the usage of health content and patient education 
in addition  adam has recognized the important role its products can have with the growing us hispanic population 
with more than million spanish speaking consumers in the us  the company believes that there will be an increasing need to provide health information to this fast growing demographic segment 
new legislation requiring federally funded organizations  such as hospitals and other healthcare providers  to translate information into other languages for people with limited english proficiency  will fuel opportunities for spanish versions of adam s health information products 
adam completed the translation of its health illustrated encyclopedia  pregnancy health center and surgeries and procedures products in the company maintains a translation relationship with a third party vendor for editorial updates to the spanish products 
adam currently provides its health content products to a broad range of customers whose profile has shifted since the company began licensing its health content products in originally  the company s focus for licensed products was in the internet portal market 
at that time  healthcare organizations had not fully developed their web strategies and ebusiness initiatives that used health content as a significant driver 
while adam s sales and marketing focus is now more aligned to the healthcare market  the company still has active contracts with major internet portals and will continue to seek new opportunities in this market as they become available 
in the healthcare market  the company has developed a growing license business in the hospital  pharmaceutical and managed care areas

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company generates revenues mainly in two ways internet based licensing and shipped product sales 
internet revenues consist primarily of platform license fees that usually consist of an annual  up front charge that is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon customer acceptance 
revenues from licensing arrangements are recognized after delivery has occurred  when the company has determined that the fees from the agreement are fixed and determinable and there are no significant return or acceptance provisions 
fees billed in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as the services are performed 
payments  or installment invoices for licensing arrangements  received in advance of shipments are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the related software is shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
product revenues represent the sales of software products and revenues earned under certain royalty agreements 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized at the time title passes to customers  distributors or resellers 
revenues from royalty agreements are recognized as earned based upon performance or product shipment 
sales returns allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale 
the company evaluates the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon its evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes account receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize internal software development costs in accordance with financial and accounting standards board fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product shall be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of all planning  designing  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
we cease capitalization of internally developed software when the product is made available for general release to customers and thereafter  any maintenance and customer support is charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred 
we amortize such capitalized costs as cost of sales on a product by product basis using the straight line method over a period of two years 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized costs and if the successes of new product releases are less that we anticipate then a material write down of capitalized costs could adversely affect any reporting period in which the write down occurs 
we also capitalize internal software development costs in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement specifies that computer software development costs for computer software intended for internal use occurs in three stages the preliminary project stage  where costs are expensed as incurred  the application development stage  where costs are capitalized  and the post implementation or operation stage  where again costs are expense as incurred 
we cease capitalization of developed software for internal use when the software is ready for its intended use and placed in service 
we amortize such capitalized costs as cost of sales on a product by product basis using the straight line method over a period of three years 
we continually evaluate the usability of the products that make up our capitalized costs and if certain circumstances arise such as the introduction of new technology in the marketplace that management intends to use in place of the capitalized project  then a material write down of capitalized costs could adversely affect any reporting period in which the write down occurs 
inventory the company records reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
legal contingencies the company is subject to certain legal proceedings as discussed elsewhere in this report 
currently the company does not believe that these matters will have a material impact on its financial results or financial position 
this conclusion is based primarily on the company s insurance coverage for these matters 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances involving these legal matters 
goodwill and intangible assets as described in note to the consolidated financial statements the company has recorded goodwill in connection with its acquisition of imc in in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
we have applied sfas no 
in our allocation of the purchase price to the imc acquisition 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangibles that have an indefinite life are no longer to be amortized but are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
in assessing impairment the company must make judgments and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective net assets 
other factors that could cause impairment could result from a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge for the recorded goodwill 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the annual impairment review in however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
since the company did not have any goodwill recorded prior to the imc acquisition  the provision of sfas requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill will have no impact on the ongoing operating results of the company or the comparability of such results with prior periods 
variable stock options in march  the fasb issued financial interpretations no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

this opinion provides guidance on the accounting for certain stock option transactions and subsequent amendments to stock option transactions 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  we have from time to time since granted stock options to our employees to purchase shares of our common stock 
certain of these options were canceled at the option of their holders on january   and then replaced that day on a one for one basis with new options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price that day 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on adam s financial position or results of operations for calendar this interpretation requires variable accounting treatment for options that have been modified from their original terms 
accordingly  compensation cost shall be adjusted for increases or decreases in the intrinsic value of the modified awards in subsequent periods and until the awards have been exercised  forfeited  or expired 
as of december   the company has  outstanding options with an exercise price of that are considered variable under this interpretation 
because the stock price since the effective date of july  has been below  the company has not recorded any compensation cost related to the repriced options issued on january  should our stock price climb above our operating results will be affected until the stock options are either exercised or forfeited and could adversely affect any reporting period in which the variable accounting is required 
any charges that result from these variable options would be non cash operating expenses and will be reported on a separate line item 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas and sfas sfas is effective for any business combinations initiated after june   while sfas becomes effective for the company commencing january  sfas generally requires the company to use the purchase method to account for its acquisitions  if any 
the company does not believe that sfas will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
we have applied sfas no 
in our allocation of the purchase price to the imc acquisition 
sfas affects how the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in both previous and any future acquisitions 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions made after june  sfas also requires an impairment test on goodwill be performed at least annually beginning in the company will perform the impairment test during  the test is expected to be based on cash flow and earnings projections  and is not expected to result in an impairment charge 
since the company did not have any goodwill recorded prior to the imc acquisition  the provision of sfas requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill will have no impact on the ongoing operating results of the company or the comparability of such results with prior periods 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale 
the company must adopt this standard in the company is evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its results of operations and financial condition
