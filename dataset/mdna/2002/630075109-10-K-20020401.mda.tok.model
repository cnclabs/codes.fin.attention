overview it is our goal to become a leading provider of molecular diagnostic tests 
we integrate advanced microelectronics and molecular biology into a core technology platform with potentially broad and diverse commercial applications 
our primary areas of focus have been in genomics and biomedical research  medical diagnostics  forensics and drug discovery 
the first application we have developed  the nanochip system  is an integrated bioassay system consisting of the nanochip molecular biology workstation and the nanochip cartridge 
the nanochip workstation is comprised of two automated instruments and the nanochip cartridge  a consumable cartridge  which incorporates a proprietary microchip the nanochip electronic microarray 
the nanochip system provides a flexible tool for the rapid identification and precision analysis of biological test samples containing charged molecules 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses over at least the next few years as we attempt to further commercialize our products as well as expand the menu of applications for our current products 
we introduced our first two products into the marketplace in while we recognized revenue from product sales during the years ended december  and  our main sources of revenues during these fiscal years and in were payments under our sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants 
we believe that in future periods  however  our revenue base will shift to being more product driven as certain research collaboration agreements expire and new products are introduced to the marketplace 
we believe our future operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  market acceptance of the nanochip system and potential products under development  the type of acquisition program our potential customers may choose  whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us or our competitors  and the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements with hitachi and various government agencies 
the recognition of revenue under contracts  grants and sponsored research agreements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
the terms of our contracts and grants and sponsored research arrangements vary  but can generally be categorized as follows aventis development program in december  we entered into a letter agreement with aventis for an exclusive research and development collaboration relating to new drug discovery tools and immunodiagnostics research 
in connection with the letter agreement  we entered into a definitive collaborative research and development agreement with an effective date of january  all project milestones were completed and the term of this collaboration agreement expired at the end of in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with aventis that involved two research and development programs focused on gene expression tools utilizing electronic bioarrays and on the development of high throughput screening tools for protein kinase development 
we retained full commercialization rights for any products resulting from these new projects  while aventis retained the right to use the technology for internal research and development 
all project milestones established under these arrangements were completed as of fiscal year end at which time the agreements have expired 
under these programs  we demonstrated quantitative  multiplexed and reliable gene expression monitoring on our electronic microarray system 
additionally  we delivered an electronic hybridization based gene expression prototype detection system as well as a prototype system for analyzing protein kinases 
the protein kinase prototype system was sold during the fourth quarter of to an affiliate of aventis 
as of december   we had incurred an aggregate of million in direct and indirect research and development costs under these collaboration efforts 
we do not expect to receive additional funding for these projects 
hitachi development program in july  we entered into a ten year agreement with hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute products based on the parties proprietary technologies  potentially including  among other things  reduced size instruments for genetic testing  integrated amplification and point of care detection 
the arrangement provides that the parties will jointly determine which projects to prioritize over the term of the agreement 
hitachi has the right to be the exclusive distributor of collaboration products in japan and  based upon the attainment of minimum sales targets to be mutually agreed upon  in other asian countries 
we retain the exclusive right to distribute collaboration products outside of these countries 
either party  subject to certain restrictions  may terminate the agreement before its expiration 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  hitachi and the company each may contribute up to million in cash over the ten year period 
at a minimum the company is required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi 
the company received million  of which is a prepayment for research and development activities and million from hitachi during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company is liable to repay fifty percent of all funding provided by hitachi over an indefinite period of time 
payment amounts are determined as a percentage of the company s gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
the company has completed the identification of requirements phase of the project as of december  and anticipates completion of a prototype by the end of fiscal as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in research and development costs since the beginning of this project in july our failure to achieve established milestones under this collaboration could have a material adverse effect on funding available under this agreement  relations with hitachi and our business  financial condition or results of operations 
darpa grants in september  the company was awarded a contract by the space and naval warfare systems center san diego ssc san diego for the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in an amount totaling approximately million over a two year period 
the goal of the contract is to develop and refine electronically driven sample preparation protocols on specifically designed microelectronic chips 
the contract was completed in january and all milestones have been achieved 
in august  a second darpa contract was granted to nanogen in an amount totaling approximately million over a two year period 
the contract is focused on developing an electronic sample preparation chip for the detection of biowarfare agents from blood samples 
the project is on schedule to meet all contractual milestones and is expected to be completed mid as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in direct and indirect research and development costs since the beginning of these contracts 
usamraa cooperative agreements the company received funding from two cooperative research agreements with the us army medical research acquisition activity 
the first agreement  entered into in october  is focused on developing technology to identify biological warfare compounds if used in combat against us troops 
the second cooperative agreement  entered into in october  is to continue the development of miniaturized electronic devices for isolation and detection of biological warfare and infectious disease agents 
in conjunction with the agreements  funding provided by the agency is matched dollar for dollar with nanogen funds 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of  in direct and indirect research and development costs since the beginning of these collaboration efforts 
nij grant the national institute of justice  us department of justice  provides funding for the development of a chip based genetic detector for rapid dna based identification of individuals 
all milestones contemplated under phase iv  the penultimate phase of this multi year grant  are expected to be complete in mid as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of million in direct research and development costs since the beginning of this multi year grant 
an application has been submitted for funding of final phase v 
if awarded  phase v efforts could result in protocols and reagents suitable for beta testing in crime labs 
while the majority of the company s total revenues during fiscal  and consisted of sponsored research and contract and grant funding  there was an increase in product revenues for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  the year we launched our first products 
the makeup of our revenues is shifting from primarily sponsored research funding to product revenues as sales and marketing efforts increase the installed base of our nanochip molecular biology workstation and as programs from research and development collaborations expire 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
one of these acquisition programs is through development site agreements  where title does not pass to the customer  however  these agreements may provide for the potential development of content for use on the nanochip system 
as internal and external content development expand the capabilities of the nanochip system  the company believes that consumable sales  including nanochip cartridge sales and eventually analytic specific reagents asr s and food and drug administration fda cleared or approved kits will account for an increasing portion of our product revenues 
during the fiscal year  the company internally and externally validated its first five dna based research protocols for use on the nanochip molecular biology workstation 
four of these protocols are associated with cardiovascular disease and the pathology of thrombosis 
they include factor v leiden  factor ii prothrombin  a multiplexed protocol for both of these mutations at a single location on our microarray  and mthfr 
the fifth protocol is for a mutation associated with hereditary hemochromotosis  a disorder that causes excess iron to be stored in cells of the liver  heart  pancreas and other organs 
we believe high complexity clia certified laboratories that adopt our technology may further validate these protocols in their own laboratories for use in a home brew format 
during  we plan to convert certain of these protocols into asr s 
under the asr model we will continue to sell blank cartridges in addition to the reagents necessary to perform these tests on the nanochip system 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgements  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  service obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from the sale of nanochip molecular biology workstations and of nanochip cartridges is generally recognized upon shipment and transfer of title 
in transactions where a right of return exists  revenue is deferred until acceptance has occurred and the period for the right of return has lapsed 
the nanochip molecular biology workstation is generally sold with a one year maintenance contract 
the fair value of the maintenance service is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period earned 
we provide for the estimated cost of product maintenance at the time revenue is recognized 
we also recognize revenue from the sale of our nanochip system under reagent rental transactions whereby customers pay to either a financing company or directly to us  higher prices for our consumable cartridges over a number of years to cover the cost of the system 
under these arrangements  the customer typically commits to purchasing a fixed number of consumable cartridges on a periodic basis  which in turn represents payment under the reagent rental agreement 
revenue under reagent rental transactions is recognized in line with scheduled payments over the term of the agreement  generally two to five years 
we also offer our nanochip molecular biology workstations to customers under programs  such as development site arrangements  where title of the product does not transfer to the customer 
sales under these types of programs do not result in the recognition of revenue 
sales revenue is subject to fluctuation due to the type of acquisition program our customers may choose 
sponsored research and contract and grant revenue are generally recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred 
under certain arrangements revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement as funding is provided for contractually on a scheduled basis 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
continuation of certain sponsored research and contracts and grants are dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory we reduce the carrying value of our inventory  including nanochip molecular biology workstations placed under development site arrangements  for estimated obsolescence or non marketability based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to acquired technology rights 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for the year ended december   sales revenue totaled million compared to  for the year ended december  sales revenue primarily consists of revenue recognized from the sale of our nanochip molecular biology workstations and nanochip cartridges 
we sold fifteen  and recognized revenue for thirteen  nanochip systems during compared to eight nanochip systems in in addition  we sold two nanochip systems in both and under sponsored research programs 
all revenue recorded related to sales of our nanochip molecular biology workstation resulted from outright sales transactions where title of the instrument passed to the customer 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
as of december   we had an installed base of instruments  which consist of twenty seven outright sales and thirty four placements under non title transfer transactions 
our sales revenue may vary from year to year due to  among other things  the types of acquisition programs our potential customers may choose 
for the year ended december   revenue from sponsored research totaled million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sponsored research revenue in included the following revenue earned in connection with our research and development agreement entered into in january and september with aventis totaling million  which includes the sale of two nanochip molecular biology workstations 
revenue earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi totaling million 
sponsored research revenue for the same period in and included the following revenue earned in connection with our research and development agreements entered into in january and september with aventis totaling million in  which includes the sale of two nanochip molecular biology workstations  and million in revenue earned in connection with the joint venture agreement with becton dickinson  as amended in september  totaling  in and million in revenue earned in connection with our development program entered into in july with hitachi totaling  in revenue earned in connection with our nonexclusive research and development agreement with lan totaling  in all project milestones established under the research and development agreement entered into in september with aventis were completed as of fiscal year end at which time the agreements have expired 
we do not expect to receive additional funding from aventis  becton dickinson and lan under the projects mentioned above 
we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal agencies 
revenues are recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
continuation of sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants is dependent upon us achieving specific contractual milestones 
the recognition of revenue under sponsored research agreements and contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
cost of sales and gross margins cost of sales totaled million in compared to  in there were no product sales in gross margins on sales revenue were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of sales during the years ended december  and were adversely impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs due to underutilized capacity 
the cost per unit of our products remained high  as our volume of production relative to the available capacity remained low 
in  cost of sales was further impacted by a reserve for obsolete inventory 
gross margins in were also unfavorably impacted by sales to some customers under various discount programs 
in comparison  during the year ended december   a portion of sales revenue related to prototypes and therefore did not have the related cost of sales recorded in the period sold as these costs had been expensed as research and development costs in prior years 
as we are still in the early stages of commercialization  we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facility in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses included the following in costs of salaries and benefits for scientific  engineering and operations personnel  costs associated with improving and refining our current products as well as development of potential new products and protocols  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  and other expenditures associated with our research and product development activities 
the number of personnel directly working in research and development related activities  within our us operations decreased by approximately in from  primarily as a result of a reallocation of personnel to operations 
the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal to resulted primarily from the different development stages of our nanochip molecular biology workstation from period to period 
during the year ended december   our nanochip molecular biology workstation was in an advanced stage of prototype design and development 
in comparison  during the year ended december   many costs associated with the manufacturing of the workstation were absorbed by our manufacturing partner  hitachi  ltd 
research and development expenses during and included the following costs of salaries and benefits for scientific  engineering and operations personnel  product design and prototype development costs  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  and other expenditures associated with our research and product development activities 
expenditures incurred both internally and with outside vendors related to engineering prototypes  as well as other costs associated with testing and refining the product in we anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and product development at approximately the same level as for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the year to year increases from through are primarily due to costs associated with the expansion and development of our sales and marketing organization  the expansion of activities related to marketing and selling our products  and increased legal fees associated with enhancing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue at the current level for the forseeable future as we continue to market and sell our current and potential future products 
litigation and settlement of patent matter litigation and settlement of a patent matter totaled million for the year ended december  in july  a settlement agreement was reached with motorola  inc  genometrix  inc 
and the massachusetts institute of technology concluding the declaratory judgment action by us against motorola  genometrix and mit as well as motorola s counterclaim against us 
in connection with the settlement  we paid a total of million to the parties in the form of million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million based upon a per share price of  the fair market value on the date of settlement 
costs incurred during the year primarily consist of the settlement fee of million in addition to legal fees incurred related to the litigation process 
interest income  net we had net interest income of million in compared to net interest income of million and million  in and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income is a result of lower average cash balances as well as lower yields on outstanding cash balances during when compared to the significant increase in when compared to can be primarily attributed to higher average cash balances in resulting from net proceeds received in conjunction with our follow on public offering of common stock in march other income other income totaled  for the year ended december  other income primarily consists of a gain realized from the sale of short term investments during the year 
equity in loss of joint venture we recognized a loss of  for the year ended december   from the joint venture formed in with becton dickinson  based on the loss allocation described in the partnership agreement which requires losses to be allocated in proportion to and not to exceed required cash contributions 
there was no loss recognized during and as no cash contributions were required to be made by us to the joint venture during those periods 
in september  we and becton dickinson modified the joint venture to  among other things  permit the partners the opportunity to commercialize certain of the partnership s technology and to allow them to collaborate with third parties in developing and commercializing certain products and technologies 
we do not expect any additional funding to the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to cash used in operations of approximately million offset by million in proceeds provided by aventis for the operations of our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used for operations during and was primarily related to costs associated with commercializing our products including the expansion  development and support of our sales and marketing organization  the procurement of inventory pursuant to our manufacturing arrangement with hitachi  ltd  support of our continuing research and development efforts  legal fees relating to establishing  maintaining and defending our intellectual property portfolio  and the costs associated with patent litigation 
cash used for operations during was primarily related to the costs associated with developing prototypes of our initial product  the support of our expanding operations  including higher personnel costs  and legal fees relating to establishing and maintaining our intellectual property rights 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities during and primarily related to the purchase of short term securities in an effort to maximize our return while preserving our cash balance 
during the year ended december   we paid million to acquire rights to technologies in order to enable us to further develop and commercialize our products 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to the funds totaling million provided by aventis for the operations of nanogen recognomics as well as funding provided by hitachi under the july research and development agreement 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to proceeds received pursuant to our follow on public offering of common stock in march net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily related to payments under our capital lease obligations 
we fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements through capital leasing facilities 
during  equipment and leasehold improvement financing funded million  compared to  and  of equipment acquired during and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to use capital equipment leasing or debt facilities to fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we had million of available funding under our equipment lease lines 
the following illustrates  on a comprehensive basis  all recorded liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as included herein and contractual commitments associated with operating leases  purchase commitments and funding commitments under research and development collaborations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations other commitments total less than year years years thereafter capital lease obligations    other long term liabilities a   operating leases     purchase commitments b    research and development funding commitments c   standby letters of credit d total contractual obligations other commitments   a in connection with the agreement entered into with hitachi in july  we are required to repay fifty percent of the total contributions made by hitachi 
payment amounts are determined as a percentage of our gross nanochip cartridge sales until the liability is paid in full 
this liability is non interest bearing and will survive any termination of the agreement among the parties until it is paid 
we have received a total of million since july under this arrangement 
other long term liabilities also reflects our obligation under an employee pension plan established by our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics 
b our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi requires that we provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for nanochip workstations 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million in nanochip workstations through march  the requirement of future purchase commitments will be determined based on product demand and inventory levels 
in connection with the service agreement established with hitachi in october  as amended in december  we have committed to provide hitachi with a minimum of  in payments for maintenance service provided in fiscal c we are required to contribute on an annual basis funding for its own general technology development in an amount equal to or greater than payments made by hitachi under the research and development agreement established in july amounts included in the table above assume hitachi will make all scheduled payments under this arrangement totaling million since inception of the agreement in fiscal in connection with the formation of nanogen recognomics in fiscal  we are required to spend an aggregate of million  at a rate of million per year beginning april   for its own general technology development which benefits the commercialization and development of potential nanogen recognomics products 
d payments are not required under the standby letters of credit and expire at various dates and therefore the table above does not reflect payment information over the five year period 
the company is a party to development site agreements with various entities whereby the company may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any nanogen commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 
we expect that our existing capital resources  combined with anticipated revenues from potential product sales  reagent rentals  leases or other types of acquisition programs for the nanochip system  sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants will be sufficient to support our planned operations through at least the next two years at our fiscal rate of expenditures 
this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  commercial success of our products  or lack thereof  of our current products  the extent to which our products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business and any litigation related thereto  the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  or r d  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and state nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized  and the state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and state r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may be perceived as a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
we also experienced a change of ownership in and as such  we may be limited in the amount of nols incurred prior to our initial public offering  which may be utilized to offset future taxable income 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations will have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols 
see note of notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities that are typically held for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
recent downgrading of issuers of such securities we believe  have had no material impact on our investment portfolio 
the functional currency for our netherlands and german subsidiaries is the us dollar and euro  respectively 
the german subsidiary s accounts are translated from the euro to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in certain instances  our subsidiaries conduct business with customers and vendors in euros or in other local european currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our european customers and vendors 
the net tangible assets of our subsidiaries  excluding intercompany balances  is million at december
