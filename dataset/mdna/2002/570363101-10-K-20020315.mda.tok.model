overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using oil tankers  tank barges and tugboats to provide marine transportation services primarily along the gulf and atlantic coasts of the united states 
between and  the company has transported at least million barrels annually  with a high of million barrels in  and a low of million barrels in maritrans sold vessels in resulting in a reduction in capacity 
in and  the company has transported million and million barrels  respectively 
many factors affect the number of barrels transported and may affect future results for maritrans 
such factors include the company s vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies operating and sourcing decisions  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
in  the company made several strategic moves in order to focus on those markets where it believes it possesses a long term competitive advantage and that should provide additional opportunities 
as a result  the company sold two small tug and barge units  which were working in puerto rico  two petroleum storage terminals in philadelphia  pennsylvania and salisbury  maryland  and twenty seven vessels working primarily in the northeastern united states 
before their sales  the sold vessels had transported approximately million barrels in and had represented approximately percent of revenues 
maritrans has successfully rebuilt three of its existing  single hulled  barges to a double hull design configuration  which complies with the provisions of the opa 
the maritrans  a  barrel barge was completed in  the maritrans  a  barrel barge was completed in and the maritrans formerly the ocean cities  a  barrel barge was completed in prefabrication has already commenced on a fourth single hull barge  the ocean that is scheduled to enter the shipyard in the spring of the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to five more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hull barges 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
legislation opa requires all newly constructed petroleum tank vessels engaged in marine transportation of oil and petroleum products in the us to be double hulled 
it also gradually phases out the operation of single hulled tank vessels in us waters  based on size and age  which includes most of maritrans existing barges 
three of the company s large oceangoing  single hulled barges will be affected on january  currently five of the company s barges and two tankers are equipped with double hulls meeting opa s requirements 
maritrans is in the midst of a barge rebuild program 
under the program  the company s single hull tank barges are rebuilt to comply with opa 
this rebuilding of the single hull barges relies upon a process of computer assisted design and prefabrication 
in january  the company was granted a patent for this process 
the first rebuilt barge  the maritrans  was completed and entered service in november the second rebuilt barge  the maritrans  was completed and entered service in december the third rebuilt barge  the maritrans formerly the ocean cities  was completed and entered service in february work has already commenced on a fourth single hull barge  the ocean  which is scheduled to enter the shipyard in the spring of it is the company s intention to rebuild all of its single hulled barges prior to their respective retirement dates 
the cost of rebuilding single hull barges is approximately per barrel compared to estimated costs of approximately per barrel for construction of a completely new double hull barge 
the total cost of the barge rebuild program is expected to exceed million of which approximately million has already been incurred 
in  the company extensively refurbished the tugboat that works with the maritrans at a cost of approximately million 
the company also plans to refurbish the tugboat that works with the ocean during the time that the ocean is undergoing her double hull rebuilding and plans to continue this tug refurbishment process during future barge rebuilds 
the enactment of opa significantly increased the liability exposure of marine transporters of petroleum in the event of an oil spill 
in addition  several states in which maritrans operates have enacted legislation increasing the liability for oil spills in their waters 
the company currently maintains oil pollution liability insurance of up to one billion dollars per occurrence on each of its vessels 
although liability exceeding the company s insurance coverage amount is possible  management believes that such liability is unlikely and that such insurance is sufficient to cover forseeable oil pollution liability arising from its operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for of million were consistent with revenues for of million 
vessel utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  decreased from percent in to percent in utilization decreased due to more vessel out of service time for maintenance in compared to in  the maritrans was out of service for nine months for her double hull rebuild 
the maritrans went out of service for her double hull rebuild late in the second quarter of and re entered service early in february as a result  the fleet lost less days to double hull rebuilding in than in  offsetting the maintenance out of service time 
term contract rates renewed with customers in were renewed at higher levels than those experienced in the increase in these rates resulted from a more stable supply demand relationship in the jones act trade 
these rate increases will have a positive effect on revenue 
spot market rates fluctuated greatly in  and overall were slightly higher than in in the first half of the year  spot rates were significantly higher than the same period in due to increased distillate demand and the restocking of inventory balances 
in the third quarter  spot rates dropped as a result of refinery maintenance projects and less demand for refined products 
in addition  there was a general downturn in the economy  which continued through the end of the year 
in the fourth quarter  spot rates declined to below levels for the comparable period 
the terrorists attacks on september th worsened the downturn in the economy 
as a result  gasoline inventories grew and the demand for jet fuel decreased 
in addition  warm weather in the northeast reduced the demand for heating oil 
the company expects spot rates in the first and second quarters of will be below the fourth quarter rates due to continuing weak demand for products 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in to million in  due to decreases in demand during the year 
total costs and operating expenses for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
the primary decreases in operating expenses were in voyage costs  which are primarily fuel consumed and port charges incurred 
in more of the company s tankers were under contracts that pass all fuel and other voyage costs directly to the customer than in  resulting in a decrease in expenses 
the downturn in the economy in  discussed above  also reduced fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of fuel decreased percent compared to the decrease in utilization  discussed above  also caused port charges and fuel costs to decrease compared to the same period in offsetting these decreases was an increase in crew costs 
in  a higher volume of seminars and training took place than in routine maintenance increased during as a result of a higher number of vessel repairs 
other maintenance expenses decreased due to the extensive renewals and refurbishments that occur during the rebuilding of the single hulled barges to double hulled barges 
in  the company had incurred million in relocation costs as a result of moving the corporate headquarters from philadelphia  pennsylvania to tampa  florida  which were not incurred in operating income increased from million in to million in  as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
other income in included interest income of million and a gain of million on the sale of a barge 
other income in included interest income of million offset by a loss of million on the sale of philadelphia real estate and equipment 
interest income decreased due to a lower amount of cash invested in compared to the extraordinary loss of million  net of taxes  resulted from prepayment penalties and the write off of unamortized financing costs on the prepayment of the company s fleet mortgage 
net income increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
although revenue in decreased million as a result of the sale of thirty one vessels and the petroleum storage terminals in  revenue for the remaining fleet for the comparable periods increased million 
this revenue increase resulted primarily from increases in the average daily rates charged to customers  which occurred later in and to increased fuel costs  discussed in operating expenses below  much of which the company was able to pass through to customers under its contractual agreements 
the increase in average daily rates over the comparable period in was due primarily to the amount of capacity already under contract to major oil companies and to low distillate inventories in the united states  particularly heating oil in the northeast 
both factors have raised rates for available jones act capacity 
the company expects the strong market rates to continue for several quarters and to have a positive impact on revenue 
vessel utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  decreased from percent in to percent in for the comparable fleet 
the overall decrease was the result of the maritrans being out of service for nine months in  for its double hull rebuild 
excluding the maritrans  utilization for the operating vessels was percent  which was moderately higher than s utilization of percent for the comparable fleet 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in to million in  due to the smaller fleet 
total costs and operating expenses for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the sale of assets discussed above 
in addition  shoreside related expenses decreased as a result of the reduction in shoreside staff in in september  the company recorded a severance charge of million for these employees  which was paid in maintenance expense decreased due to the reduction in fleet size and the impact of the rebuilding of the single hulled barges to double hulled barges  which allows certain maintenance procedures to be performed while the vessel is in the shipyard for its double hulling 
offsetting these decreases in operating expenses was an increase in fuel expense for fuel used on the vessels 
in  the average fuel rate increased compared to based on market expectations of oil prices continuing at or above per barrel  the company believes that its fuel costs will continue at rates higher than those in for the next several quarters 
some of this increase in fuel costs was passed through to customers under contractual agreements and will continue to be passed on in in  the company incurred million in relocation costs for the move of the corporate headquarters from philadelphia  pa to tampa  fl in the spring of operating income increased from million in to million in  as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
interest income consisted of interest earned on investments  which increased primarily due to the proceeds generated on the sales of assets in other income included a loss on the sale of philadelphia real estate and equipment of million 
other income for the year ended december  included a gain of million on the disposition of vessels and petroleum storage terminals 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of state taxes on certain asset sales in net income for the twelve months ended december   decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
net income for included million  net of tax  from the gain on the sale of assets 
liquidity and capital resources in  funds provided by operating activities were sufficient to meet debt service obligations and loan agreement restrictions  to make capital acquisitions and improvements and to allow maritrans inc to pay a dividend in each quarter of the year 
while dividends have been made quarterly in each of the last three years  there can be no assurances that the dividend will continue 
the ratio of total debt to capitalization is

maintenance and repairs provision is made for the cost of upcoming major periodic overhauls of vessels and equipment in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs 
the current portion of this estimated cost is included in accrued shipyard costs while the portion of this estimated cost not expected to be incurred within one year is classified as long term 
although the shipyard costs have fluctuated  particularly as a result of changes in the size of the fleet  the provision has been in line with the actual disbursements over time 
the company believes that providing for such overhauls in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs provides a more appropriate view of the financial position of the company at any point in time 
in june  the aicpa issued an exposure draft on a proposed statement of position regarding accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
the proposed statement  if issued  would require the company to modify its accounting policy for maintenance and repairs 
such costs would no longer be accrued in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs  rather  the proposed statement would require these costs to be capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting this new pronouncement on its financial statements  however  the company s preliminary assessment is that the adoption of this pronouncement would increase the value of vessels and equipment and stockholders equity of the company
