item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data  which are included in this document 
description of financial information impark resulted from the combination on march  of the parking related businesses of fumi and the canadian parking facilities of first union 
a brief description of the operations of each business combined is as follows fumi parking business 
the fumi parking business consisted of the parking services and related ancillary activities that we acquired on march  from april to march  subsidiaries of fumi carried on these activities 
the operations of fumi s indirect subsidiaries  imperial parking limited and impark services ltd  consisted of operating and managing parking facilities in canada and the united states and carrying on other parking related activities 
fur parking business 
the fur parking business consisted primarily of owning parking properties in canada 
from april to march  subsidiaries of first union operated this business  including leasing the properties to fumi for operation and management 
periods presented 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and combine the results of the fumi parking business and the fur parking business on a pro forma basis as if the march  transactions had been completed at the commencement of the earliest of the periods presented 
we have presented the information in this manner to assist the reader  as we believe it is the most meaningful way to consider and evaluate the company in its current form 
in doing this we are not indicating what the results of operations would actually have been if the businesses had been combined on those dates 
overview we operate parking facilities under leases  management contracts  and fee ownership 
these three types of arrangements are discussed further in this report under item business 
revenues consist of parking revenues from leased and owned facilities  and revenues earned in accordance with the terms of management contracts 
the following table sets out the pro forma revenues earned from each of the three operating arrangements for each of the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands leased facilities managed facilities owned facilities total the number of facilities operated as at each fiscal year end under each of these arrangements is as follows as at december  leased facilities managed facilities owned facilities results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was due largely to an increase in revenue on leased facilities  and from including the results for dlc which was acquired effective july  revenues from leased facilities for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
million of this increase was in the united states and resulted from starting operations in san francisco april  cleveland september and atlanta august and the acquisition of both e z park in cincinnati april and dlc in philadelphia july 
the increase of million in leased revenue in canada included a recovery of million related to our settlement of a dispute over direct taxes on parking violation revenue 
fiscal included a reduction of revenue of million based on estimates of our tax liability at the time 
during fiscal  we were successful in recovering million during fiscal of the amount previously provided 
we do not expect any further benefits in the future from settling this tax liability 
the remainder of the increase in canada of million was due in part  to parking rate increases and a public transit strike in calgary  alberta and vancouver  bc management contract revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal an increase of million  or 
the increase was solely attributable to the acquired dlc contracts 
direct costs in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
of this increase  million was from dlc s operations  million was attributable to higher rent expense  and million to other directs costs 
rent expense increased million  or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal rent as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is principally due to the leases in our new us operations being in the early phase of their terms 
as we continue to operate these new leased facilities  we would expect revenue growth to exceed any growth in rent and  therefore  rent as a percentage of revenue would decline 
the increase in other direct costs of million  or  from million to million  is due to the general increase in revenues 
direct costs as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is due  in part  to the acquisition of dlc  which added million of general and administrative expenses  and expansion since last year in the united states  including million for operations in san francisco  cincinnati  cleveland  and atlanta and million to establish a regional management infrastructure in the united states 
we also incurred million of additional expense related to being a public company and million of increased stock compensation expense  as discussed below 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal included in general and administrative expense is stock based compensation expense for fiscal of million which includes an allocation of both senior management s compensation related to our stock performance and directors annual stock entitlement for services rendered 
in fiscal there was million of stock based compensation for stock awarded to directors  but no stock compensation expense for senior management 
the allocation for senior management s compensation is based on the stock incentive plan which was approved by the stockholders at our annual general meeting 
the plan includes variable stock options whereby the exercise price of the options increases during the term of the options 
accordingly  any change in the intrinsic value of the options is reflected as a compensation expense on a quarterly basis 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in these amounts is goodwill amortization of million for fiscal and million for fiscal with the adoption of the financial accounting statement no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized effective fiscal onwards 
however  the carrying value of goodwill will be subject to a regular impairment test 
the equity share in the limited liability company llc losses represents our share in nine llc s which each operate a parking facility in new york  new york 
the llc s started operating these facilities in fiscal interest income of million was earned in fiscal compared to million in fiscal although the interest income in was earned during only a period of nine months from the combination in march  interest rates in were higher by approximately 
interest expense of million for fiscal represents interest on the bank loan to finance the acquisition of dlc and imputed interest on the portion of the purchase price that is deferred 
income tax expense for fiscal includes our current tax liability for capital and state taxes  and a deferred tax expense as we utilize our net operating losses for tax purposes in canada 
the deferred tax expense has been reduced by a deferred tax recovery for operating losses in the us for fiscal the effect of offsetting losses in the us at lower tax rates against profits in canada at higher tax rates is to increase the effective tax rate for accounting purposes to on a consolidated basis for fiscal there was no corresponding deferred tax expense in fiscal  as we had not then recognized the canadian tax losses for accounting purposes 
net earnings for fiscal were million a decrease of million from the fiscal pro forma earnings of million 
this decrease is primarily due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses  equity losses of million in the llc s  lower net interest income of million  and higher income tax expense of million  offset by a higher gross margin of million and lower depreciation and amortization expense of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues  on a pro forma basis  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to greater revenues from leased facilities as detailed below 
pro forma revenues from leased facilities for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily a result of commencing operations in san francisco in february  and specifically the opening of the pacific bell baseball stadium in april  which contributed million in lease revenue 
the acquisition in april of ten leased facilities upon the purchase of e z park and subsequent organic growth in cincinnati  also generated million of additional lease revenue in fiscal a further million of additional lease revenue was generated in fiscal from converting a significant urban mid west us parkade in december from a management contract to a lease 
these increases were offset by the sales in of the robbins parking and asian divisions which had generated million of lease revenue in pro forma revenues from management contracts for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase is attributed to organic growth and increased management fees on existing locations of million offset by the sales in of the robbins parking and asian operations which had generated million of management contract revenue in pro forma direct costs in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was attributable to higher rent expense from the start of operations in san francisco  the acquisition of e z park and the conversion of the urban mid west us parkade to a lease arrangement 
rent expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
rent as a percentage of revenues  excluding robbins and asia  increased from to for fiscal and  respectively 
offsetting this increase in direct costs was the effect of the sales in of the robbins and asian operations which incurred million of direct costs in fiscal an increase of million in other operating expenses related to the increase in lease revenue accounted for the remaining change in direct costs for fiscal over fiscal direct costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal pro forma general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal expenses in included an adjustment for an employee severance provision accrued in  but which was determined to be over accrued by million and reversed in also included additional severance of million and million related to the robbins and asian operations sold in excluding these three items  general and administrative expenses for were million 
the increase in over includes million related to growth in new cities cincinnati  san francisco  cleveland and new york and million of compensation expense for shares and options issued to directors and management in general and administrative expenses  excluding severance  as a percentage of pro forma total revenues decreased to for the fiscal compared to for fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  as a result of the full amortization of certain management and lease agreements which are amortized over the term of the agreements 
in fiscal  other income of million reflects interest earned on cash balances and other investments of million partially offset by corporate tax expense of million 
no interest income was recorded in the pro forma results 
the provision for deferred income taxes  including million for non deductible goodwill amortization  would have been million higher for fiscal  except for credit of million for the change in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset representing loss carry forwards in canada 
the valuation allowance at december  is million and largely represents the expectation that the losses will be utilized at rates lower than currently in effect 
pro forma net earnings for fiscal were million an increase of million from the million loss for fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased gross margin of million  lower other operating expenses of million  and higher other income of million offset by the reversal in of over accrued severance of million 
liquidity and capital resources as at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this represents an increase of million during fiscal the increase resulted from million of cash generated from operations and million of funds drawn under our credit facility to finance the acquisition of dlc 
these cash inflows were offset by million used to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of dlc  million used in other investing activities  million used to repurchase our stock and million of changes in exchange rates on cash balances 
million of the cash from operations was generated by using a letter of credit to replace and release the restricted cash previously on short term deposit to support a lien bond issued in conjunction with negotiating final costs of the san francisco giants parking development 
we are negotiating final costs with the contractor of the san francisco giants parking development 
the contractor is claiming costs and damages of million 
we believe that our potential liability is significantly less than the amount claimed 
also  we sublease the related parking lots from the china basin ballpark company llc cbbc and cbbc is required to share in any cost overruns 
an accrual has been recorded at december  for the estimated settlement costs 
at december  we had million of bank debt outstanding 
after borrowing these funds and using million for outstanding letters of credit  we have million remaining of a million credit facility with hsbc bank canada to fund working capital requirements  acquisitions and other capital investment opportunities 
in the next months  we anticipate the working capital necessary to satisfy current obligations will be generated from operations  available cash  and our bank facility 
in the future  if we identify investment opportunities requiring cash in excess of operating cash flows and credit facilities  we may seek additional sources of capital  including the sale or issuance of our common stock or a rights offering  or amending our credit facility to obtain additional indebtedness 
no assurances can be given that such increases would be available at the time needed to complete any such transaction 
future cash commitments the following tables summarize our total contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years bank indebtedness operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash payments the bank indebtedness has been reflected as payable within one year as it is repayable on demand 
however  it is currently being repaid in blended monthly instalments of principal and interest of  through december amount of commitment expiration per period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years standby letters of credit total commercial commitments critical accounting policies impark is involved in the ownership  management and operation of parking facilities in the united states and canada 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  estimates and judgments are applied that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
on an on going basis  we evaluate areas of estimate or judgment to ensure they reflect currently available assessments and knowledge 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates 
the consolidated financial statements reflect goodwill  management agreements and fixed assets arising from historical transactions 
in assessing the underlying value of these assets  we consider estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the assets over their estimated useful life 
various factors  including customer demand  weather  transit use and government policies  could change thereby impacting these estimates  possibly materially 
these factors are substantially outside of our control 
the consolidated financial statements reflect deferred income tax assets based on our assessment that we are more likely than not to be able to utilize certain deductions in the future  primarily loss carry forwards 
our assessment is based on a judgment of taxable income before such deductions in changes in the timing of the recognition and amount of revenues and expenses in the future may impact our ability to utilize these deductions 
under the terms of the agreement to acquire dlc  we are required to make annual payments to the former shareholders of dlc for each of the twelve month periods ending june  through the payments are calculated relative to the actual operating results of the acquired business in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
each twelve month period calculation is independent and separable from each other twelve month period calculation 
in making this calculation  a multiple of is applied to each future twelve month period s ebitda less depreciation of any new capital expenditure on the acquired parking facilities  and one tenth of that amount is payable in cash at that time 
at december  we estimated this liability  based on operating results of the acquired business for  to be approximately million per annum for each of the periods through june  we have accrued for this amount in our consolidated financial statements as at december  the actual amount to be paid for any given year may differ significantly from our estimate as it depends on the actual operating performance of dlc and is not subject to any limit 
however  the former shareholders of dlc are required to make up any shortfall  up to  in the ebitda of the acquired business below million for any of the twelve month periods through june  as discussed in further detail in item legal proceedings  we are negotiating final costs with the contractor of the san francisco giants parking development 
the contractor is claiming costs and damages of million 
we believe that our potential liability is significantly less than the amount claimed 
also  we sublease the related parking lots from the china basin ballpark company llc cbbc and cbbc is required to share in any cost overruns 
we have recorded an accrual at december  for our estimate of the settlement costs 
if the final settlement exceeds the amount accrued  depreciation of our share of the development costs would increase 
we recorded million in related to depreciation of our share of development costs 
new accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board announced new rules related to the accounting for goodwill 
financial accounting statement no 
 business combinations sfas eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations and is effective for all transactions initiated after june  the acquisition described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item a of this report has been accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with sfas financial accounting statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but the carrying value of goodwill will be subject to a regular impairment test 
sfas is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  except to the extent that it relates to acquisitions after june  the effect on the financial statements of the company is that amortization of existing goodwill will cease as of december  goodwill resulting from the acquisition described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
the company s goodwill amounts at december  for acquisitions that occurred prior to july  will be subject to the annual impairment test on an ongoing basis commencing with adoption on january  due to the extensive effort required to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in we anticipate completing our preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adopting sfas  if any  by june  in october  the board issued financial accounting statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas  the fundamental recognition and measurement principles of sfas for assets to be held and used  and the fundamental measurement principles for assets to be held for sale  are retained 
under sfas  an asset to be sold would be classified as held for sale in the period when the criteria for a qualifying plan of sale are met  and depreciation would cease at that time 
the statement also addresses assets that will be disposed of other than by sale eg  abandonment  and will require that they be classified as held and used until the entity disposes of the asset or ceases to use it in the case of abandonment 
the statement extends the reporting of discontinued operations to all components of an entity and requires that results of operations of a component of an entity that has been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale  be reported in discontinued operations if its activities  operations and assets will be eliminated in the disposal transaction 
there is no material effect of sfas on the consolidated financial statements as the company is not presently contemplating any disposal of long lived assets 
effective january   the company adopted the recommendations outlined in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the company does not currently have any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities and accordingly there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this new standard 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total historical revenues from canadian operations amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited as the canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
our net earnings in canada for were approximately million  or approximately c million translated at the average exchange rate for of us c 
if the exchange rate used in had been c instead of c  the effect would be to reduce our net earnings by approximately million 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs 
we would consider implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases 
impact of inflation and changing prices our primary sources of revenues are parking revenues from owned and leased locations and management contract revenue net of expense reimbursements 
in the years ended december  and inflation had a limited impact on our operations 
quarterly results we may experience fluctuations in our income from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in revenues and related expenses due to acquisitions  pre opening costs  travel and transportation patterns affected by weather and calendar related events  and local and national economic conditions 
additionally  we manage the parking for a number of sports stadiums and arenas and our income can be affected by the relative degree of success of various sports teams 
information on our quarterly reported revenues  net income loss and earnings loss per share is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain factors affecting future operating results this annual report  including the information incorporated herein by reference contain certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of you can identify forward looking statements by the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume  will  should  and other expressions which predict or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate to historical matters 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the factors discussed below  our ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions  our ability to form and maintain strategic relationships with certain large real estate owners  and changes in assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the factors described on below and should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligations to update any forward looking statements 
our growth strategy may not succeed as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions of other parking operators 
in executing our acquisition strategy  we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
in addition  we expect to face competition from other parking providers for acquisition candidates  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
if we pursue any acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
if we complete an acquisition  we may have to devote a significant amount of management resources to integrating the acquired business with our existing business 
an acquisition might not produce the revenue or earnings that we anticipated  and an acquired operation may not perform as expected 
accordingly  our acquisition efforts may not succeed 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  an acquisition may result in non recurring charges or involve significant write offs of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results 
to pay for an acquisition  we might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use capital stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity would be reduced 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient access to capital to permit us to implement our acquisition strategies 
we also intend to pursue aggressive growth in targeted major cities in the united states 
however  we may not be able to sign up parking contracts in these cities due to competition from existing operators or reluctance from landlords to enter into agreements with an operator who is new in the local market 
furthermore  if we are able to add new facilities  we may incur losses on these new locations during the first or second year of operations as we attempt to achieve projected revenue targets by optimizing parking rates and marketing the facility 
severe winter weather may adversely affect our business the parking business depends on the free flow of vehicular traffic 
severe winter weather conditions in canada and the northern united states could close or significantly slow roadways 
this  in turn  may harm our business and adversely affect our cash flow by reducing the demand for parking and increasing our snow removal costs 
changes in privacy legislation could harm our business by making collections more difficult and costly city collections  an impark subsidiary  identifies vehicle owners in canada through searches based on license plate numbers 
the license plate data are maintained by each province in canada 
although most provinces have enacted privacy legislation regulating access to such data  city collections has entered into access agreements with several provinces 
should more restrictive privacy legislation be enacted it could adversely affect city collections business 
in addition  fees charged for searches of motor vehicle registration are also set by provincial governments and any increase in these fees will have an adverse effect on city collections business 
an increase in the cost of insurance claims could increase our costs we typically have a large number of small property or personal injury claims 
we have insurance to cover the cost of these claims  to the extent such costs exceed a deductible amount 
however  a major increase in the number and cost of claims to the insurance company could significantly increase the amount that we pay to insure against these claims 
currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  many of our operations are conducted in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial results  particularly our operating margins  and could also result in exchange losses 
to date we have not sought to hedge these risks  but may undertake hedging transactions in the future 
we cannot be certain  however  that any hedging techniques would be successful in preventing or limiting the adverse financial effects of exchange rate fluctuations 
we face risks associated with environmental regulations various federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations impose liabilities on a current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with our ownership  operation or acquisition of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
although we are currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us or any of our owned or operated parking facilities  we cannot give any assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us or against our owned or operated parking facilities 
we could face significant costs in defending against claims of liability or in remediating a contaminated property 
an increase in government regulation or taxation could harm our business the parking business is subject to a significant degree of government regulation 
the regulations include potentially costly matters such as requiring improvements to meet civic by laws  worker s compensation regulations and labor standards  as well as  environmental and other potentially costly legislation 
any new or increased levels of regulation could adversely impact our business 
the parking industry is also subject to increased taxation from the various levels of government 
historically  it has been considered as an environmentally unfriendly industry due to its primary purpose  which is to park automobiles driven into downtown business districts 
consequently the parking industry has been the subject of significant taxation including federal  state and provincial sales taxes  property taxes  business taxes and federal and provincial state income taxes 
our business will be adversely affected by any significant new tax legislation or increased levels of taxation  any of which could be retroactive 
various other governmental regulations affect our operation of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly  including air quality laws  licensing laws and the americans with disabilities act of under the ada  all public accommodations  including parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
although we believe that the parking facilities we own and operate are in substantial compliance with these requirements  a determination that we or the facility owner is not in compliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or damage awards against us 
in addition  several state  provincial and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit  including  for example  laws prohibiting employers from reimbursing employee parking expenses 
laws and regulations that reduce the number of cars and vehicles being driven could hurt our business 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources the parking industry is highly competitive 
our competitors range from small single lot operators to large regional and national multi facility operators  and include municipal and other governmental entities 
some of our present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we have 
furthermore  we compete for qualified management personnel with other parking facility operators  with property management companies and with property owners 
we may encounter increased competition in the future 
among other things  increased construction of parking facilities could limit our ability to attract customers  expand our business or maintain profitable pricing levels and could decrease our market share 
we compete for acquisitions with other parking facility operators  real estate developers and real estate investment trusts 
we may encounter increased competition for acquisitions in the future  and this competition could hurt our ability to complete acquisitions or have the effect of increasing the prices we must pay for acquisitions 
we believe that there will be rapid business consolidation in the parking services industry 
if this occurs and we are unable to participate successfully in the business consolidation  our business and financial results could be harmed 
a labor strike could hurt our competitiveness a significant number of our employees are members of labor unions 
as a result there is more risk of work stoppages due to strikes which could potentially be costly to us because increased labor costs could adversely affect our ability to retain management contracts and to remain competitive in the marketplace 
the large number of leased facilities increases the risk that we may not be able to cover the fixed costs of our leased facilities we leased and owned facilities as of december  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments  and in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  maintenance and operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by us and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
generally  performance of our parking facilities depend  in part  on our ability to negotiate favorable contract terms  our ability to control operating expenses  financial conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market generally 
the relative significance of our leases can be viewed in relation to the term remaining on currently active leases and the extent to which the direct costs of operating those leased facilities historically have been covered by revenue generated by the facilities  as follows year ended december  term expires direct costs coverage and thereafter total for leased locations that were open as at december  direct costs included minimum rental payments  contingent payments based upon a percentage of revenues  property taxes and other operating expenses 
coverage is calculated by dividing revenue by direct costs 
coverage should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute of measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
coverage is not an accepted measure under generally accepted accounting principles and other companies will use different measures or different calculations of profitability 
several of our locations are dependent on sports related traffic several of our leased facilities are located beside or in the vicinity of major sporting arenas 
a significant proportion of the revenue earned at these locations occurs during regular and post season games 
in  approximately of our revenue was earned from customers attending baseball games 
a player strike or other work stoppage leading to the cancellation of games  or a reduction in attendance at games  would substantially reduce the revenue earned at these locations 
however  our fixed rent commitments on these locations would be unchanged 
as a result  the profit we earn from these facilities would decrease significantly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk to december   we have not entered into significant derivative instruments either for hedging or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had no such instruments outstanding 
we will periodically hold excess available cash in cash equivalents which are short term deposits at major financial institutions with terms to maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less 
interest rates our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on cash invested in short term deposits which are all included in cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated real rate of return 
however  due to the short term nature of such investments  the risk of loss to market is not significant 
our bank indebtedness of million at december  bears interest at rates which vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total revenues from canadian operations amounted to million for the year ended december  as detailed in note to the financial statements 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
we believe that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited because our canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
our net earnings in canada for were approximately million  or approximately c million translated at the average exchange rate for of us c 
if the exchange rate used in had been c instead of c  the effect would be to reduce our net earnings by approximately million 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs  other than investing any excess canadian cash in us treasury bills 
we would consider implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases
