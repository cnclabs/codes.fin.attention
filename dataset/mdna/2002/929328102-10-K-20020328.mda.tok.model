credit extension activities traditionally  the majority of a typical thrift institution s loan portfolio has consisted of first mortgage loans on residential properties 
however  as a result of various legislative and regulatory changes since  the commercial and consumer lending powers of wsfs have increased substantially 
wsfs current lending activity is concentrated on lending to consumers and small businesses in the mid atlantic region of the united states 
the following table sets forth the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated 
other than as disclosed below  the company had no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans at december  december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential real estate      commercial real estate commercial mortgage      construction      total commercial real estate      commercial      consumer      gross loans      less unearned income      allowance for loan losses      net loans      includes     and  of residential mortgage loans held for sale at december      and  respectively 
the following table sets forth information as of december  regarding the amount of loans maturing in the company s portfolios  including scheduled repayments of principal based on contractual terms to maturity 
in addition  the table sets forth the amount of loans maturing during the indicated periods based on if the loan has a fixed or adjustable rate 
loans having no stated maturity or repayment schedule are reported in the one year or less category 
less than one to over one year five years five years total in thousands real estate loans     construction loans    commercial loans     consumer loans     rate sensitivity fixed     adjustable     gross loans     includes commercial mortgage loans  does not include loans held for sale 
the above schedule does not include any prepayment assumptions 
prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the interest rate environment 
management believes that the actual repricing and maturity of the loan portfolio is significantly shorter than is reflected in the above table as a result of prepayments 
residential real estate lending 
wsfs originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to 
wsfs generally requires private mortgage insurance for up to of the mortgage amount for mortgage loans with loan to value ratios exceeding 
wsfs does not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer 
on a very limited basis  wsfs originates purchases loans with loan to value ratios exceeding without a private mortgage insurance requirement 
at december   the balance of all such loans was approximately million 
generally  residential mortgage loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market 
however  unless loans are specifically designated for sale  the company holds newly originated loans in its portfolio for long term investment 
among other things  title insurance is required to insure the priority of its lien  and fire and extended coverage casualty insurance is required for the properties securing the residential loans 
all properties securing residential loans made by wsfs are appraised by independent appraisers selected by wsfs and subject to review in accordance with wsfs standards 
the majority of wsfs residential real estate adjustable rate loans have interest rates that adjust yearly  after an initial period 
usually the change in rate is limited to two percentage points at the adjustment date 
adjustments are generally based upon a margin currently over the weekly average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity  as published by the federal reserve board 
generally  the maximum rate on these loans is up to six percent above the initial interest rate 
wsfs underwrites adjustable rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market criteria 
wsfs does not originate adjustable rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization 
consistent with industry practice in its market area  wsfs has typically originated adjustable rate mortgage loans with discounted initial interest rates 
all such loans are underwritten at the fully indexed rate 
the retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans in wsfs loan portfolio helps mitigate wsfs risk to changes in interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of repricing adjustable rate mortgage loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower 
further  although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow wsfs to increase the sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on wsfs adjustable rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases in wsfs cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases 
the original contractual loan payment period for residential loans is normally to years 
because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty  such loans tend to remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time 
first mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses on adjustable and fixed rate loans 
this provision gives the institution the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rate on existing fixed rate mortgage loans to current market rates 
wsfs enforces due on sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws 
in addition to loans originated for its own portfolio  wsfs originates nonconforming residential mortgage loans through its non wholly owned subsidiary  wilmington national finance  inc wnf 
these loans are resold in the secondary market on a servicing released  limited recourse basis 
they are originated using the underwriting guidelines of the various investors to which wnf sells its loans 
these loans are typically sold to investors within to days of origination 
the mortgage loans that wnf originates are fully amortizing  fixed or adjustable rate  first or second lien mortgage loans 
they are secured by one to four family residential properties with loan to value ratios up to and contractual terms of to years 
with respect to each property securing a mortgage loan  the underwriting guidelines require among other things  title insurance  fire and extended coverage casualty insurance  and a full appraisal by an independent appraiser selected and reviewed by wnf 
the majority of adjustable rate mortgage loans originated by wnf are indexed to the six month london interbank offered rate libor and have rates that adjust every six months after a initial fixed rate period of to months 
adjustments are limited to two percent at any adjustment date and six percent over the life of the loan 
in general  loans are sold without recourse except for the repurchase arising from standard contract provisions covering violation of representations and warranties or  under certain investor contracts  a default by the borrower on the first payment 
the company also has limited recourse exposure under certain investor contracts in the event a borrower prepays a loan in total within a specified period after sale  typically one year 
the recourse is limited to a pro rata portion of the premium paid by the investor for that loan  less any prepayment penalty collectible from the borrower 
commercial real estate  construction and commercial lending 
federal savings banks are generally permitted to invest up to of their total regulatory capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to of its assets in commercial loans 
as a federal savings bank which was formerly chartered as a delaware savings bank  wsfs has certain additional lending authority 
wsfs offers commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi family properties and other commercial real estate 
generally  loan to value ratios for these loans do not exceed of appraised value at origination 
wsfs offers commercial construction loans to developers 
in some cases these loans are made as construction permanent loans  which provides for disbursement of loan funds during construction and automatic conversion to mini permanent loans years upon completion of construction 
these construction loans are made on a short term basis  usually not exceeding two years  with interest rates indexed to the wsfs prime rate  in most cases  and adjusted periodically as wsfs prime rate changes 
the loan appraisal process includes the same evaluation criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans  but also takes into consideration completed plans  specifications  comparables and cost estimates 
prior to approval of the credit  these items are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed 
policy requires that all appraisals be reviewed independently of the commercial lending area 
generally  the loan to value ratios for construction loans do not exceed 
the initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined by the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan 
at december   million was committed for construction loans  of which million had been disbursed 
wsfs commercial lending  excluding real estate loans  includes loans for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes 
these loans generally range in amounts up to million  and their terms range from less than one year to seven years 
the loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to wsfs prime rate  or libor  at the time of closing 
wsfs intends to continue originating commercial loans to small businesses in its market area 
commercial  commercial mortgages and construction lending has a higher level of risk as compared to residential mortgage lending 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and may be more subject to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the economy generally 
the majority of wsfs commercial and commercial real estate loans are concentrated in delaware and surrounding areas 
construction loans involve additional risk because loan funds are advanced as the construction progresses 
the valuation of the underlying collateral can be difficult to quantify prior to the completion of the construction 
this is due to uncertainties inherent in construction such as changing construction costs  delays arising from labor or material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies 
wsfs attempts to mitigate these risks and plan for these contingencies through additional analysis and monitoring of its construction projects 
federal law limits the extensions of credit to any one borrower to of unimpaired capital  or if the difference is secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value that can be determined by reliable and continually available pricing 
extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds  such as standby letters of credit  but do not include unfunded loan commitments 
wsfs had a million loan to refinance an employee stock ownership plan esop loan of a company 
approximately of the loan is secured by discounted us treasury securities 
the portion of the loan that is secured by us treasury securities is exempt from the above lending limits 
at december   no borrower had collective outstandings exceeding the above limits 
consumer lending 
the primary consumer credit products of the company are equity secured installment loans and home equity lines of credit 
at december   wsfs had equity secured installment loans totaling million  which represented of total consumer loans 
a home equity line of credit grants borrowers a line of credit of up to of the appraised value net of any senior mortgages of the residence 
this line of credit is secured by a mortgage on the borrower s property and can be drawn upon at any time during the period of agreement 
at december   wsfs had extended million in home equity lines of credit  of which million had been drawn at the date 
home equity lines of credit potentially offer federal income tax advantages  the convenience of checkbook access and revolving credit features 
over the past few years  however  home equity lines of credit have decreased because low interest rates offered on first and second mortgage loans have enabled consumers to refinance their mortgages and consolidate their debt 
although home equity lines of credit expose the company to the risk that falling collateral values may leave it inadequately secured  the company has not had any significant adverse experience to date 
the table below sets forth consumer loans by type  in amounts and percentages at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent equity secured installment loans      home equity lines of credit      automobile      unsecured lines of credit      other      total consumer loans      loan originations  purchase and sales 
wsfs has traditionally engaged in lending activities primarily in delaware and contiguous areas of neighboring states 
as a federal savings bank  however  wsfs may originate  purchase and sell loans throughout the united states 
wsfs has purchased limited amounts of loans from outside its normal lending area when such purchases are deemed appropriate and consistent with wsfs overall practices 
wsfs originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential real estate loans through its banking offices 
in addition  wsfs has established relationships with correspondent banks and mortgage brokers to originate loans 
during  the company originated million of residential real estate loans  of which million were from wnf 
this compares to originations of million in from time to time  wsfs has purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with its ongoing asset and liability management objectives 
purchases of residential real estate loans from correspondents and brokers primarily in the mid atlantic region totaled million for the year ended december   million for and million for wsfs also periodically purchases residential mortgages from wnf with the intention of holding in its portfolio 
these purchases totaled million in residential real estate loan sales totaled million in  million in and million in while wsfs generally intends to hold loans for the foreseeable future  wsfs sells newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to control the interest sensitivity of its balance sheet 
the corporation holds for investment certain of its fixed rate mortgage loans  with terms under years  consistent with current asset liability management strategies 
at december   wsfs serviced approximately million of residential loans for other lenders compared to million at december  the company also services residential loans for its portfolio totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
wsfs originates commercial real estate and commercial loans through its commercial lending division 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  business expansion  working capital and other business purposes during  wsfs originated million of commercial and commercial real estate loans compared with million in these amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not reflect amounts outstanding on such loans 
wsfs consumer lending is conducted primarily through its branch offices 
wsfs originates a variety of consumer credit products including home improvement loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  credit cards  unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans 
during  consumer loan originations amounted to million compared to million in all loans to one borrower exceeding million must be approved by a management loan committee 
minutes of the management loan committee meetings and individual loans exceeding million approved by the management loan committee are subsequently reviewed by the executive committee and board of directors of wsfs 
separate approval is needed for loans to any borrower who has direct or indirect outstanding commitments in excess of million or for any advances or extensions on loans previously classified by banking regulators or wsfs risk management department 
officers of wsfs have the authority to approve smaller loan amounts  depending upon their experience and management position 
fee income from lending activities 
wsfs earns interest and fee income from lending activities  including fees for originating loans  for servicing loans and for loan participations sold 
the bank also receives for making commitments to originate construction  residential and commercial real estate loans 
additionally  the bank collects fees related to existing loans which include prepayment charges  late charges and assumption fees 
wsfs charges fees for making loan commitments 
also as part of the loan application process  the borrower may pay wsfs for out of pocket costs to review the application  whether or not the loan is closed 
most loan fees are considered adjustments of yield in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and are reflected in interest income 
those fees represented an immaterial amount of interest income during the three years ended december  loan fees other than those considered adjustments of yield are reported as loan fee income  a component of other income 
all fee income on loans originated by wnf for sale to third party investors  including origination fees  points collected from borrowers and sales premiums paid by investors  are recognized when loans are sold 
provisions are made for recourse obligations 
loan loss experience  problem assets and delinquencies the company s results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the company endeavors to manage its portfolios to identify problem loans as promptly as possible and take actions immediately which will minimize losses 
to accomplish this  wsfs risk management department monitors the asset quality of the company s loan and investment in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the credit policy committee  the audit committee of the board of directors and the controller s department 
subsidiaries the corporation has two subsidiaries  wilmington savings fund society  fsb wsfs and wsfs capital trust i 
wsfs capital trust i was formed in to issue trust preferred securities 
the trust invested all of the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities in junior subordinated debentures of the corporation 
the corporation used the proceeds from the junior subordinated debentures for general corporate purposes  including the redemption of higher yielding debt 
at december   wsfs had three wholly owned  first tier subsidiaries investment group  inc  ssdc and wcc 
in addition to the wholly owned subsidiaries  the corporation consolidates two non wholly owned subsidiaries  customerone financial network  inc cfn and wnf 
wsfs is the primary lender to its non bank subsidiaries 
at december   it had million invested in the equity of these companies and had an additional million in loans outstanding 
investment group  inc was formed in this subsidiary markets various third party investment and insurance products  such as single premium annuities  whole life policies and securities primarily through wsfs branch system 
ssdc was formed in march with the objective of engaging in residential real estate projects through either wholly owned subsidiaries or investments in joint ventures 
ssdc is currently inactive 
wcc is engaged primarily in indirect motor vehicle leasing 
on december   the board approved plans to discontinue the operations of wcc 
wcc  which had  lease contracts and  loan contracts at december   no longer accepts new applications but continues to service existing loans and leases until their maturity 
management estimates that substantially all loan and lease contracts will mature by the end of december accounting for discontinued operations of a business segment requires that the company forecast operating results over the wind down period and accrue any expected net losses 
the historic results of wcc s operations  the accrual of expected losses to be incurred over the wind down period  and the future reported results of wcc are required to be treated as discontinued operations of a business segment  and shown in summary form separately from the company s results of continuing operations in reported results of the corporation 
prior periods are restated  as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as a result  net operating losses of million for the year ended december  and net income of million for the year ended december  were reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations 
in addition in  the corporation recognized a charge of million  net of million in tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  for the expected loss over the projected three year wind down period 
a million pretax reserve was established to absorb these expected future losses 
during  used vehicle values continued to deteriorate 
this decline was exacerbated and continues to be affected by  among other things  the continued incenting of new vehicles by auto manufacturers 
as a result  management s analysis of residual losses as of december  indicated that additional reserves were needed for the expected losses in the business during its wind down 
accordingly  management recorded an additional million  pre tax  for expected losses over the wind down period 
the balance of reserves for residual losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the remaining portfolio 
as of december   there were million of contractual residuals still on lease for which management has estimated million in probable losses 
the losses have been inherently provided for in residual reserves and reserves for discontinued operations 
due to the uncertainty of a number of factors  including residual values  interest rate volatility and credit quality  this reserve will be reevaluated quarterly with adjustments  if necessary  recorded as income loss on wind down of discontinued operations 
accounting for discontinued operations also requires that the net assets assets less third party liabilities be reclassified on the balance sheet to a single line item  net assets of discontinued operations 
cfn provides direct to customer marketing  servicing and internet development and technology management for branchless financial services 
since the fourth quarter of wsfs and cfn have been engaged in a joint effort through a division of wsfs  everbank  to provide branchless financial services on a national level 
wsfs originally invested million  which had a book value of million at december  including approximately million in goodwill 
wsfs currently has a interest in cfn  with warrants to acquire additional ownership under certain circumstances  but retains majority control through a voting trust 
therefore  the results of cfn are and will continue to be consolidated into wsfs until everbank  obtains a separate banking charter or is otherwise disposed 
cfn paid a management fee to wsfs of  in and  in which is partially eliminated in consolidation 
cfn had total assets of million at december  and million at december  net losses after minority interest were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cfn everbank issues deposits denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   those deposits totaled million 
short term forward exchange contracts are purchased to provide and effective hedge on the fair value of deposits from fluctuations that may occur in world currency markets 
at december   the fair value of hedges amounted to a  liability 
under the terms of its agreement with wsfs  cfn has the right to acquire the deposits and business of everbank if cfn obtains its own depository institution charter 
cfn has submitted an application to the office of thrift supervision ots for a separate thrift charter for everbank and is in discussions with potential strategic partners for the purpose of raising the capital required to support an independent thrift institution 
in  the services agreement between wsfs and cfn to run the everbank division will expire 
the impact on wsfs of the expiration of the arrangement will depend on the outcome of several possible strategies if cfn receives approval from the ots for a separate charter and raises the required capital  wsfs investment in cfn would likely be preserved or possibly enhanced  if cfn is unable to obtain a separate charter  wsfs and cfn would likely pursue a sale of the division and preservation or enhancement of wsfs interest would depend on sale price  if wsfs and cfn are unable sell the division  other possibilities would be considered including the write off of wsfs investment in cfn 
in this last case  other costs may result 
the ultimate strategy and degree of success can not be determined at this time  but will likely be known by the end of management is aggressively pursuing a separate charter 
cfn everbank is currently a relatively low margin business 
if cfn everbank is spun off or sold  the corporation would likely experience an improvement in performance ratios such as the efficiency ratio  net interest margin and the return on average assets and equity  as well as capital ratios 
wnf is a owned subsidiary and began operations in december in addition  wsfs holds warrants to purchase an additional ownership 
wnf is a nonconforming mortgage banker generally dealing in higher grade subprime loans 
wnf solicits and originates its loans primarily as a result of referrals through independent mortgage brokers  although direct to consumer originations accounted for and of total originations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
wnf originates all loans and sells its originations to investors  typically well known regional banks or national finance companies  on a whole loan  servicing released basis for cash premiums only no securitizations 
mortgage loans are sold with very limited recourse beyond the standard representations and warranties 
as of december   wnf s wholesale channel consisted of seven regional sales offices located throughout the continental united states 
these offices are located in plymouth meeting  pa  north kingston  ri  charlotte  nc  atlanta  ga  naperville  il  livermore  ca and las vegas  nv 
the offices in atlanta  charlotte and las vegas were opened during the second half of management expects an additional office or two may be opened in depending on the business climate and the ability to recruit quality  experienced office managers 
the regional offices obtain business by establishing relationships with  and soliciting mortgage applications from  independent mortgage brokers in their local markets 
these mortgage brokers match their applicants with lenders such as wnf based on the types of products  pricing and the level of service provided by the lenders 
brokers may be paid for their services by either the borrower or by the lender  depending on the requirements of the transaction 
wnf has a centralized secondary marketing function which analyzes the product offerings of the various end investors  consolidates the investors underwriting guidelines into the product parameters that wnf offers to its brokers and ultimately sells wnf s originations to the end investors 
between the time loans are originated and sold  they are warehoused on wnf s balance sheet 
wsfs provides temporary financing for the loans through a warehouse line of credit with an adjustable rate based on the one month federal home loan bank advance rate basis points 
this line is limited to million and had an outstanding balance of million at december  this line may be increased to million on a temporary basis 
for each of the years ended december  and  loans remained in the warehouse for an average of days before being sold 
the percentage of loans in the warehouse that were days old or greater were at december  and at december  the following table provides certain wnf production and sales statistics for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands origination dollars   origination units   average mortgage balance weighted average note rate weighted average cltv weighted average credit score percentage of second liens sales   sales margin average combined loan to value represents the mortgage amount plus any senior liens or junior liens if also originated by wnf divided by the appraised value of the property 
wnf s total assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   wnf added million to the net income of the corporation compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  at december   wsfs also held million in the preferred stock of wnf 
results for the year for wnf were positively influenced by both organic growth of new business and the very favorable mortgage refinance market 
management expects as interest rates increase  production may abate  however this may be offset to an unknown extent by continued build out of the business model 
sources of funds wsfs funds its operations through retail and wholesale deposit growth as well as through various borrowing sources  including repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of pittsburgh 
loan repayments and investment maturities also provide sources of funds 
loan repayments and investment maturities provide a relatively stable source of funds while certain deposit flows tend to be more susceptible to market conditions 
borrowings are used to fund wholesale asset growth  short term funding of lending activities when loan demand exceeds projections  or when deposit inflows or outflows are less than or greater than expected 
on a long term basis  borrowings may be used to match against specific loans or support business expansion

generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which the savings institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus and ii require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non affiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by sections a and b  no savings association may i lend or otherwise extend credit to an affiliate  except for any affiliate which engages only in activities which are permissible for bank holding companies  or ii purchase or invest in any stocks  bonds  debentures  notes or similar obligations of any affiliate  except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association 
savings associations are also prohibited from extending credit  offering services  or fixing or varying the consideration for any extension of credit or service on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services from a competitor of the institution  subject to certain limited exceptions 
restrictions on acquisitions 
unless the acquiror was a unitary savings and loan holding company on may  or became a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to an application pending as of that date  no company may acquire control of the company unless the company is only engaged in activities that are permitted for multiple savings and loan holding companies or for financial holding companies under the bank holding company act of bhca  as amended by the gramm leach bliley act 
financial holding companies may engage in activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  has determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity or complementary to a financial activity provided that the complementary activity does not pose a risk to safety and soundness 
financial holding companies that were not previously bank holding companies may continue to engage in limited non financial activities for up to ten years after the effective date of the gramm leach bliley act with provision for extension for up to five additional years by the federal reserve board provided that the financial holding company is predominantly engaged in financial activities 
savings and loan holding companies are prohibited from acquiring  without prior approval of the director of ots  i control of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company or substantially all the assets thereof  or ii more than of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof which is not a subsidiary 
under certain circumstances  a savings and loan holding company is permitted to acquire  with the approval of the director of ots  up to of the voting shares of an under capitalized savings association pursuant to a qualified stock issuance without that savings association being deemed controlled by the holding company 
except with the prior approval of the director of ots  no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than of such company s stock  may also acquire control of any savings association  other than a subsidiary savings association  or of any other savings and loan holding company 
the director of ots may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if i the company involved controls a savings institution which operated a home or branch office in the state of the association to be acquired as of march   ii the acquirer is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the federal deposit insurance act  or iii the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit institutions to be acquired by state chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings institutions 
the laws of delaware do not specifically authorize out of state savings associations or their holding companies to acquire delaware chartered savings associations 
the statutory restrictions on the formation of interstate multiple holding companies would not prevent wsfs from entering into other states by mergers or branching 
ots regulations permit federal associations to branch in any state or states of the united states and its territories 
except in supervisory cases or when interstate branching is otherwise permitted by state law or other statutory provision  a federal association may not establish an out of state branch unless the federal association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under section a of the internal revenue code or as a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act and the total assets attributable to all branches of the association in the state would qualify such branches taken as a whole for treatment as a domestic building and loan association or qualified thrift lender 
federal associations generally may not establish new branches unless the association meets or exceeds minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ots will also consider the association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act of in connection with any branch application 
regulation of wsfs general 
as a federally chartered savings institution  wsfs is subject to extensive regulation by the ots 
the lending activities and other investments of wsfs must comply with various federal regulatory requirements 
the ots periodically examines wsfs for compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fdic also has the authority to conduct special examinations of wsfs as the insurer of deposits 
wsfs must file reports with ots describing its activities and financial condition 
wsfs is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere herein 
regulatory capital requirements 
under ots capital regulations  savings institutions must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier or core capital equal to of adjusted total assets or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examiner rating system  and total capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
in addition  ots regulations impose certain restrictions on savings associations that have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total assets of less than or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examination rating system 
for purposes of these regulations  tier capital has the same definition as core capital 
the ots capital rule defines tier or core capital as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual institutions and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill and  subject to certain limitations  mortgage and non mortgage servicing rights  purchased credit card relationships and credit enhancing interest only strips 
tangible capital is given the same definition as core capital but does not include qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings institution s intangible assets except for limited amounts of mortgage servicing rights 
the ots capital rule requires that core and tangible capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in nonincludable subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks  other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies 
adjusted total assets for purposes of the core and tangible capital requirements are a savings institution s total assets as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  increased by certain goodwill amounts and by a prorated portion of the assets of unconsolidated includable subsidiaries in which the savings institution holds a minority interest 
adjusted total assets are reduced by the amount of assets that have been deducted from capital  the savings institution s minority investments in unconsolidated includable subsidiaries and  for purposes of the core capital requirement  qualifying supervisory goodwill 
at december   wsfs was in compliance with both the core and tangible capital requirements 
the risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
under the ots risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight 
mortgage backed securities that qualify under the secondary mortgage enhancement act  including those issued  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by the fnma or fhlmc  are assigned a risk weight 
one to four family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding or covered by private mortgage insurance for any amounts in excess of  fixed rate multi family first mortgages not more than days past due with maturities of not less than seven years  loan to value ratios not exceeding if rate is adjustable  and annual net operating income equal to not less than of debt service if loan is adjustable and certain qualifying loans for the construction of one to four family residences pre sold to home purchasers are assigned a risk weight of 
consumer loans  non qualifying residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans  repossessed assets and assets more than days past due  as well as all other assets not specifically categorized  are assigned a risk weight of 
the portion of equity investments not deducted from core or supplementary capital is assigned a risk weight 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital  provided the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital 
supplementary capital is defined to include certain preferred stock issues  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that do not qualify as core capital  certain approved subordinated debt  certain other capital instruments  general loan loss allowances up to of risk weighted assets and up to of unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values 
total capital is reduced by the amount of the institution s reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments  all equity investments and that portion of land and non residential construction loans in excess of loan to value ratio 
the ots risk based capital standards require savings institutions with more than a normal level of interest rate risk to maintain additional total capital 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
a savings association with more than normal interest rate risk is required to deduct an interest rate risk component equal to one half of the excess of its measured interest rate risk over the normal level from its total capital for purposes of determining its compliance with the ots risk based capital guidelines 
at december   wsfs was in compliance with the ots risk based capital requirements 
loans to directors  officers and stockholders 
under section h of the federal reserve act  loans to an executive officer or director or to a greater than stockholder of a savings association and certain affiliated interests of either  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests  the association s loans to one borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to all such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans  above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency  to directors  executive officers and greater than stockholders of a savings association  and their respective affiliates  unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the association with any interested director not participating in the voting 
the federal reserve board has prescribed the loan amount which includes all other outstanding loans to such person  as to which such prior board of director approval if required  as being the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
further  loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not discriminate in favor of insiders 
section h also prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written  pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the savings association 
savings associations are subject to the requirements and restrictions of section g of the federal reserve act which requires that loans to executive officers of depository institutions not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded to other borrowers  requires approval for such extensions of credit by the board of directors of the institution  and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type  amount and terms of credits to such officers 
section of the bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
dividend restrictions 
savings associations must submit notice to the ots prior to making a capital distribution which includes cash dividends  stock repurchases and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash merger if a they would not be well capitalized after the distribution  b the distribution would result in the retirement of any of the association s common or preferred stock or debt counted as its regulatory capital  or c the association is a subsidiary of a holding company 
a savings association must make application to the ots to pay a capital distribution if x the association would not be adequately capitalized following the distribution  y the association s total distributions for the calendar year exceeds the association s net income for the calendar year to date plus its net income less distributions for the preceding two years  or z the distribution would otherwise violate applicable law or regulation or an agreement with or condition imposed by the ots 
deposit insurance 
wsfs may be charged semi annual premiums by the fdic for federal insurance on its insurable deposit accounts up to applicable regulatory limits 
the fdic may establish an assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums which protects the insurance fund and considers the fund s operating expenses  case resolution expenditures  income and effect of the assessment rate on the earnings and capital of members 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic which is determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective action 
within each capital group  institutions will be assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
because the bank insurance fund bif achieved its statutory reserve ratio of of insured deposits  the fdic has eliminated deposit insurance premiums for most bif members 
in the event that the bif should fail to meet its statutory reserve ratio  the fdic would be required to set semi annual assessment rates for bif members that are sufficient to increase the reserve ratio to within one year or in accordance with such other schedule that the fdic adopts by regulation to restore the reserve ratio in not more than years 
the fdic continues to assess bif member institutions to fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to help fund takeovers of insolvent thrifts 
until december   bif members were assessed at approximately one fifth the rate at which savings association insurance fund saif members were assessed 
after december   bif and saif members are being assessed at the same rate 
prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution generally is i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
significantly undercapitalized institutions and their holding companies may become subject to more severe sanctions including limitations on asset growth  restrictions on capital distributions by the holding company and possible divestiture requirements 
institutions generally must be placed in receivership within specified periods of time after they become critically undercapitalized 
under the ots regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  the ots measures a savings institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
a savings institution that is not subject to an order or written directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level is deemed well capitalized if it also has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater 
an adequately capitalized savings institution is a savings institution that does not meet the definition of well capitalized and has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier capital risk based ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater if the savings institution has a composite camels rating 
an undercapitalized institution is a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or if the institution has a composite camels rating 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is defined as a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
a critically undercapitalized savings institution is defined as a savings institution that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than 
federal home loan bank system 
wsfs is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of district fhlbs subject to supervision and regulation by the federal housing finance board fhfb 
the fhlbs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh  wsfs is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb of pittsburgh in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  whichever is greater 
wsfs was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlb of pittsburgh stock at december   of million 
the fhlb of pittsburgh offers advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhfb and the board of directors of the fhlb of pittsburgh 
long term advances may only be made to larger institutions like wsfs for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
federal reserve system 
pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board  a savings institution must maintain average daily reserves equal to on the first million of transaction accounts  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement may be to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
as of december  wsfs met its reserve requirements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general wsfs financial corporation company or corporation is a thrift holding company headquartered in wilmington  delaware 
substantially all of the corporation s assets are held by its subsidiary  wilmington savings fund society  fsb wsfs 
founded in  wsfs is one of the oldest financial institutions in the country 
as a federal savings bank which was formerly chartered as a state mutual savings bank  wsfs enjoys broader investment powers than most other financial institutions 
these grandfathered powers have allowed wsfs to diversify its revenue sources to a greater extent than most savings banks 
wsfs has served the residents of the delaware valley for years 
wsfs is the largest thrift institution headquartered in delaware and among the three or four largest financial institutions in the state on the basis of total deposits traditionally garnered in market 
the corporation s primary market area is the mid atlantic region of the united states which is characterized by a diversified manufacturing and service economy 
the long term goal of the corporation is to maintain its high performing financial services company status by focusing on its core banking business while occasionally developing profitable niches in highly synergistic businesses that have a strategic fit 
wsfs provides residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer lending services  as well as cash management services 
lending activities are funded primarily with retail deposit services and borrowings 
at december  there were retail banking offices located in northern delaware and southeastern pennsylvania in which wsfs conducted banking operations 
in january  for strategic reasons  wsfs transferred in store branch offices that were outside of its core footprint to another financial institution 
deposits are insured to their legal maximum by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the corporation has two consolidated subsidiaries  wsfs and wsfs capital trust i 
the corporation has no unconsolidated subsidiaries or off balance sheet entities 
fully owned and consolidated subsidiaries of wsfs include wsfs credit corporation wcc  which is engaged primarily in indirect motor vehicle leasing  and investment group  inc  which markets various third party insurance products and securities through wsfs branch system 
an additional subsidiary  star states development company ssdc  is currently inactive 
on december   the board of directors of wsfs financial corporation approved plans to discontinue the operations of wcc 
wcc  which had  lease contracts and  loan contracts at december   no longer accepts new applications but will continue to service existing loans and leases until their maturity 
management estimates that substantially all loan and lease contracts will mature by the end of december accounting for discontinued operations of a business segment requires that the company forecast operating results over the wind down period and accrue any expected net losses 
the historic results of wcc s operations  the accrual of expected losses to be incurred over the wind down period  and the future reported results of wcc are required to be treated as discontinued operations of a business segment  and shown in summary form separately from the company s results of continuing operations in reported results of the corporation 
prior periods are restated  as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as a result  net operating losses of million for the year ended december  and net income of million for the year ended december  were reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations 
in addition in  the corporation recognized a charge of million  net of million in tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  for the expected loss over the projected three year wind down period 
a million pretax reserve was established to absorb these expected future losses 
during  used vehicle values continued to deteriorate 
this decline was exacerbated and continues to be affected by  among other things  the continued incenting of new vehicles by auto manufacturers 
as a result  management s analysis of residual losses as of december  indicated that additional reserves were needed for the expected losses in the business during its wind down 
accordingly  management recorded an additional million  pre tax  for expected losses over the wind down period 
the balance of reserves for residual losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the remaining portfolio 
as of december   there were million of contractual residuals still on lease for which management has estimated million in probable losses 
the losses have been inherently provided for in residual reserves and reserves for discontinued operations 
due to the uncertainty of a number of factors  including residual values  interest rate volatility and credit quality  this reserve will be reevaluated quarterly with adjustments  if necessary  recorded as income losses on wind down of discontinued operations 
accounting for discontinued operations also requires that the net assets assets less third party liabilities be reclassified on the balance sheet to a single line item  net assets of discontinued operations 
in addition to the wholly owned subsidiaries  the corporation consolidates two non wholly owned subsidiaries  customerone financial network  inc cfn and wilmington national finance  inc 
wnf 
cfn provides direct to customer marketing  servicing and internet development and technology management for branchless financial services 
since the fourth quarter of wsfs and cfn have been engaged in a joint effort through a division of wsfs  everbank  to provide branchless financial services on a national level 
wsfs originally invested million  which had a book value of million at december  including approximately million in goodwill 
wsfs currently has a interest in cfn  with warrants to acquire additional ownership under certain circumstances  but retains majority control through a voting trust 
therefore  the results of cfn are and will continue to be consolidated into wsfs until everbank  obtains a separate banking charter or is otherwise disposed 
cfn paid a management fee to wsfs of  in and  in which is partially eliminated in consolidation 
cfn had total assets of million at december  and million at december  net losses after minority interest were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cfn everbank issues deposits denominated in foreign currencies 
at december  those deposits totaled million 
short term forward exchange contracts are purchased to provide an effective hedge on the fair value of deposits from fluctuations that may occur in world currency markets 
at december   the fair value of the hedges amounted to a  liability 
under the terms of its agreement with wsfs  cfn has the right to acquire the deposits and business of everbank if cfn obtains its own depository institution charter 
cfn has submitted an application to the office of thrift supervision ots for a separate thrift charter for everbank and is in discussions with potential strategic partners for the purpose of raising the capital required to support an independent thrift institution 
in  the services agreement between wsfs and cfn to run the everbank division will expire 
the impact on wsfs of the expiration of the arrangement will depend on the outcome of several possible strategies if cfn receives approval from the ots for a separate charter and raises the required capital  wsfs investment in cfn would likely be preserved or possibly enhanced  if cfn is unable to obtain a separate charter  wsfs and cfn would likely pursue a sale of the division and preservation or enhancement of wsfs interest would depend on sale price  if wsfs and cfn are unable sell the division  other possibilities would be considered including the write off of wsfs investment in cfn 
in this last case  other costs may result 
the ultimate strategy and degree of success can not be determined at this time  but will likely be known by the end of management is aggressively pursuing a separate charter 
cfn everbank is currently a relatively low margin business 
if cfn everbank is spun off or sold  the corporation would likely experience an improvement in performance ratios such as the efficiency ratio  net interest margin and the return on average assets and equity  as well as capital ratios 
wnf is a owned subsidiary and began operations in december in addition  wsfs holds warrants to purchase an additional ownership 
wnf is a nonconforming mortgage banker generally dealing in higher grade subprime loans 
wnf solicits and originates its loans primarily as a result of referrals through independent mortgage brokers  although direct to consumer originations accounted for and of total originations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
wnf originates all loans and sells its originations to investors  typically well known regional banks or national finance companies  on a whole loan  servicing released basis for cash premiums only no securitizations 
mortgage loans are sold with very limited recourse beyond the standard representations and warranties 
as of december   wnf s wholesale channel consisted of seven regional sales offices located throughout the continental united states 
these offices are located in plymouth meeting  pa  north kingston  ri  charlotte  nc  atlanta  ga  naperville  il  livermore  ca and las vegas  nv 
the offices in atlanta  charlotte and las vegas were opened during the second half of management expects an additional office or two may be opened in depending on the business climate and the ability to recruit quality  experienced office managers 
the regional offices obtain business by establishing relationships with  and soliciting mortgage applications from  independent mortgage brokers in their local markets 
these mortgage brokers match their applicants with lenders such as wnf based on the types of products  pricing and the level of service provided by the lenders 
brokers may be paid for their services by either the borrower or by the lender  depending on the requirements of the transaction 
wnf has a centralized secondary marketing function which analyzes the product offerings of the various end investors  consolidates the investors underwriting guidelines into the product parameters that wnf offers to its brokers and ultimately sells wnf s originations to the end investors 
between the time loans are originated and sold  they are warehoused on wnf s balance sheet 
wsfs provides temporary financing for the loans through a warehouse line of credit with an adjustable rate based on the one month federal home loan bank advance rate basis points 
this line is limited to million and had an outstanding balance of million at december  this line may be increased to million on a temporary basis 
for each of the years ended december  and  loans remained in the warehouse for an average of days before being sold 
the percentage of loans in the warehouse that were days old or greater were at december  and at december  the following table provides certain wnf production and sales statistics for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands origination dollars   origination units   average mortgage balance weighted average note rate weighted average cltv weighted average credit score percentage of second liens sales   sales margin average combined loan to value represents the mortgage amount plus any senior liens or junior liens if also originated by wnf divided by the appraised value of the property 
wnf s total assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   wnf added million to the net income of the corporation compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  at december   wsfs also held million in the preferred stock of wnf 
results for the year for wnf were positively influenced by both organic growth of new business and the very favorable mortgage refinance market 
management expects as interest rates increase  production may abate  however this may be offset to an unknown extent by continued build out of the business model 
the following discussion focuses on the major components of the entire company s operations and presents an overview of the significant changes in the results of operations for the past three fiscal years and financial condition during the past two fiscal years 
this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million in and  respectively 
income from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income 
net interest income is the most significant component of operating income to the corporation 
net interest income relies upon the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the difference or spread between the respective yields earned and rates paid 
the interest rate spread is influenced by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that affect interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the level of nonperforming loans can also impact the interest rate spread by reducing the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
net interest income decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in total interest income decreased million between and  primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on the reverse mortgage portfolio from to between and this decline in yield translates to a million decrease in net interest income offset in part by a  increase in net interest income reflecting the higher average balance of reverse mortgages in the long term expected yield on reverse mortgages at the end of is expected to be  however as a result of sec prescribed market value accounting  yields may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for further discussion of reverse mortgages  see the investment in reverse mortgages discussion included in this management discussion and analysis 
in addition to this decrease  rates were generally lower in as the target federal funds and similar short term rates decreased as much as basis points during the year 
total interest expense decreased million from to primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on deposits of basis points from to  and a decrease in the level of other borrowed funds of l million 
these items were partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits of million 
the decline in interest expense was also heavily affected by the aforementioned decline in interest rates in between and  interest income increased million  while interest expense increased million 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average loan balances of million between and  offset in part by a million decrease in mortgage backed securities 
in addition to this positive volume variance  overall rates were higher in than in  and specifically  the average yield on reverse mortgages increased to in from in the increase in interest expense was the result of the growth in interest bearing deposits by an average of million  partially offset by a million decrease in average borrowings 
the average rates on deposits increased basis points from to  while rates on federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowings increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated

provision for loan losses 
the corporation records a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which management considers its best estimate of known and probable inherent losses 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio and requires significant management judgment see the allowance for loan losses section of the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
for the year ended december   the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
this increase reflects  among other things  the company s loan growth  a change in the mix to higher margin and higher risk loans  a weakening economic environment in  offset by an overall improvement in credit quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the provision for the years ended december  and were  and million  respectively 
other income 
other income of million in  increased million  or from wnf contributed million to the positive variance  mainly in the form of gains on the sales of loans 
wnf s gains on sales of mortgages were positively influenced by both organic growth of new business and the very favorable mortgage refinance market 
credit debit card and atm income grew million during  due to the continued expansion of wsfs atm network and customer card usage 
at december  wsfs cashconnect division atm unit derived income from  atms compared to  at december  in addition  deposit service charges increased to million in primarily as a result of the growth in retail deposits 
in  other income was negatively affected by a million loss on the sale of securities recorded during these losses were the result of the corporations de leveraging strategy in which the corporation sold below market yielding investments to extinguish higher costing borrowings 
other income of million in  increased million  or from wnf contributed million to the positive variance  mainly in the form of gains on the sale of loans 
credit debit and atm income grew million during  due to the expansion of wsfs atm network and customer card usage 
at december  wsfs derived income from  atms compared to  at december  in addition  deposit service charges increased million to million in  a result of the growth in retail deposits 
partially offsetting these increases was a million increase in securities losses in the corporation recorded a million loss on the sale of below market yielding securities and loans in these losses were the result of the corporation s de leveraging strategy in which the corporation sold below market yielding investments to extinguish higher costing borrowings 
other expenses 
other expenses of million in  increased million or from cfn and wnf accounted for million of this increase mainly in salaries  benefits and other compensation 
excluding these two subsidiaries expenses increased million  or from these increases were mainly attributable to salaries and other expenses which increased million and million  respectively  partially offset by lower data processing and operations expense  which decreased by  during the third quarter of the corporation re assumed all responsibility for loan and deposit operations that were previously outsourced through the corporation s information technology provider 
expenses previously recorded as data processing and operations are currently reflected in salaries and benefit expenses 
in addition  the cashconnect division atm unit continued to expand during other expenses for included a charge of million connected with the exit of six in store branch offices in southeastern pennsylvania 
all other things equal  management expects net savings of over million annually related to the exit of these branches 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of management began a program to improve customer responsiveness  operational efficiency  and financial performance 
this plan internally called wsfs technology  organizational and process simplification plan  or tops is designed to clarify corporate strategy  simplify and better integrate technology solutions and redesign certain back office processes 
expenses related to the tops initiative totaled  for these costs consisted primarily of consulting fees and personnel costs 
management expects the plan will take approximately eighteen months to complete and involve approximately million in one time implementation expenses 
related to this program  management expects to achieve a recurring reduction in annual operating expenses of between million and million  once fully phased in by successful execution of the tops program necessarily involves operation and execution risk such as costs benefits varying from expectations or normal business routines being disrupted 
other expenses of million in  increased million or from cfn and wnf accounted for million of this increase  mainly in salaries  benefits and other compensation 
excluding these two startup initiatives expenses increased million in  or from increases in salaries  equipment expense  occupancy expense and other expenses were partially offset by lower data processing and operations expense 
the increases were primarily attributable to investments in four new retail banking offices during the year  and the expansion of the cashconnect division 
in addition  during the third quarter of the corporation re assumed all responsibility for loan and deposit operations that were previously outsourced through the corporation s information technology provider 
expenses previously recorded as data processing and operations are currently reflected in salaries and benefit expenses 
income taxes 
the corporation recorded an million tax provision for the year ended december  compared to a tax provision of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state  and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
approximately million in gross deferred tax assets of the corporation at december  are related to built in losses and net operating losses on reverse mortgages attributable to a former subsidiary 
management has continued to assess substantial valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets due to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code  and uncertainties including the timing of when these assets are realized 
the internal revenue service irs is examining the company s us income tax returns for the periods ended december  through management does not expect the outcome of this examination to have a material impact on the financial statements of the corporation 
the corporation analyzes its projection of taxable income on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its provision for income taxes accordingly

financial condition total assets increased million  or  during to billion 
this increase occurred predominantly in loans and investment securities 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in net assets of discontinued operations  the effect of maturities and repayments of loans and leases at the corporation s wholly owned indirect leasing subsidiary  wcc 
total liabilities increased million during the year to billion at december  the increase occurred primarily in retail deposits  which increased million 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decline in brokered deposits due to maturities 
during the corporation effectively replaced this funding source with borrowings from the fhlb  which increased million 
investments 
between december  and december   total investments increased million 
during that time  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased million while interest bearing deposits at other banks increased million 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities 
mortgage backed securities 
investments in mortgage backed securities increased million during to million 
this increase resulted primarily from purchases amounting to million 
this increase was partially offset by principal repayments of million and sales of million 
loans  net 
net loans  including loans held for sale  increased million during this included increases of million in commercial loans  million in commercial real estate loans and million in consumer loans 
residential loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased by million 
the change reflects management s continued strategy to shift the mix of loans to higher margin relationships 
loans held for sale increased million  the result of higher volume at the mortgage banking subsidiary wnf 
retail deposits 
retail deposits grew million  or  during to billion at december  retail deposit growth was driven primarily by money market  interest demand and noninterest demand accounts which  in total  increased million and included growth of million from the everbank division 
the table below depicts the changes in retail deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows outflows  net ending balance  borrowings and brokered certificates of deposits 
total borrowings increased million between december  and december  advances from the fhlb increased million and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million 
brokered deposits declined million between december  and december   and were replaced by retail deposit growth and additional fhlb advances 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase included million in net income and a million increase in other comprehensive income 
this was offset in part by the acquisition of million shares of treasury stock for million and dividends of million paid to stockholders 
asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the corporation is to manage and control its interest rate risk  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base  and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the corporation to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of the corporation s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table less than one to over one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans     mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment in reverse mortgages     investment securities     other investments   interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    retail time deposits     jumbo certificates of deposit    brokered certificates of deposit   fhlb advances     trust preferred borrowings and interest rate cap 
  other borrowed funds   excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap     interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets interest sensitive assets of discontinued operations are excluded as well as the interest sensitive funding of discontinued operations through fhlb advances which totaled million at december  includes commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities  which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the corporation  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of wsfs deposit accounts  that of money market and of interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
in november  the corporation purchased a ten year interest rate cap in order to limit its exposure on million of variable rate trust preferred securities issued in november this derivative instrument caps the month libor rate the base rate of the trust preferred borrowings at 
the trust preferred borrowings are classified in the less than one year category reflecting the ability to adjust upward for the balance of the term of the interest rate cap 
if the three month libor rate equals or exceeds  the trust preferred borrowing takes on a fixed characteristic and therefore is classified in the window corresponding to the caps maturity 
investment in reverse mortgages reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout the borrower s life or until the borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
since reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  the loan repayments are generally limited to the sale proceeds of the borrower s residence  and the mortgage balance consists of cash advanced  interest compounded over the life of the loan and a premium which represents a portion of the shared appreciation in the home s value  if any  or a percentage of the value of the residence 
the corporation accounts for its investment in reverse mortgages in accordance with the instructions provided by the staff of the securities and exchange commission entitled accounting for pools of uninsured residential reverse mortgage contracts which requires grouping the individual reverse mortgages into pools and recognizing income based on the estimated effective yield of the pool 
in computing the effective yield  the corporation must project the cash inflows and outflows of the pool including actuarial projections of the life expectancy of the individual contract holder and changes in the collateral values of the residence 
at each reporting date  a new economic forecast is made of the cash inflows and outflows of each pool of reverse mortgages  the effective yield of each pool is recomputed  and income is adjusted retroactively and prospectively to reflect the revised rate of return 
accordingly  because of this market value based accounting the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets include significant risk associated with estimations  and income can vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
in  the corporation acquired a pool of reverse mortgages the pool from the fdic and another lender 
the corporation s investment in this pool of reverse mortgages totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
of the loans that comprise the pool at december   loans  or  are located in delaware  new jersey  pennsylvania and maryland 
management has made the assumption that future estimated collateral values are expected to decrease in and remain constant thereafter 
in november  the corporation purchased providential home income plan  inc  a california based reverse mortgage lender  for approximately million 
providential s assets at acquisition primarily consisted of cash and its investment in reverse mortgages the pool 
the carrying value of the reverse mortgages was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
all of the loans that comprise the pool at december   are located in california 
future estimated collateral values are expected to decrease in and increase thereafter 
at december   the corporation s net investment in reverse mortgages totaled million 
the yield for the year ended december  was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the yields can vary significantly from period to period depending on actual and estimated cash flows 
management currently expects the long term yield to be approximately 
since funding and operating costs associated with reverse mortgages are relatively small and stable  any change in reverse mortgage revenue can have a significant affect on the corporation s pre tax income 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
one measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the table below is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on the company s net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a december  change in interest change in change in rate net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio basis points margin value margin value the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate environment changes 
the net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate environment changes 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points may not be particularly meaningful at december  given the historically low absolute level of interest rates at that time 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on the company s asset liability structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure can negatively affect the corporation s results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the corporation s non performing assets  restructured loans and past due loans at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial      consumer commercial mortgages      residential mortgages      construction total nonaccruing loans      nonperforming investments in real estate assets acquired through foreclosure   total nonperforming assets      restructured loans  past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages   consumer total past due loans      ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans ratio of loan loss and foreclosed asset allowance to total nonperforming assets total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets decreased by million between and after increasing by  between and the year over year decrease reflects the sale of a million commercial real estate property in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase of  in residential real estate nonperforming loans in an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three fiscal years is presented below year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual restructured status    charge offs write downs    ending balance    the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans decreased from in to in the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased from in to in these decreases were primarily due to the decrease in nonaccruing loans 
in  million in collections of such assets  as well as million in transfers to accrual status contributed to the reduction in nonperforming assets 
such decreases were offset by the addition of million of loans that were not previously classified as nonperforming 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation maintains allowances for credit losses and charges losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant management judgement reflecting management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
management establishes the loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogenous loans 
specific reserves are established for certain loans  in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans in each case based on the internal risk grade of loans 
changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
loss factors by risk grade have a basis in wsfs historical loss experience for such loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
see discussion on historical loss adjustment factors below 
pooled loans are loans that are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogenous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
pooled loan loss allowances are based on historical net charge offs for six years which management believes approximates an average business cycle 
the average loss allowance per homogenous pool is based on the product of average annual historical loss rate and the average estimated duration of the pool multiplied by the pool balances 
these separate risk pools are then assigned a reserve for losses based upon this historical loss information  as adjusted for historical loss adjustment factors 
historical loss adjustment factors are based upon management s evaluation of various current conditions 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these more current conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific credits 
the more current conditions  evaluated in connection with the adjustment factors  include an evaluation of the following o general economic and business conditions affecting wsfs key lending areas  o credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  o recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  o collateral values and loan to value ratios  o loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix  o seasoning of the loan portfolio  o specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  o bank regulatory examination results  and o other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes 
wsfs loan officers and risk managers meet monthly to discuss and review these conditions  and also risks associated with individual problem loans 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a monthly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the availability of more recent information 
the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance      provision for loan losses   reclass from allowance for ore losses balance at acquisition of credit card portfolio charge offs residential real estate commercial real estate commercial  consumer   total charge offs      recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total recoveries net charge offs      ending balance      net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income includes commercial mortgage and construction loans 
for the year ended december   the corporation provided million for loan losses 
this increase reflects  among other things  the company s loan growth  a change in the mix to higher margin and higher risk loans  a weakening economic environment in  offset by an overall improvement in credit quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have seasoned  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure  however  such allocations are not indicative of where future losses will occur

liquidity in accordance with thrift bulletin  the ots requires institutions  such as wsfs to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operation 
wsfs liquidity ratio of cash and qualified assets to net withdrawable deposits and borrowings due within one year was at december   compared to at december  management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
the corporation s primary funding sources are operating earnings  deposits  repayments of loans and investment securities  sales of loans and borrowings 
in addition  the corporation s liquidity requirements can be accomplished through the use of its borrowing capacity from the fhlb of pittsburgh and other sources  the sale of certain securities and the pledging of certain loans for other lines of credit 
management believes these sources are sufficient to maintain the required and prudent levels of liquidity 
at december  and  wsfs had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million  respectively 
at december   wsfs had the capacity to borrow up to million 
the corporation routinely enters into commitments requiring the future outlay of funds 
currently  wsfs is winding down the final year of its agreement with alltel  the company that has been managing data processing operations since  and will incur a minimum payment of approximately million in wsfs is currently negotiating a new data processing contract with metavante corporation the corporation also has four years remaining on a five year commitment with telecommunication companies 
under the terms of this agreement  the average minimum payment for each of the remaining four years is million 
the aforementioned commitments  as well as loan commitments  are expected to be met through traditional funding sources  such as operating earnings  deposits  short term borrowings  advances from the fhlb and principal repayments on loans and investments 
during  financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of million  while operating and investing activities used million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional fhlb advances and an increase in demand and savings accounts 
this cash was used primarily to fund loans and purchase mortgage backed securities 
during  operating and investing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of  and million  respectively  while financing activities used million 
the cash provided by operating and investing activities resulted primarily from the sales of loans held for sale and mortgage backed securities 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of mortgage backed securities and to fund an increase in loans  as well as to repay borrowings and purchase treasury stock 
in  financing activities provided million of cash and cash equivalents  while operating and investing activities used million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional fhlb advances and increases in demand and time deposits 
this cash was utilized to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as the repayment of other borrowings  and to fund the net increase in loan volume 
the corporation has not used  and has no intention to use  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity purposes 
the corporation s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and an interest rate cap which limits the exposure to rising rates on million of trust preferred floating rate debt 
in addition  wsfs has not had  and has no intention to have  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect its liquidity or capital resources 
wsfs has not  and does not intend to  trade in commodity contracts 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as wsfs to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   wsfs is classified as well capitalized and is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
for additional information concerning wsfs regulatory capital compliance see note to the financial statements 
as part of its capital management strategy  the corporation from time to time purchases its own shares of common stock to be included as treasury shares 
since  the board of directors has approved six separate stock repurchase programs to reacquire common stock outstanding 
as part of these programs  the corporation acquired approximately million shares in both and at december   the corporation held million shares of its common stock as treasury shares 
the corporation may continue repurchasing shares in depending on capital levels and potential uses of capital 
impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation
