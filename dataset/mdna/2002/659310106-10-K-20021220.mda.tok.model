item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the operating companies  subsidiaries of exxonmobil corp 
and the royal dutch group  pay monthly royalties to the trust based on their sales of natural gas  sulfur and oil 
the oldenburg concession is the primary area from which these products are extracted and provides nearly of all the royalties received by the trust 
of these three products  natural gas provides approximately of the total royalties 
the gas is sold to various distributors under long term contracts which delineate  among other provisions  the timing  manner  volume and price of the gas sold 
the pricing mechanisms contained in these contracts include a delay factor of three to six months and use the price of light heating oil in germany as one of the primary pricing components 
since germany must import a large percentage of its energy requirements  the us dollar price of oil on the international market has a significant  although delayed  impact on the price of gas 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see item legal proceedings and note to financial statements contained herein 
the trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which with sales volumes form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received by the trust upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income decreased from  to  the decline in world oil prices that began in the latter half of fiscal continued into this fiscal year resulting in a fairly steady decline in gas prices from the high point experienced in the third quarter of fiscal the general economic slowdown in europe contributed to the reduction in royalties paid to the trust by reducing the demand for natural gas thus resulting in lower sales 
after lingering in the range of for the first half of fiscal  the euro staged a rally climbing to an average of over for the second half of fiscal under the higher royalty rate agreement with exxon mobil the average gas price for each quarter of fiscal showed a decline when compared to the prior fiscal year s equivalent quarter 
for the fiscal year gas sold under this agreement averaged euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh compared to the average sales price of ecents kwh for fiscal  a decline of 
under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb the average gas price for each quarter of fiscal showed a decline when compared to the prior fiscal year s equivalent quarter 
for the fiscal year gas sold under this agreement averaged ecents kwh compared to the average sales price of ecents kwh for fiscal  a decline of 
when we use the average exchange rates and convert prices measured in ecents kwh into more familiar terms of dollars mcf  we see average gas prices under the higher and lower royalty rate agreements of mcf and mcf  declines of and  respectively 
while the annual maintenance at the grossenkneten desulfurization plant was conducted during a different quarter than the prior fiscal year  the scope and duration of the work was similar 
this fact is significant in that the ratio in the sales of sour gas and sweet gas was similar to the prior fiscal year 
since the majority of gas sold from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg is sour gas and must be processed through grossenkneten  any change in the plant s production capacity can have significant consequences to the amount of royalties the trust receives 
in fiscal western gas sales accounted for of overall oldenburg gas sales 
in fiscal western gas sales accounted for of overall oldenburg gas sales 
for fiscal the decline in gas production and sales was fairly evenly divided between the western and eastern halves of the oldenburg concession 
western gas sales declined from billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal eastern gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal interest income for was lower for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as a whole due to reduced funds available for investment and lower interest rates in effect 
trust expenses declined by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal trust expenses were reduced due to the reimbursement by the new york stock exchange for expenses associated with the trust s symbol change from net to nrt on january  however  the amount of the reduction was substantially offset by additional legal and audit expenses associated with the change in the trust s auditors and additional requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley of act during both fiscal and no trust units were issued and no dividends or distributions were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
management believes that the number of such presentations will continue to be immaterial in the coming years 
during fiscal an agreement was reached with the administrator of unclaimed property  office of the new york state comptroller 
under the terms of that agreement the trust issued  units to the state of new york and is paying current distributions on those units 
after the year  pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears will be eliminated 
see note to the financial statements contained herein for further information 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income increased from  to  the lingering impact of higher world oil prices on german gas prices as well as reduced maintenance downtime at the grossenkneten desulfurization plant  which resulted in higher gas sales from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg  combined to produce the increase in royalties 
the euro continued to exhibit its weakness relative to the dollar 
for each of the first three quarters the dollar value of the euro was below that of the prior fiscal year and only in the final quarter did the value of the euro increase over the prior fiscal year s quarter 
the high world oil prices that continued into the first half of fiscal continued to be reflected through the contractual delay mechanism in the high gas prices for gas sold from the oldenburg concession throughout the fiscal year 
for the first three quarters average oldenburg gas prices under the lower royalty rate agreement posted quarter over quarter increases reaching a high point of euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh in the third quarter 
the decline in oil prices was finally reflected in gas prices during the fourth quarter with average gas prices falling to ecents kwh 
for the fiscal year average gas prices posted a increase to a value of ecents kwh 
average gas prices under the higher royalty rate agreement followed a similar track rising to a high point of ecents kwh in the third quarter before falling back to ecents kwh in the fourth quarter 
in average for the fiscal year gas prices increased to ecents kwh 
when we use the average exchange rates and convert prices measured in ecents kwh into more familiar terms of dollars mcf  we see average gas prices under the lower and higher royalty rate agreements of mcf and mcf  increases of and  respectively 
for fiscal overall oldenburg gas sales showed a slight decline for the fiscal year falling from billion cubic feet bcf to bcf 
this decline  which was concentrated in the lower royalty rate area of eastern oldenburg  was more than offset by an increase in gas sales from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg 
western oldenburg gas sales increased from bcf to bcf in total for the fiscal year 
in contrast to the prior fiscal year when the grossenkneten plant underwent a sizeable multi year renovation and repair program which entailed an extended reduction in processing capacity  the impact of this year s scheduled maintenance was comparatively minor 
since the gas in western oldenburg is predominantly sour gas which must be processed to remove the hydrogen sulfide component the reduced downtime at grossenkneten permitted operations to resume more quickly resulting in increased gas sales 
with an effective royalty rate in western oldenburg seven times greater than the royalty rate in eastern oldenburg  changes in the percentage of sales originating from western oldenburg can have significant effects on the level of trust royalties 
the percentage of western sales to total sales increased in fiscal from to reflecting the reduced downtime at the desulfurization plant 
since reaching its current all time low  based on the transfer rate for the trust s royalties  of a dollar equivalent value of during the trust s third fiscal quarter  the euro has maintained some stability 
in average for the fiscal year the euro declined from a dollar equivalent of for fiscal to for fiscal trust expenses increased by from  to  reflecting higher trustees fees pursuant to the formula contained in the trust agreement and higher trust expenses 
interest income increased from  to  reflecting greater sums available for investment 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional and trust units were issued and and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
management believes that the number of such presentations will continue to be immaterial in the coming years 
after the year  pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears will be eliminated
