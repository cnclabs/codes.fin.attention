the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item  business special considerations 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic bingo systems 
we currently market a fixed base system with light pen or touch screen activated monitors and portable hand held systems that can be played anywhere within a bingo hall 
as of october   we had systems in service in states of the more than states that allow electronic bingo systems for use with charitable and commercial organizations 
under the indian gaming regulatory act  or igra  electronic bingo may be played on tribal native american lands in the states where bingo is legal 
we estimate that bingo currently is played on tribal native american lands in states 
as of october   we had units in operation in native american bingo halls in of those states 
collectively  as of october   we had products in states and in four countries outside of the united states 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a a fixed fee per use per session  b a fixed weekly fee per unit  or c a percentage of the sales generated by each unit 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  and our ability to expand operations into new markets 
fixed base bingo units generate greater revenue per unit than portable bingo units  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we attribute our success to our ability to provide our customers with a combination of high quality electronic bingo units and superior customer service and support 
during fiscal  we performed various transition activities  including the following reorganized sales and service support regionally  experienced significant personnel changes at operational  service  sales  and corporate levels  both in terms of new hires  separations and reorganizations  improved financial reporting and controls  installed a new inventory management system  improved customer  distributor  and other contractual relationships  centralized and increased research and development personnel  completed enhancements and accelerated the plan for placement of the ted c color portable unit  reserved excess fixed based and hand held units  expanded internationally  and completed our relocation to reno  nevada that began during fiscal we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
during fiscal   and  our capital expenditures were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  almost all of which in and and million of which in  represented investments in bingo and related support equipment 
fiscal capital expenditures reflect a full implementation of a refurbishment program  compared with a new unit purchasing program in the prior years 
this change reflects reduced capitalized costs  increased refurbishment expenses  and increased cash savings during fiscal during fiscal  we increased research and development personnel and centralized our research and development functions 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of the expense of providing customer service  including labor  service related overhead  depreciation of the bingo systems  and excess unit reserves 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over a five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation

we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the approximately million  or  net decline in revenue from fiscal was primarily attributable to competitive pricing pressures  as well as the removal of approximately  bingo units in the southern region due to cancellation of a distributor contract during the second quarter of fiscal revenue increases were experienced in the northeastern and western regions and internationally 
installed units increased  units  from approximately  units at october  to approximately  units at october  however  revenue per unit generated by these additional units  in some cases  were lower due to fewer bingo sessions played per week or pricing pressures 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal cost of revenue as a percent of revenue for the current fiscal year was compared to for fiscal the increase during fiscal for cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased bingo unit maintenance  repair and refurbishment expenses of million compared to the prior year  principally as a result of an increased focus on the repair and upgrade of existing units as opposed to the acquisition of new units  an increase in the provision for excess uninstalled bingo units of million based on forecasts of unit placements impacted by expected new product ted c placements in fiscal and beyond  and bingo unit depreciation expenses increased  as a result of an increase in the number of bingo units installed and our revised estimate of useful life for uninstalled units that began in the first quarter of fiscal service and operational costs aggregating approximately million and million  during fiscal years and  respectively  remained constant 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million increase 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our executive management and our finance  legal and compliance  information technology  and human resources departments 
the increase in expenses over the prior year consists principally of an increase in personnel and related costs of million to million  including increases of  for severance costs associated with the retirement of a co founder and other executive management departures 
the provision for uncollectable accounts receivable increased million to million  including  relating to additional provision for distributors 
net increases in all other areas of  were offset by a reduction of  relating to relocation costs of the corporate offices to reno incurred during fiscal sales and marketing 
sales  marketing  and distributor commission expenses increased approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal payroll and related benefits increased  due to additional personnel and increases in compensation and benefits 
distributor commissions increased  to million  or as a percentage of revenue during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in distributor commissions as a percentage of revenue is a result of higher commission rates in states with increased revenue in comparison to the prior year  versus the commission rates in states in which revenue declined from the prior year  and the settlement of a distributor issue in the first quarter of fiscal for approximately research and development 
research and development costs increased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to retirement of a research and development co founder and associated costs of  and centralization of research and development personnel to reno  nevada  and other employee costs of  offset in part by reduced project costs of interest income expense 
net interest income totaled  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline was primarily the result of our reduction of  in short term investments and substantially lower interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the change in effective tax rates reflects the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses on the pre tax loss in fiscal versus pre tax income in the prior year 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal versus million for fiscal the growth is attributable to a net increase of approximately  units during fiscal  plus recognizing a full year of btc revenue compared to recognizing approximately nine months of btc revenue during fiscal additional business in the existing markets in ohio  florida  and south carolina  as well as new markets  significantly contributed to the rise in unit placements from  to  at october  and  respectively 
these gains were partially offset by competitive pricing pressures and a reduction of the number of bingo halls in texas that utilized our products in fiscal cost of revenue 
during fiscal  cost of revenue totaled million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in fiscal service costs and depreciation collectively rose million in fiscal while  as a percent of revenue  they grew to from in fiscal this percent of revenue increase is due in part to depreciation expense and certain service costs associated with the placement and use of bingo units are fixed costs  and as we expand into markets that play a limited number of days each week  those fixed costs  as a percent of revenue  are higher  and costs associated with the loss of business in texas 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment for excess uninstalled bingo units of  during fiscal general and administrative 
fiscal general and administrative expenses totaled million compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of costs associated with our executive management and our finance  legal and compliance  information technology  and human resources departments 
several significant events contributed to the increased costs we have reserved million in anticipation of settling pending litigation  in addition to expending  in the fourth quarter as the deductible on settlement of a class action lawsuit  we have expensed  related to the relocation of our corporate office to reno  nevada  primarily duplicate staffing  relocation  and other employee related expenses  we recorded  relating to the cost of employment separation for certain key executives during fiscal  the expense for bad debts increased  and  the recognition of a full year of amortization of goodwill and additional professional fees associated with our acquisition of btc in the second fiscal quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily related to distributor commissions and sales personnel costs 
the decline from to as a percent of revenue in fiscal resulted from our efficiencies achieved by realignment of our sales force regionally to work in conjunction with distributors to promote our products 
research and development 
research and development expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal costs associated with the development of a new colored hand held unit  ted c  and the addition of engineering personnel primarily compose this increase 
interest income expense 
net interest income totaled  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline resulted primarily from our use of million of cash and short term investments for the repurchase of treasury stock 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in the effective rate is due to the effect of the non deductible goodwill from the acquisition of btc as a percentage of pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the million consisted primarily of million of depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions  offset by a net loss of million 
during fiscal  the million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
we used approximately million in investing activities during fiscal compared to million of cash during fiscal the million consisted of million of capital expenditures offset by cash received from the sale of short term investments 
during fiscal  the million of cash used in investing activities consisted of million of capital expenditures and the payment of million associated with the restructuring of a distributor agreement offset by million cash received from the sale of short term investments 
we used  in cash for financing activities during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the  used during fiscal was primarily for payments on long term debt of million  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  the million used during fiscal was primarily due to million used to repurchase our common stock and million in payments on long term debt 
as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
we also have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  na  which has an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option  on which there was no outstanding balance at october  the revolving credit facility expires on april  we expect to renew the revolving credit facility with similar terms 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at october   together with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations and provide for budgeted capital expenditures and liquidity requirements through fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business  and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  strategic opportunities we may pursue could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 
inflation and general economic condition although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
the line of credit expires on april  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
we do not believe  however  that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on our interest expense or available cash 
we currently maintain a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming we had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
we do not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
