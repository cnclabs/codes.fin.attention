item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
as is generally the case  our producing properties in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast often have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop  acquire and produce oil and gas reserves 
we believe that our working capital and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures in accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special rules that are unique to the oil and gas business 
these rules require us to make several difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
these judgments or estimates primarily relate to the capitalization and amortization of costs and the valuation of oil and gas price hedging activities 
our judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies we believe that the policies described below are critical to the reporting of our financial position and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our most significant estimates are remaining proved oil and gas reserves  timing of our future drilling activities  future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties  and the value of derivative positions 
for additional risks associated with these items see other factors affecting our business and financial results in this item accounting for oil and gas activities 
accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special rules that are unique to the oil and gas business 
two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of such costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserves 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method provides for a comparison of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires a comparison of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows of related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are directly related to exploration activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development also are capitalized 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves is a significant component of amortization and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
generally  if reserve volumes increase or decrease  then the amortization rate per unit of production will change inversely 
however  when capitalized costs change  the amortization rate moves in the same direction 
the per unit rate is not affected by production volumes 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms  fpsos  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically occur many years in the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test writedown is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires the most subjective judgments 
given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
with the concurrence of the securities and exchange commission  our impairment calculation uses a hedge adjusted price net realized price after considering cash flow hedges applied to the quantity of proved reserves covered by our hedges 
unevaluated costs 
unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage  unamortized seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are not initially included in our amortization base 
leasehold and seismic costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base if a reduction in value has occurred 
the decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of transferring such costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of management judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
fair value of derivative instruments 
beginning in  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
all of our derivative instruments represent hedges against the price we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
although our derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value  to the extent that changes in those fair values offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production  such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
to the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production  the change is recorded in income in the period it occurs 
we also record the periodic change in the time value component of the option contracts used in our hedging strategy in income in the period the change occurs 
in determining the amounts to be recorded  we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location 
where necessary  we adjust nymex prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent third parties quotations 
writedown of oil and gas properties based on oil and gas prices in effect on december  per mmbtu for gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at december  of million million after tax 
with the concurrence of the securities and exchange commission  the impairment was calculated using a hedge adjusted price 
the writedown would have been million million after tax if we had not used hedge adjusted prices 
because of the volatility of oil and gas prices  no assurance can be given that we will not experience a ceiling test writedown in future periods

the realized price of oil and condensate is reduced by  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
average realized prices include the effect of hedges 
production 
our total oil and gas production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis increased in and in gas production in was impacted by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately five bcfe in the fourth quarter of in response to low commodity prices 
without the curtailment  our production would have increased over levels 
natural gas 
our natural gas production increased over the significant increase was attributable to a balance between acquisitions and drilling 
about half of the production increase in came from the mid continent acquisition  which closed in january our development drilling program in south texas was also a major contributor to our production growth 
following the drilling of six development wells in the east sarita field of south texas  net production increased from about mmcfe d to a peak of nearly mmcfe d in the third quarter of our onshore gulf coast production averaged about mmcfe d in  a increase over the mmcfe d we averaged in the following gulf of mexico development projects were also major contributors west cameron  west cameron a and high island a gains in production were partially offset by natural declines from other producing properties 
in  our natural gas volumes increased over our acquisition of three producing gas fields in south texas in early added about nine bcfe of production 
development projects in the gulf of mexico at eugene island  west cameron and main pass also contributed to the production increase 
crude oil and condensate 
our crude oil production in increased over levels 
the increase in oil production primarily relates to our early acquisition in the mid continent and the success of our drilling efforts 
during  our oil production in australia averaged  bopd and accounted for about of our total oil production 
major development projects in the gulf of mexico that increased our oil production were viosca knoll  eugene island and main pass the increase in oil production primarily relates to the full year affect of our acquisition of two producing oil fields in australia and development projects in the gulf of mexico 
during  our australian oil production averaged about  bopd and accounted for of our total oil production 
major development projects in the gulf of mexico that contributed to our increased oil production in were vermilion  eugene island  high island and main pass and our crude oil and condensate production in was more than our crude oil production in effect of hedging on realized prices 
the following table presents information about the effect of our hedging program on realized prices 
average realized prices ratio of hedged to with without non hedged hedge hedge price natural gas year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  crude oil and condensate year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  the ratio is determined by dividing the realized price which includes the effects of hedging by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities 
net income and revenues 
for  we had net income of million  or per diluted share 
these results include an impairment charge of million  or per diluted share  and a loss of million  or per diluted share  reflecting the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to hedging transactions fas 
this compares to net income of million which includes a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  or per diluted share  or per diluted share  and net income of million  or cents per diluted share 
revenues for were million  above revenues of million 
revenues in were million 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to a increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas prices 
operating expenses 
the following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two years ended december  unit of production amount per mcfe in millions year ended year ended december  percentage december  percentage increase increase decrease decrease united states lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   australia lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation  total operating   total lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   our operating expenses for  exclusive of the ceiling test writedown  on a unit of production basis increased over as the result of higher lease operating  production tax  dd a and g a expense 
the reasons for these increases are described below 
the increased lease operating expense per mcfe reflects higher oilfield service costs in all our domestic focus areas  and relatively higher australian lease operating expenses associated with the operations and maintenance of our two fpsos 
the increase in production and other taxes is primarily related to higher natural gas prices  our expanding onshore gulf coast operations and the acquisition of mid continent properties in early the increase was partly offset by resource rent tax in australia  which was lower in compared to due to unsuccessful drilling efforts 
the increase in the domestic dd a rate is primarily related to lower than expected reserve additions from several of our recently completed wells  increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction and the completion of several higher cost wells 
the increase in the australian dd a rate is primarily a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in the increase on a unit of production basis in g a expense primarily is due to our growing workforce 
performance based compensation  excluding stock compensation expense  was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter ceiling test write down 
performance based compensation  a component of general and administrative expense  was million  or per mcfe  in compared to million  or per mcfe  in the following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two years ended december  unit of production amount per mcfe in millions year ended year ended december  percentage december  percentage increase increase decrease decrease united states lease operating   production and other taxes  transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   australia lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation total operating   total lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   our operating expenses for on a unit of production basis increased over as the result of higher lease operating  production tax and g a expense 
the reasons for these increases are described below 
higher lease operating expense per mcfe reflects increased oilfield service costs in the gulf of mexico  relatively higher australian lease operating expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of our two fpsos and production downtime due to in fill drilling operations during the year in australia 
we experienced higher production and other taxes on a unit of production basis due to increased production onshore  including the acquisition of three producing gas fields in south texas during early australian production and other taxes increased primarily due to higher commodity prices 
the increase in our domestic dd a rate is due to several factors  including increases in the cost of drilling goods and services  platforms and facilities construction  industry transportation costs and the completion of several higher cost wells 
the australian dd a rate increased as a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in the increase in g a expense on a per mcfe basis is primarily the result of an increase in performance based pay  some non recurring expenses associated with a transition to more sophisticated business systems and our growing workforce 
performance based compensation  excluding stock compensation expense  a component of general and administrative expense  increased from million in  or per mcfe  to million in  or per mcfe 
the increase in performance based compensation is a result of our higher earnings 
performance based pay is limited by profitability 
interest expense 
we incur interest expense on our million principal amount senior notes due  our million principal amount senior notes due and on borrowings under our reserve based revolving credit facility and money market credit lines 
outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements may vary significantly from period to period 
distributions are paid on our convertible trust preferred securities we issued in august year ended december  in millions gross interest expense capitalized interest net interest expense distributions on preferred securities total interest expense and distributions in  our higher total interest expense was the result of borrowings related to the lariat acquisition and the issuance of our senior notes in february in  our higher total interest expense was the result of borrowings in january to finance our acquisition of three producing properties in south texas for million 
unrealized commodity derivative income 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we are now required to record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
the million of unrealized income for the year ended december  primarily represents the change in the time value component of the option contracts used in our hedging strategy 
taxes 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was less than the statutory tax rate in because the valuation allowance on our australian net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by million primarily as a result of a substantial increase in estimated taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
our working capital balance is not a good indicator of our liquidity because it fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements 
we had working capital of million as of december  this compares to million at the end of and million at the end of historically  we have funded our oil and gas activities through cash flow from operations  equity capital  public debt and bank borrowings 
debt 
in association with our acquisition of lariat petroleum in early  we borrowed million through our reserve based revolving credit facility 
at year end  we had million outstanding under the credit facility and an additional million outstanding under our money market lines of credit 
at year end  our long term debt was million  which includes our senior notes due of million and our senior notes due of million 
on january   we acquired lariat petroleum for total consideration of approximately million  inclusive of the assumption of debt and certain other obligations of lariat 
the consideration included million shares of our common stock 
we financed the cash portion of the consideration under a new million reserve based revolving credit facility obtained on january  with the chase manhattan bank  as agent 
on february   we placed million of senior notes due the offering was done under an existing shelf registration statement 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
the notes were issued at of par to yield  with interest payable on each march and september  commencing september  the amount available under our credit facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding of the aggregate commitments 
the borrowing base is reduced by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our senior notes million 
the borrowing base is currently million and is redetermined at least semi annually 
no assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the future 
the facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions 
the facility matures on january  at february  we had million available under our credit facility and had outstanding borrowings of million 
we also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by the credit facility to million 
as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit 
our credit arrangements are not subject to any debt rating or similar triggers or conditions 
however  applicable commitment fees and interest rates under our credit facility vary based on our credit rating 
cash flow from operations 
our net cash flow from operations in increased over to million 
the increase is due to significantly higher commodity prices and increased production  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
this compares to cash flow from operations in of million 
net cash flow from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities for was million compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and increased production  offset by increased operating expenses 
capital expenditures 
in  our capital spending totaled million  including million in acquisitions 
the largest component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition of lariat petroleum 
in  we invested million in development  million in domestic exploration and million internationally 
total spending in was million 
our capital spending program included million for acquisitions  million for development  million for domestic exploration and million for international activities 
we have budgeted million for capital spending in the lower budget reflects our anticipation of lower cash flows due to weak commodity prices in early approximately million has been budgeted for development  million for domestic exploration and million for international projects 
the estimated exploratory budget is the largest exploration budget in our history 
acquisitions are opportunistic and are not budgeted under our capital program 
we continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing  size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure budget for will be funded principally from cash flow from operations and working capital 
we do not anticipate additional borrowings under our credit facility or money market lines of credit during unless we make another significant acquisition 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which proved properties are acquired 
contractual obligations and other commitments the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments  other than hedging contracts  by maturity as of december  indefinite less than more than total maturity year years years years in thousands contractual obligations senior notes   senior notes   operating leases      total contractual obligations      other commitments bank revolving credit facility   money market lines of credit   total other commitments    total contractual obligations and other commitments       stock repurchase program on may   we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
through december   we had purchased  shares for total consideration of million  an average of per share 
additional repurchases may be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  purchases will be at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate 
as of february   no shares had been purchased during the first quarter of hedging we enter into various commodity price hedging contracts with respect to a portion of our anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
during  approximately of our production was subject to hedge positions 
approximately of our production in was subject to hedge positions 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counter parties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
at december   bank of montreal  j aron company and barclays bank plc were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production 
such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
please see the discussion in note commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this report

nymex contract price per mmbtu swaps collars period and volume in weighted type of contract mmmbtus average floors ceilings january march swaps  april june swaps collars  we believe there is no material basis risk with respect to our natural gas price hedging contracts because substantially all our gulf coast natural gas production is sold under spot contracts that have historically correlated to the settlement price  and because all of the hedging contracts assumed from lariat are settled against the same pipelines into which our production in oklahoma is sold

the actual cash price we receive  however  generally is about per barrel less than the nymex west texas intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
the estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
with respect to any particular swap transaction  the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such transaction  and we are required to make a payment to the counter party if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such transaction 
for any particular collar transaction  the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction  and we are required to make a payment to the counter party if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such transaction 
for any particular floor transaction  the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction 
we are not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor transaction 
new accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb approved its proposed sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 all business combinations should be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
this statement will apply to all business combinations initiated after june  and to all acquired intangible assets 
this statement generally will supersede accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
adoption of sfas no 
will result in ceasing amortization of goodwill 
this statement should be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
the adoption of this statement will have no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement changes the method of accruing for costs associated with the retirement of fixed assets eg oil gas production facilities  etc it will require that the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset 
implementation of this standard is required no later than january   with earlier application encouraged 
we are currently assessing the impact of this standard 
regulation we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  and taxation 
under these laws  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  congress could  however  reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
from to the present  several major regulatory changes have been implemented by congress and the ferc that affect the economics of natural gas production  transportation and sales 
in addition  the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies  that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation 
the ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the ferc since cannot be predicted 
in addition  many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and ferc final decisions 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters 
some of the ferc s more recent proposals may  however  adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf  or the shelf  provide open access  non discriminatory service 
historically  the ferc has opted not to impose regulatory requirements under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
however  the ferc has issued order no 
 requiring that virtually all non proprietary pipeline transporters of natural gas on the shelf report information on their affiliations  rates and conditions of service 
these reporting requirements apply  in certain circumstances  to operators of production platforms and other facilities on the shelf with respect to gas movements across such facilities 
in a recent decision  the us district court for the district of columbia permanently enjoined the ferc from enforcing order no 
 on the basis that the ferc did not possess the requisite rule making authority under the ocsla for issuing order no 
the ferc s appeal of the court s decision is pending in the u 
s 
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal  nor can we predict what further action the ferc will take with respect to this matter 
in addition  the ferc retains authority under ocsla to exercise jurisdiction over entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction if necessary to ensure non discriminatory access to service on the shelf 
we do not believe that any ferc action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are currently not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers 
federal leases 
the majority of our us operations are located on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the mms 
these leases are issued through competitive bidding  contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas  and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms has issued a rule that amended its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
this rule provides that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
the lawfulness of the new rule has been challenged in federal court 
we cannot predict what action the mms will take on this matter 
we believe that these rules will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore louisiana  texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  drilling permits  bonds and reports concerning operations 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing of waste materials  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act of  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires responsible parties to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs 
under opa and a mms rule  responsible parties of covered offshore facilities that have a worst case oil spill of more than  barrels must demonstrate financial assurance in amounts ranging from at least million in state waters to at least million in federal waters  with higher amounts of up to million in certain limited circumstances where the mms believes the additional coverage is warranted  based on the risk of covered operations or the size of a worst case oil spill 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with cwa  including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans 
ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  legislation has been proposed in congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes  which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
if such legislation were to be enacted  it could increase our operating costs  as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under the superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
these recently acquired onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to remediate such properties 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment 
there can be no assurance  however  that current regulatory requirements will not change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered 
other factors affecting our business and financial results oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas 
these prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
among the factors that can cause fluctuations are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  weather conditions  the price of foreign imports  world wide economic conditions  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  the level of consumer demand  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income and stockholders equity 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
generally requires us to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
each quarter we must record changes in the value of our hedges  which could result in significant fluctuations in net income and stockholders equity from period to period 
see note commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements 
our future success depends on our ability to replace the reserves that we produce 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
as is generally the case  our producing properties in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast often have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
we must do this even during periods of low oil and gas prices when it may be difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance these activities 
without successful exploration or acquisition activities  our reserves  production and revenues will decline rapidly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial expenditures to find  develop  acquire and produce oil and gas reserves 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our credit arrangements to fund planned capital expenditures in if  however  lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit facility  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete our drilling program unless we raise additional funds through debt or equity financings 
we cannot assure you that debt or equity financing  cash generated by operations or borrowing capacity will be available to meet these requirements 
reserve estimates are inherently uncertain and depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
if oil and gas prices decrease  we may be required to take writedowns 
there is a risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting method  the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  using period end oil and gas prices and a discount factor  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this type of charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities  but it will reduce the book value of our stockholders equity 
we review the carrying value of our properties quarterly  based on prices in effect including the value of our hedge positions as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results 
the carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis 
therefore  while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown  our properties in other countries could be unaffected 
once incurred  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties 
many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies 
drilling is a high risk activity 
our future success will depend on the success of our drilling program 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our drilling and development programs and acquisitions  or result in loss of properties 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect us 
we have risks associated with our foreign operations 
we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in areas where we can use our core competencies 
to date  we have expanded our operations to australia and china 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
exploration in deepwater involves greater operating and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths 
these risks could result in substantial losses 
we have developed a three phase strategy to enter the deepwater play 
deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure 
we will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells we may drill 
in addition  much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters 
as a result  development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment  resulting in significant financial and operating risks 
other independent oil and gas companies limited access to capital may change our exploration and development plans 
many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities 
as a result  some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
these problems could cause us to change  suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project 
forward looking information this report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as production targets  anticipated production rates  planned capital expenditures  the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves  wells planned to be drilled in the future  our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable  this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties 
actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting our business described above under the captions regulation and other factors affecting our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices as independent oil and gas producer  our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of natural gas  crude oil and hydrocarbon condensate 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we utilize and expect to continue to utilize hedging transaction with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption hedging in item of this report 
interest rates at december   we had approximately million of outstanding long term debt million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due subject to a fixed rate of interest 
additionally  we had million of convertible trust preferred securities bearing a fixed distribution rate of 
however  the million outstanding under our reserve based credit facility and money market lines of credit are subject to a rate of interest that fluctuates based on short term interest rates 
because the majority of our long term obligations were at fixed rates  approximately of our total debt at december   we consider our interest rate exposure at such date to be minimal 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change up or down in the floating rate approximately basis points applicable to our borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit would be million 
at december   we had no open interest rate hedge positions to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rates our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
