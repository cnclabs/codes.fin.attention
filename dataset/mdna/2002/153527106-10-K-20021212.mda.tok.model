for the purposes of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of income loss before income tax provision benefit and cumulative effect of accounting change  excluding income and losses associated with equity investees  and before fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  the portion of rental expense under operating leases deemed by management to be representative of the interest factor and amortization of deferred financing costs 
in the fiscal years ended september  and september   our fixed charges exceeded the sum of our earnings and fixed charges by million and million  respectively 
ebitda is calculated as income loss from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be used as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is included in this form k because it is a basis upon which our management assesses financial performance 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
included in ebitda are other charges and expenses incurred by us as a result of unusual events  which management believes are not indicative of costs to be incurred in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview central garden pet company is a leading marketer and producer of quality branded products for the pet and lawn and garden supplies markets 
we are one of the largest companies in the fragmented  billion us pet supplies industry and one of the largest companies in the billion us lawn and garden supplies industry 
our pet products include pet bird and small animal food  wild bird seed  aquarium products  flea  tick  mosquito and other insect control products  edible bones  cages  carriers  pet books  and other dog  cat  reptile and small animal products 
these products are sold under a number of brand names  including kaytee  all glass aquarium  zodiac  nylabone  tfh and four paws 
our lawn and garden products include grass seed  wild bird seed  weed and insect control products  decorative outdoor patio products and ant control products 
these products are sold under a number of brand names  including pennington  norcal pottery  matthews four seasons  amdro and grant s 
in fiscal  our consolidated net sales were billion  of which our pet products segment  or pet products  accounted for million and our lawn and garden products segment  or garden products  accounted for million 
our income from operations was million  of which pet products accounted for million and garden products accounted for million  before corporate expenses and eliminations of million 
background during the past several years  we have transitioned to a leading marketer and producer of branded products from a traditional pet and lawn and garden supplies distributor 
we undertook this transition because we recognized the opportunity to build a portfolio of leading brands and improve profitability by capitalizing on our knowledge of the pet and lawn and garden supplies sectors  our strong relationships with retailers and our nationwide sales and logistics network 
our goal was to diversify our business and improve operating margins by establishing a portfolio of leading brands 
since  we have acquired numerous branded products companies and product lines  including wellmark and four paws in fiscal  kaytee products  tfh and pennington seed in fiscal  norcal pottery in fiscal  and amdro and all glass aquarium in fiscal while expanding our branded products business  we experienced adverse events in our distribution business 
from to  we were the master distributor of round up and ortho products 
in january  the scotts company  one of our largest distribution suppliers at the time  acquired ortho and became the marketing agent for round up 
in july  scotts terminated its relationship with us 
due to these events  we significantly downsized our garden distribution operations and closed a total of facilities from fiscal to fiscal we have incurred significant legal expenses associated with lawsuits with scotts and others 
in fiscal  we integrated our sales and logistics networks into our pet and lawn and garden products businesses to allow us to focus resources and provide strategic sales support for our brands 
virtually all of our sales before fiscal were from distributing other manufacturers products 
since then  our branded product sales have grown to approximately million  or approximately of total sales  in fiscal during this same period  sales of other manufacturers products have declined to approximately million  or approximately of total sales  and our gross profit margins improved from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative other charges income from operations interest expense  net other income income tax income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net loss fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal the decrease is due to a million decrease in garden products and a million decrease in pet products 
the decreases in both garden products and pet products relate to reductions in sales of other manufacturers products resulting from facility closures in fiscal and  as well as the business closure of two customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  kal kan  a supplier of dog food  and arch chemical  a major pool chemical supplier  each terminated their relationships with us to distribute their products directly to retailers 
in fiscal  sales of kal kan products were approximately million  and sales of arch products were approximately million 
the reduced revenues from sales of other manufacturers products were partially offset by increases in sales of our own pet branded products and lawn and garden branded products 
contributing to these increases were increased consumer acceptance of new products  continued strength of methoprene sales  the introduction of several new products and upgraded packaging 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased gross profit from sales of our own branded products and cost improvements  partially offset by decreased sales of other manufacturers products 
garden products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased sales of our own branded products  partially offset by the effects of lower sales of other manufacturers products 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross profit in for both pet products and garden products was inventory and inventory related write downs of million  which occurred in  but not in fiscal  and are discussed further in the fiscal and fiscal comparison below 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting increases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
the percentage improvement was principally due to higher sales of our own branded products  a favorable mix of sales  and reduced sales of other manufacturers products  which generally result in lower gross margins as compared to sales of our own branded products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from during fiscal to for fiscal a portion of the decrease was due to million in goodwill amortization incurred in fiscal  which did not occur in fiscal as we ceased amortizing goodwill upon the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal selling and delivery expenses decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal both pet products and garden products shared in the decrease  which was principally due to the overall decrease in sales of other manufacturers products 
included in fiscal selling and delivery expense was approximately million attributable to the closure of pet products branches and increased freight costs to service out of market customers transferred from garden products distribution centers closed in fiscal facilities expenses remained flat at million in both fiscal and increased facilities expenses at pet products  principally due to shutdown costs related to the kal kan termination  offset a decrease at garden products  due to the decreased number of sales and logistics centers 
warehouse and administrative expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal garden products decreased million  pet products decreased million and corporate decreased million 
the reductions in garden products and pet products were largely due to the impact of facility closures as well as the elimination of costs associated with certain personnel reductions and bad debt write offs incurred in fiscal  which were at lower levels in fiscal the decrease at corporate related to the elimination of million of goodwill amortization in fiscal  upon our adoption of sfas no 
these decreases were partially offset by increased legal and litigation related expenses and insurance premium costs in fiscal other income other income increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to million of life insurance proceeds  partially offset by million in charges related to the write off of goodwill associated with an unsuccessful equity method investment 
earnings from equity method investments were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal interest expense net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is due to both lower average short term borrowings and lower average short term interest rates 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the average short term interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate  before the cumulative effect of accounting change  for fiscal was compared to an effective rate of in fiscal for fiscal  our marginal tax rate was 
the difference between the marginal tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to non taxable insurance proceeds recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal resulted primarily from the inclusion of non deductible goodwill amortization  which ceased upon adoption of sfas no 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales decreased million  or  to  million from  million for fiscal the decrease is due to a million decrease in net sales of garden products offset  in part  by an increase in net sales of pet products of million 
adjusting for newly acquired operations  the sales decrease in garden products was million and in pet products net sales would have resulted in a decrease of million 
the decrease in garden products related to the sales and logistics group  which was expected after we closed distribution centers in late fiscal as a result of the termination of our distribution relationship with scotts 
the sales decrease in pet products was attributable to the closure of three pet distribution centers during fiscal and a decline in kaytee sales of wild birdseed 
in fiscal  arch  a major pool chemical supplier  and kal kan  a supplier of dog food  notified us that they each intended to terminate their relationship with us and distribute their products directly to retailers 
in fiscal  sales of arch products were approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
sales of kal kan products to independent retailers were approximately million in fiscal the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was estimated to be million based on historical customer profitability 
in addition  the kal kan business lost included approximately million of fees related to shipments to petsmart 
the loss of the kal kan business contributed to our decision to close two smaller pet distribution centers during the first quarter of fiscal with a third facility closure in february gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  from million during fiscal to million for fiscal adjusting for newly acquired operations  gross profit would have decreased by  or million 
the decrease in gross profit dollars relates principally to lower revenues in the sales and logistics group within garden products  while pet products generated approximately the same gross profit dollars as in fiscal gross profit for both segments was adversely affected by inventory and inventory related write downs in fiscal in pet products  tfh reduced the carrying value of their book inventory by million and wrote off million of pre press publication costs 
the inventory write down was primarily the result of a continuing sales decline in pet books  which in turn created excess and obsolete book inventory 
the decline in pet book sales related principally to reduced floor space allocated to books by the large retailers coupled with a reduction in the number of titles they carry 
in garden products  pennington wrote down its bahia grass seed inventory by million as a result of a significant decline in the market price for that particular variety 
in connection with the closure of distribution centers in fiscal  management  at the existing centers  evaluated the inventory at these facilities to determine the amount of potential overstock and to assess how much inventory could be moved to those locations which would remain open 
this evaluation resulted in a write down of million in fiscal to adjust the inventory to its estimated realizable value 
due to the age of the remaining inventory combined with the fact that more of this inventory became obsolete due to packaging changes made by the manufacturer  management s evaluation of its estimated realizable value resulted in a further write down of million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the percentage improvement was principally due to a reduction in sales of other manufacturers products within garden products  which accounted for a significantly lower percentage of total sales 
sales of other manufacturers products generally result in lower gross margins compared to sales of our own branded products 
overall  garden products gross profit improved from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling and delivery expenses decreased by million  which was net of a million increase related to newly acquired operations  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in 
table of contents selling and delivery expenses associated with existing business in fiscal related principally to a sales decline in garden products compared with fiscal included in fiscal selling and delivery expense was approximately million attributable to the closure of three pet products branches during fiscal and increased freight costs to service out of market customers transferred from garden products distribution centers closed in fiscal facilities expense decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in fiscal is approximately million related to newly acquired businesses 
this increase was more than offset by decreased expenses from the closure of the distribution centers  the majority of which was in garden products 
warehouse and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately million related to newly acquired businesses 
of the million increase from existing operations  approximately million was attributable to pet products  million to garden products and million to corporate 
the increase of million compared with fiscal related principally to additional bad debt provisions of million  of which million related to two large garden products customers who went bankrupt or ceased operations during the last month of fiscal  increased legal and professional fees of million  which included in fiscal approximately million associated with the phoenix warehouse fire and the litigation work related to the scotts and tfh lawsuits  an increase in general and medical insurance of million  increased depreciation and goodwill amortization of million  as a result of the closure of garden products and pet products locations  there was a significant decrease in both sales and inventory levels  which resulted in a million increase in the amount of purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs charged to warehouse and administration expense  and not included as inventory costs  compared to the prior year  increased information systems costs of million primarily new systems being implemented to centralize sales  marketing  inventory and financial data  an increase in personnel and other professional costs for research and development of million  and increases in office rents and general increases in normal operating expenses of million 
interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to new long term borrowings resulting principally from the businesses acquired  offset by lower average short term interest rates 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal the average short term interest rates for the fiscal years and were and  respectively 
income taxes during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the tax benefit was affected by certain goodwill amortization  which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
ebitda ebitda is a basis used by our chief operating decision makers to measure our operating results and to measure segment profitability and performance 
we calculate ebitda as income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
management believes ebitda is meaningful to investors because it provides analysis of operating results using the same measures used by our chief operating decision makers 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ebitda does not take into account certain changes in assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes which can affect cash flows 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  september  september  in thousands income from operations depreciation and amortization ebitda other charges and unusual expenses as a result of the loss of the scotts business  the downsizing of our lawn and garden distribution business and the other events described below  we incurred other charges and expenses in fiscal  and  which management believes to be unusual in nature 
they are considered unusual in nature because they were incurred as a result of unusual events  and management does not believe that the nature or level of these costs are indicative of those expected to be incurred in the future 
these expenses are included in our income from operations and in the ebitda amounts discussed above

see item legal proceedings for more information 
pre press publication and inventory write downs represented inventory at closed distribution centers that was determined to be overstock or too expensive to relocate 
in fiscal  legal and professional expenses represented continued legal fees relating to litigation with scotts  pharmacia and tfh and the phoenix fire litigation 
pre press publication and inventory write downs represented a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of tfh book inventory to its estimated realizable value and associated write off of pre press publication costs  a million write down of bahia grass seed inventory at pennington as a result of a significant decline in the market price for that particular variety  and further write downs relating to obsolete inventory at the closed distribution centers 
closed branches expense represented additional costs incurred in fiscal related to the closing of distribution centers in fiscal which were not included in fiscal in other charges in accordance with gaap and the closure of three smaller under performing pet products distribution centers during fiscal and a small manufacturing facility which produced nylon collars and leashes

goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an impairment approach 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in prior business combinations  ceased upon the adoption of the standard  which we adopted for the fiscal year beginning september  as required by sfas no 
 we performed our goodwill impairment analysis and recorded a non cash charge to write down goodwill in garden products by million million after tax and in pet products by million million after tax 
the following financial information for fiscal and is presented as if sfas no 
was adopted at the beginning of fiscal september  september  in thousands  except per share amounts reported net loss goodwill amortization  net of tax net income loss  as adjusted basic and diluted loss per share reported loss goodwill amortization adjusted income loss per share inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
weather and seasonality historically  our sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve 
additionally  garden products business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net sales occurred in the second 
table of contents and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income is typically generated in this period  which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of equity and debt securities to the public 
historically  our business has been seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter  accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
since our short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  this quarter is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and  consequently  our ability to borrow is at its lowest 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the reduction in sales of products manufactured by other parties as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern has become somewhat less significant 
we service two broad markets pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies 
our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to carry large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately of garden products aggregate sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products  this seasonality requires them to move large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak selling periods 
to encourage distributors to carry large amounts of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
cash generated from operating activities increased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to improved operational results and decreased inventory and accounts receivable levels  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
income from operations increased million 
the declining inventory and accounts payable levels are the result of management s efforts to reduce inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million primarily as a result of payments made to acquire companies in fiscal net cash used in financing activities increased to million dollars 
during fiscal  we made net debt payments of million on our lines of credit and net debt payments of million on our long term debt  partially offset by proceeds from employee option exercises 
the table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to us and their associated expiration dates in millions maximum commercial commitments less than year years total amount committed revolving line of credit with congress financial corporation revolving line of credit with sun trust revolving line of credit with bankone total commercial commitments available borrowings are subject to the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory maintained by us 
we have a million line of credit with congress financial corporation western 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon the value of assets eligible for inclusion in the borrowing base 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate either equal to libor plus or the prime rate  at our option  and is secured by 
table of contents a significant amount of our assets 
at september   we had million of outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
this line of credit contains certain financial covenants  such as minimum tangible net worth  ebitda and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any acquisition of a business 
our pennington subsidiary also has a million line of credit 
at september   there were million of outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
interest related to this line is based on a rate either equal to libor plus or the prime rate  at our option 
our all glass aquarium subsidiary also has a million line of credit 
as of september   there were no outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line

the table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year in millions contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total revolving line of credit facilities long term debt operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations in november  we issued million of subordinated convertible notes 
the principal amount of the notes will become due on november   unless converted into common stock by the holders or redeemed by us prior to maturity 
if the notes are not converted  we may be required to offer additional debt or equity securities to obtain the funds that would be required to repay the notes 
we believe that a number of different financing options are available to us and any necessary financing will be obtained prior to the maturity of these notes 
excluding the potential impact of the maturity of the notes  we believe that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under our lines of credit  and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months  including approximately million for the construction of a wild bird seed plant scheduled for completion in october as part of our growth strategy  we have engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past  and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  we may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
will be effective for our fiscal year we are evaluating what impact  if any  this standard may have on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issues sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including those of discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet been incurred 
sfas no 
also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the 
table of contents entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year  and are generally to be applied prospectively 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for any restructuring activities initiated after december  critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  accounts receivable and inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance reserves and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
although options are available  we have chosen the intrinsic value method to account for common stock incentive awards 
this accounting policy has been applied consistently for all years presented 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results by using apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
although not all inclusive  we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies  which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for credit losses and disputed balances resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance based on both specific identification and historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  or we were not able to demonstrate the validity of amounts due  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory  which primarily consists of lawn and garden products and pet supplies finished goods  is stated at the lower of first in first out fifo cost or market 
cost includes certain indirect purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs including certain salary and data processing costs incurred to acquire or manufacture inventory  costs to unload  process and put away shipments received to prepare them to be picked for orders  and certain overhead costs 
we compute the amount of such costs capitalized to inventory based on an estimate of costs related to the procurement and processing of inventory to prepare it for sale compared to total product purchases 
when necessary  we have reduced the carrying value of our inventory if market conditions indicate that we will not recover the carrying cost upon sale 
future downward changes in market related to our products would result in an additional charge to income in the period in which such conditions occur 

table of contents goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million non cash impairment of our goodwill as of september   which was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of our fourth quarter 
we use projected future operating results and cash flows of our reporting units to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of the associated goodwill 
if estimated future results of operations differed from those projections used by management  or if alternative valuation methodologies had been used in determining the reporting units fair value  the cumulative effect of accounting change charge may have been different than the amount we recorded 
future downward changes in the operating results of our reporting units may result in additional charges to income in the period in which such conditions occur during our annual goodwill assessment process 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets for potential impairment based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
long lived assets are included in impairment evaluations when events and circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of impairment losses for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have recorded asset impairment charges when the carrying value of certain assets was in excess of their fair value 
should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of these assets change  or management change plans for usage of certain assets  additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes result primarily from bad debt allowances  inventory write downs  depreciation and nondeductible reserves 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  any adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
benefits and claims liabilities we have recorded estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs under self insurance programs with per occurrence and aggregate limits on losses 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what we estimated  or costs of medical care increase beyond what we anticipate  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges to income may be required 
commitments and contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several significant legal matters as well as other matters incidental to our business  the disposition of which are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we use our best estimates to determine the probable outcome and costs associated with the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of potential litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by adverse developments or changes in management s strategy related to these proceedings 

table of contents risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
we may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space  price demands and other conditions 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just in time basis 
this requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand  which could in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirement 
a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales  profitability and cash flow 
for example  in fiscal  kmart and house home filed for bankruptcy and  as a result  we wrote off million in receivables 
we continually monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate 
despite these efforts  another bankruptcy ling by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business 
wal mart  our largest customer  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in addition  although each accounted for less than of our net sales  home depot  lowe s  petsmart and petco are also significant customers and  together with wal mart  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the market shares of all of these key retailers have increased during the last several years and may continue to increase in future years 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales  income from operations and cash flow to decline 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations and cash flow 
we cannot be certain that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue 
we believe that our past performance has been based upon  and our future success will depend upon  in part  our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop  market and produce new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and production of any new products or product innovations  or develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents seeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had  and could have  a negative impact on us 
our financial results depend to some extent on the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers 
in particular  our pennington and kaytee subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird feed and grass seed 
historically  market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
for example  a significant rise in our white millet acquisition cost in late and had a negative impact on profitability of bird feed products in fiscal in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  we would be required to increase sales prices to avoid margin deterioration 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by us may affect the volumes of future shipments 
in fiscal and  garden products was adversely affected by a worldwide oversupply of certain grass seeds brought on by a combination of weather issues and the bankruptcy sale of a competitor  generally poor economic conditions in agriculture  and cattle diseases that reduce demand for seed 
if the oversupply extends into fiscal  our operating results and cash flows could suffer 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices  we enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird feed and grass seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since these contracts cover only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
in contrast  if market prices for grains decrease because of a lack of demand  we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market 
competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy  achieve profitability  or maintain relationships with existing customers 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
we compete against numerous other companies  some of which are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do 
our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers 
our largest competitor in pet supplies products is hartz mountain and our largest competitor in lawn and garden products is the scotts company 
since its acquisition of the ortho line of lawn and garden products from pharmacia corporation formerly monsanto in  scotts dominant position in the lawn and garden industry has been a significant competitive disadvantage for garden products 
to compete effectively  among other things  we must maintain our relationships with key retailers  continually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers  maintain strict quality standards  deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices  and effectively integrate acquired companies and adapt them to our internal controls 
competition could cause lower sales volumes  price reductions  reduced profits or losses  or loss of market share 
our inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks 
we have completed acquisitions since and intend to grow through the acquisition of additional companies 
we are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  additional financing  if available  could increase leverage  dilute equity  or both  the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  and the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of goodwill related to previous acquisitions in accordance with sfas we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  acquire  or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial difficulties 
in future acquisitions  we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather  either of which could impact our cash flow and operating results 
because our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer  garden products business is seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products sales and of our total sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income and cash flow is generated in this period 
our working capital needs and our borrowings generally peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations and cash flow could also be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations and cash flow were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the united states 
our operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales  net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include 
table of contents weather conditions during peak gardening seasons and seasonality  shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  shifts in demand for pet products  changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  the effect of acquisitions  including the costs of acquisitions that are not completed  and economic stability of retail customers 
these fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock 
our convertible notes mature in november and our senior credit facilities expire during the next two years  and we must  repay  extend or refinance them 
in november  we issued million of subordinated convertible notes 
the principal amount of the notes will become due on november   unless converted into common stock by the holders or redeemed by us prior to maturity 
if the notes are not converted  we may be required to offer additional debt or equity securities to obtain the funds that would be required to repay the notes 
although we believe that a number of different financing options are available to us  we cannot assure you that we will be able to repay or refinance the notes before maturity on favorable terms  or at all 
similarly  our two principal senior credit facilities are scheduled to expire in september and july if these facilities are not repaid prior to their expiration  we will be required to extend or refinance these credit facilities to meet our working capital requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend or refinance these facilities on favorable terms  or at all 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief operating officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of our pennington subsidiary 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
some of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and have internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
in addition  while we do not anticipate having to make  and historically have not had to make  significant capital expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required 

table of contents in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
accordingly  we may become liable  either contractually or by operation of law  for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us  or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property 
with our extensive acquisition history  we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities 
given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at these properties  there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified  even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted 
while we are not subject to any existing remediation obligations  future events  such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement  or the discovery of currently unknown contamination  may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material 
see item legal proceedings phoenix fire 
the products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
we have pending litigation which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are a party to certain legal proceedings  including the litigation between us and scotts and litigation arising from a fire which destroyed our phoenix  arizona facility 
we are currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of our legal proceedings 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings  they could result in significant diversion of time by our management 
the results of our pending legal proceedings  including any potential settlements  are uncertain and we cannot assure you that the outcome of these disputes will not adversely affect our operating results 
see item legal proceedings 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of central 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  controlled approximately of the voting power of our capital stock 
accordingly  he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of our common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on our bank lines of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt had changed by compared to actual rates  interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains and grass seed 
to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability  we enter into contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed purchases 
such contracts are primarily entered into to ensure commodity availability to us in the future 
as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would result in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  foreign currency risks 
to date  we have had minimal sales outside of the united states and  therefore  have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
purchases made from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
