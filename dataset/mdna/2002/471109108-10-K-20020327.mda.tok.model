sales and marketing our sales and marketing staff consists of individuals with considerable technical background in the field of metallurgy 
these individuals focus on leveraging our core capabilities in zinc metallurgy and electrochemistry to exploit new market opportunities 
the sales and marketing staff works closely with our engineering and technical services group to deliver products to the customer 
we maintain a website which contains technical information regarding the advantageous physical properties of zinc versus other metals 
manufacturing in our greeneville  tennessee facility  we manufacture alloys of zinc strip and fabricated zinc products in a number of configurations for our customers 
we have five lines used to slit the coils into widths specific by customers 
many customers require less than the full master coil diameters  so the large coils are broken down into the requested diameters at the time they are slit 
we also produce coin blanks stamped from slit coils using one of five high speed presses 
the stamped blanks are then rimmed and put into one of three electroplating lines where the copper coating is applied 
raw materials we purchase special high grade zinc ingot and a variety of metals  including copper  lead  titanium  magnesium  manganese and other alloys  to produce the zinc alloys we use in our various applications 
these alloys have been developed by our technical staff to meet the specific physical and chemical characteristics of the finished product applications 
we purchase zinc ingot based on market prices quoted on the london metals exchange month end average price from a variety of suppliers 
certain customers  including the united states mint  provide their own purchased zinc that is utilized to manufacture product at a toll conversion price 
we purchase copper for both alloying and plating purposes based on market prices quoted on the new york commodities and metals exchange 
as with zinc ingot  the united states mint supplies the required copper for one cent coin blanks 
we also purchase a variety of chemicals for production and waste treatment  primarily for use in copper plating 
prices for chemicals are negotiated with suppliers based on market supply and demand conditions and volume purchase levels

sales and marketing we concentrate our marketing efforts in those markets that require high levels of precision  quality  and engineering expertise 
there is potential for continued growth in all product lines  especially in the healthcare market  where our quality  service and clean room molding operations are critical competitive factors 
manufacturing we manufacture at three facilities located in greenville  south carolina  reedsville  pennsylvania  and springfield  missouri 
the injection molding process involves converting plastic resin pellets to a fluid state through elevated temperature and pressure  at which point the resin is injected into a mold where it is then formed into a finished part 
molded parts are usually small  intricate components that are produced using multi cavity tooling 
post molding operations employ robotics and automation for assembly and packaging 
raw materials we purchase resin from regular commercial sources of supply and  in most cases  multiple sources 
the supply and demand for plastic resins are subject to cyclical and other market factors 
competition the market for injection molded plastics is highly competitive 
we concentrate our marketing efforts in those markets that require high levels of precision  quality  engineering expertise and cleanliness 
we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors by developing long lasting relationships with a number of specialty tooling manufacturers and by possessing strong design capabilities 
we believe that the quality and cleanliness of our facilities provides another competitive advantage for us 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to capture new injection molding programs as they come to market  as well as benefit from continued outsourcing trends among original equipment manufacturers 
industrial plastics our industrial plastics business manufactures thermoformed white goods for a variety of customers in our fort smith  arkansas facility 
we also manufacture and sell extruded plastic sheet and roll stock products in smooth  textured and laminated finishes for a variety of customers

our experienced sales and marketing teams  which include members of senior management  emphasize to the customer our total capabilities 
marketing  product design and manufacturing personnel interface with multiple contacts within the customer organization from the initiation of a new program through production 
manufacturing our products are produced through a thermoforming process 
thermoforming is an operation in which plastic sheet is converted into a formed product through single or twin sheet vacuum or pressure formed in conjunction with the application of heat 
after the product is formed  the process of removing the excess material  or trimming  is generally performed by automated equipment programmed to execute the appropriate steps to produce the finished part to the customer s specifications 
we have the capability to provide value added services such as assembling components into finished parts  performing various finishing operations  or attaching hardware or other items to a thermoformed part 
raw materials we purchase resin directly for use in the manufacture of extruded sheet and also purchase plastic sheet from third party suppliers in those instances where we are unable to provide for our needs internally 
these raw materials are obtained from regular commercial sources of supply and  in most cases  multiple sources 
the supply and demand for plastic resins are subject to cyclical and other market factors 
under our agreement with whirlpool  we purchase resin used in the production of whirlpool products under a supply contract that whirlpool negotiates with resin suppliers 
this agreement provides us protection from price fluctuations in materials for whirlpool products  while we can usually pass through any changes in material pricing to its other customers

see zinc products under the materials based group segment discussion above 
the united states government retains the right to terminate such contracts at its convenience 
however  if the contract is terminated  the company is entitled to be reimbursed for allowable costs and profits to the date of termination relating to authorized work performed to such date 
the united states government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 
since entering into a contract with the company in  the united states government has not terminated the penny blank supply arrangement

further  the cost of maintaining compliance has not  and we believe  in the future  will not  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
we have attempted to limit our exposure to such liabilities through contractual indemnities and other mechanisms 
we do not believe that any of our existing remediation obligations  including at third party sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  will have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations or financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management and corporate office reorganization on september   our board of directors appointed martin e 
franklin as our chairman and chief executive officer and ian gh ashken as our vice chairman  chief financial officer and secretary 
on october   we announced the closing of our indianapolis  indiana corporate office 
corporate functions have been transitioned to our new headquarters in rye  new york  and our consumer products division in muncie  indiana 
following the sale of the tpd assets and the third quarter appointment of new executive management  we reorganized our business segments to reflect the new business and management strategy 
we are now organized into two distinct segments consumer products and materials based group 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current segment definitions 
divestitures in effective november   we sold the tpd assets to wilbert  inc for million in cash  a million noninterest bearing one year note  and the assumption of certain identified liabilities 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million in related to the sale 
the cash proceeds from the sale were used to pay down our term debt 
as a result of the sale  in january we recovered approximately million of federal income taxes paid in and  received a further federal income tax refund of million in march and are anticipating an additional 
million federal income tax refund from the enactment  in march  of the job creation and workers assistance act of by utilizing the carryback of a tax net operating loss generated in see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
this refund was used to pay down our debt 
the combined net sales of the tpd assets included in our historical results were million in through the date of sale  million in and million in operating earnings losses associated with these assets were million in  million in and million in effective november   we sold our majority interest in microlin  llc  a developer of proprietary battery and fluid delivery technology  for  in cash plus contingent consideration based upon future performance through december  and the cancellation of future funding requirements 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million in related to the sale 
excluding the tpd assets  microlin  llc and other divested businesses  alltrista s net sales for  and would have been million  million and million  respectively  and alltrista s ebitda for  and would have been million  million and million  respectively 
recent developments we expect that the net sales and operating income of our materials based group segment for the three months ended march  will be lower than the comparable period in our zinc business has experienced reduced sales to the united states mint  which announced in the fourth quarter of that it was implementing an inventory reduction program for all coinage 
we anticipate that this inventory reduction program will result in lower sales and earnings for zinc compared to prior years until the fourth quarter of results of operations comparison of and we reported consolidated net sales of million in  a decrease of from sales of million in our loss before interest and taxes for the year ended december  was million  including special charges and reorganization expenses of million and a total loss on divestiture of assets and product lines of million 
for the year ended december   excluding all of these one time items  earnings before interest and taxes was million 
these results compare to earnings before interest  taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  of million 
sales of consumer products were relatively flat in compared to domestic increases were offset by canadian decreases due to unfavorable weather conditions and customers carrying higher levels of inventory over from sales within the materials based group for decreased by million due primarily to i lower demand for industrial thermoformed parts part of the divested tpd assets in the heavy truck and material handling markets  ii the fact that full year sales in did not include december sales for the divested tpd assets  and iii the decline in sales of zinc products resulting from lower coinage sales to the united states mint  due to the mint s stated objective of reducing inventory 
gross margin percentages increased to in from in gross margin increased for consumer products due primarily to cost efficiencies which continued during as the benefits of the segment s sap system implementation continued to be realized 
this increase was offset by a decrease in gross margin for the materials based group in due primarily to lower sales of plastic thermoformed parts part of the divested tpd assets resulting from decreased demand in the heavy truck  material handling and manufactured housing markets 
smaller orders reduced the length of production runs  and  thus  diminished operating efficiencies 
lower sales of injection molded precision consumer products also contributed to the decline in margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in consumer products expenses decreased primarily due to lower expenses associated with sales and marketing  warehousing and shipping 
expenses within the materials based group decreased primarily as a result of the cost savings realized due to a third quarter realignment and consolidation of our divested thermoformed operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in due primarily to lower overall sales 
goodwill amortization decreased from million in to million in due primarily to our november sale of the tpd assets 
we incurred net special charges credits and reorganization expenses of million and million for and  respectively 
these amounts were comprised of the following in millions costs to evaluate strategic options discharge of deferred compensation obligations separation costs for former officers stock option compensation corporate restructuring costs costs to exit facilities reduction of long term performance based compensation litigation charges items related to divested thermoforming operations during  certain participants in our deferred compensation plans agreed to forego balances in those plans in exchange for loans from us in the same amounts 
the loans  which were completed during  bear interest at the applicable federal rate and require the individuals to secure a life insurance policy having the death benefit equivalent to the amount of the loan payable to us 
all accrued interest and principal on the loans mature and are payable upon the death of the participant and their spouse 
we recognized million of pretax income during related to the discharge of the deferred compensation obligations 
separation costs for former officers were associated with the management reorganization described above 
during september  options were granted to participants under our stock option plan 
because the options granted under this new plan were still subject to stockholder approval at the time of grant  the options resulted in a one time charge of million  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of  following stockholder approval of the stock option plan on december during the fourth quarter of  we incurred corporate restructuring costs in the amount of million 
these include costs related to the transitioning of the corporate office function from indianapolis  indiana to rye  new york and muncie  indiana  costs to reincorporate in delaware and to hold a special meeting of shareholders  and related costs including professional fees 
in late  we consolidated our home canning metal closure production from our bernardin  ltd 
toronto  ontario facility into our muncie  indiana manufacturing operation 
the total cost to exit the toronto facility was million and includes a million loss on the sale and disposal of equipment  and million of employee severance costs 
we will continue to distribute our products in canada through bernardin  ltd 
during  items recognized related to the divested tpd assets included a pre tax gain of million in connection with an insurance recovery associated with a property casualty 
also in we vacated our former triangle plastics facility in independence  iowa and integrated personnel and capabilities into its other operating and distribution facilities in the area 
the total cost to exit this iowa facility was million and includes million in future lease obligations and an additional million of costs related to the leased facility 
during  we recorded a pretax gain of million related to a reduction in long term performance based compensation 
also during  we reached settlements in legal disputes incurring million in net settlement and legal expenses 
in  we recognized a million pretax loss on the sale of the tpd assets and a million pre tax loss on the sale of its interest in microlin  llc 
net interest expense in was million compared to million for the effects of lower average borrowings outstanding and lower interest rates during were offset by the write off of million of previously deferred debt issuance and amendment costs in connection with the november amendment of our term loan and revolving credit facility 
our effective interest rate for the year ended december  was 
as a result of decreasing interest rates during the year ended december   our interest rate swaps  which were at a fixed interest rate of  resulted in additional interest expense to us during the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for compared to for the effective rate for is lower than the statutory federal rate primarily because it includes a valuation allowance for tax benefits associated with the loss on the sale of the tpd assets that may not be realizable 
the effective rate for reflects the recognition of a tax benefit from exiting the central european home canning test market 
results of operations comparison of and we reported consolidated net sales of million in  a slight decrease from sales of million in earnings before interest  taxes and minority interest were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  consumer products reported lower sales and operating earnings  and the materials based group reported increased sales and lower operating earnings 
sales of consumer products decreased million to million in from in as home canning sales volumes returned to more normal levels compared to the season  which was influenced by the year phenomenon 
within the materials based group  triangle plastics and its wholly owned subsidiary  trienda  which were acquired on april  and sold effective november   contributed million to sales compared to million for the eight month period in in  competitive pricing pressures and dramatically lower demand  chiefly in the heavy truck  manufactured housing and material handling markets  negatively impacted sales of thermoformed plastic parts 
prior year sales also included million from a plastic packaging product line  which was disposed of on may  gross margin percentages decreased from in to in gross margin decreased for consumer products due to a decline in sales of home canning products from the abnormally high levels due to year concerns of consumers accompanied by slightly higher sales of a lower margin consumer product line contributed to the decrease in the consumer products segment 
gross margin decreased for the materials based group due primarily to raw material price increases  reduced sales volumes and operating inefficiencies from several new customer programs for industrial thermoformed parts  as well as lower coinage and battery can volumes for zinc products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in expenses within the consumer products segment increased primarily due to higher depreciation expense on a new information system 
for the materials based group segment  the acquisition of triangle plastics and disposal of the plastic packaging product line contributed to the increase as triangle plastics maintained the personnel necessary to offer customers extensive design  engineering and development services  while the operations of the divested plastic packaging product line did not require this level of staffing 
the write down of fixed assets and severance costs of million associated with the realignment and consolidation of our thermoforming operations also contributed to the increase

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in commodity prices  foreign currency values  and interest rates that can affect the cost of operating  investing  and financing 
the company s exposures to these risks are low 
most of the company s zinc business is conducted on a tolling basis whereby customers supply zinc to the company for processing  or supply contracts provide for fluctuations in the price of zinc to be passed on to the customer 
the company conducts a portion of its business through its canadian subsidiary  bernardin  ltd  and as a result  is subject to the exposure that arises from foreign exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars 
such exposure arises pimarily from the translation of the results of operations of bernardin 
sales of bernardin were less than of total consolidated sales during the company from time to time invests in short term financial instruments with original maturities usually less than thirty days 
the company is exposed to short term interest rate variations with respect to the libor on its term and revolving debt obligations

changes in libor interest rates would affect the earnings of the company either positively or negatively depending on the changes in short term interest rates 
assuming that libor rates increased basis points over period end rates on the outstanding term and revolver debt  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap  would have increased by approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  short term investment rates  interest rate swap and estimated cash flow 
actual changes in rates may differ from the assumptions used in computing this exposure 
the company does not invest or trade in any derivative financial or commodity instruments  nor does it invest in any foreign financial instruments
