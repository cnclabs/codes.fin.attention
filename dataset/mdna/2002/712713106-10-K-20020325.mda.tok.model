in addition  we anticipate continuing to invest in expanded functionality across all of our software product offerings  including global product requirements and industry specific requirements 
there can be no assurance that such development efforts will result in viable products  features or functionality or that the products  features or functionality that are developed will be accepted by the market 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we regard certain aspects of our internal operations  products and documentation as proprietary  we primarily rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we also rely on contractual restrictions in our agreements with customers  employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurances that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known 
we currently hold us patents on some of the technologies included in our products and we intend to continue to file patent applications in the future 
there can be no assurance that any patents will result from such applications or that  if issued  such patents will provide any meaningful competitive advantage 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of support services are key to our success 
this success is also dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights

if our source code is accessed  the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property may increase 
furthermore  in certain foreign countries  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or the laws of the other jurisdictions do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to obtain and or maintain appropriate patent  forward looking statement copyright or trade secret protection either in the us or in certain foreign countries  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly and time consuming litigation

our facilities are suitable for their respective uses and  in general  are adequate to support the current and anticipated volume of business 
we believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations 
the following information relates to our facilities in the us in december  we entered into a five year lease for a new office facility in pleasanton  california 
this lease is structured as an operating lease with rental payments due beginning upon the completion of the construction  which occurred during the fourth quarter of the cost for the construction of the facility totaled million including interest during the construction period 
the rental payments equal the amount of interest under the agreement 
the interest rate charged on amounts funded prior to the commencement of the lease payments was libor plus as measured on the date of each funding rollover 
we began accruing interest concurrent with the lessor s first drawdown of the construction commitment in january throughout the construction period  the accrued interest amount  which was approximately million as of the end of the construction phase  was added to the construction cost 
in  we negotiated an amendment to this lease that extended the term of the lease until february  with an option to renew for an additional three years  subject to certain conditions  or purchase the building for million 
if at the end of the lease term we do not purchase the property  we would guarantee a residual value to the lessor equal to of the lessor s cost of the facility 
under this lease  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends  and are subject to various other restrictions 
as of december  we were in compliance with all covenants

the lease was structured as an operating lease with rental payments due beginning upon completion of the construction  which occurred during the first quarter of the cost for the construction of the facility totaled million including interest costs during the construction period  which were added to the balance rather than paid 
the interest rate on the obligation is a libor based floating rate  which resets on a    or month interval at our election 
the rental payments equal the amount of interest under the agreement 
we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years  subject to certain conditions  or purchase the building for million 
if at the end of the lease term we do not purchase the property  we would guarantee a residual value to the lessor equal to of the lessor s cost of the facility

we have options to terminate up to of the space at anytime following the initial four years of the lease term and the remaining at any time following the fifth year of the term  or alternatively  we may extend the term of the lease in five year increments up to years 
in september  we exercised our option to terminate of the space and will determine in if the remaining lease for will be terminated or extended 
termination fees of million are being accrued over the initial term of the agreement 
the sales price of approximately million resulted in a financial statement gain of approximately million  which is being amortized over the lease period 
we hold a right of first refusal to additional space within the site as other tenants leases expire

duffield  et al  c  and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on december  naming the company and david duffield  albert duffield  ronald codd  kenneth morris  margaret taylor  aneel bhusri  james bozzini and george still as defendants 
the consolidated complaint purported to bring claims on behalf of all purchasers of peoplesoft common stock during the period april  to january  the consolidated complaint alleged that peoplesoft misrepresented  inter alia  the degree of market acceptance of its products  the technical capabilities of its products  the success of certain acquisitions it had made  and the anticipated financial performance of the company in fiscal the consolidated complaint abandoned all of the allegations in the original complaints concerning alleged accounting improprieties  including claims of improper accounting related to the company s write downs for in process research and development in connection with various acquisitions  and improper accounting related to the company s spin off of momentum business applications  inc momentum had been a named defendant in the original actions  but was eliminated as a defendant when the consolidated complaint was filed 
forward looking statement on february   the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint  on which the court entered an order a dismissing all claims against defendants albert duffield  kenneth morris  margaret taylor  aneel bhusri  james bozzini  and george still  without leave to amend  b dismissing all claims relating to the time period prior to may   c denying the motion to dismiss as to various forward looking statements allegedly made by the company between may  and january   and d limiting the class period for which claims may be asserted to the same time period 
a first amended complaint was filed on june  the court had set a case management schedule pursuant to which the company would be required to provide discovery to plaintiffs prior to may  on february   peoplesoft agreed to a settlement of the litigation  which resulted in the dismissal of all claims against the defendants in exchange for a payment of million  all of which was funded by the company s directors and officers liability insurance 
final settlement approval was received in june  and the final payment into the settlement fund occurred during the fourth quarter of shareholder derivative litigation on june   a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the california superior court  county of alameda  entitled marble v 
duffield  et al  naming as defendants david duffield  kenneth morris  margaret taylor  albert duffield  ronald codd  cyril yansouni  aneel bhusri  george still  james bozzini and george battle 
the action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in alleged acts of insider trading when they sold stock while failing to disclose material adverse information allegedly in their possession 
the suit seeks unspecified damages  treble damages and attorneys fees 
the action was based on many of the same allegations that are the subject of the securities class action litigation pending in federal district court  including many allegations that were dismissed in the federal action 
on february   the defendants in the derivative suit agreed to a settlement  pursuant to which certain limited corporate therapeutics was offered  and in exchange for which all claims were dismissed with prejudice 
the attorney s fees for plaintiffs counsel were paid out of the million settlement fund detailed above in peoplesoft securities class action litigation in vantive securities class actions beginning on july   a series of securities class action lawsuits was filed alleging that vantive and certain current and former directors and officers violated section b of the securities exchange act and rule b promulgated thereunder 
plaintiffs filed a first consolidated amended complaint on november  the first consolidated amended complaint added to the previous complaints  among other things  allegations of accounting improprieties 
the company s motions to strike and to dismiss the first consolidated amended complaint with prejudice were granted on march  on june   plaintiffs filed an appeal from the district court s ruling in the ninth circuit court of appeal 
on march   the appellate court affirmed the district court s dismissal 
the plaintiffs have ninety days following the entry of that order to petition for review by the us supreme court 
wrongful termination litigation on november   a case was filed in the california superior court for the county of alameda yarborough v 
peoplesoft  inc  case no 
by a former employee of the company whose employment was terminated in november the complaint alleged causes of action for wrongful discharge  retaliation  age discrimination and harassment 
the company filed a cross complaint based upon plaintiff s violation of penal code section and the wrongful taking of proprietary information from the company 
the company s cross complaint was severed for separate trial  and the trial on the complaint was bifurcated on the issues of liability and damages 
on september   following a jury trial on the complaint only  the court entered judgment on a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of million 
after judgment was entered on the complaint  the cross complaint was settled 
the terms of the settlement vary according to the resolution of the matter after all appellate and further trial proceedings are exhausted or expired 
if  after all appeals and further proceedings are exhausted  a judgment remains against the company for any amount of punitive damages  the judgment is to be reduced by forty thousand dollars 
if  after all appeals and further proceedings are exhausted  no judgment remains against the company for any amount of punitive damages but a judgment remains for other damages  the judgment is to be reduced by fifteen thousand dollars  or if no judgment remains against the company  the plaintiff will pay the company fifteen thousand dollars 
peoplesoft is considering whether to appeal the judgment 
in addition to the judgment already entered  the plaintiff has filed a motion seeking million in attorney s fees 
that motion  set to be heard on march   will be vigorously opposed by peoplesoft 
other matters the company is party to various legal disputes and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of general business activities 
in the opinion of management  resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the financial position  results of the operations and cash flows of the company 
however  depending on the amount and the timing  an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect the company s future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period

in addition  our facility lease prohibits the payment of cash dividends without the lessor s consent 
b as of march   the approximate number of stockholders of record was  other information certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the stockholders 
in addition  we have  shares of authorized preferred stock 
we may issue shares of such preferred stock in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  and having such rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
under a stockholder rights plan adopted in  each share of our common stock carries the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase equity securities of peoplesoft or an acquirer 
ten days after a tender offer or acquisition of or more of our common stock  each right may be exercised for to purchase one one thousandth of one share of our series a participating preferred stock 
each one one thousandth of each share of series a participating preferred stock will generally be afforded economic rights similar to one share of common stock 
in addition after such rights are triggered  each right entitles the holder to purchase common stock with a fair value of twice the exercise price or  in certain circumstances  securities of the acquiring company for the exercise price 
each right expires in february  and  during specified periods  we may redeem or exchange each right for or one share of common stock  respectively

excluding the above items  income increased million or to million in as compared to million in and increased in from in revenues we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including consulting  training  development and maintenance  consisting of product support services and periodic updates 
revenue from license fees increased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the increase in revenues from license fees resulted primarily from increased licensing activity following the general availability of peoplesoft applications in we began shipping our first pure internet application suite  peoplesoft  in september and began shipping peoplesoft crm in june due to the global economic slowdown and uncertain recovery  we expect that license revenue growth rate for the year may be less than in 
revenue from services increased by to  million in from  million in and increased by in from  million in the increase in services revenue is primarily attributable to the growth of our installed customer base 
the increase in revenue from services in can be allocated to increases in revenue from maintenance in the amount of million  revenue from consulting in the amount of million and revenue from training of million 
the increase in revenue from services in was primarily attributable to increases in revenue from maintenance in the amount of million and consulting in the amount of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in training revenue of million 
the decrease in training revenues during is partially attributable to the decline in licensing activity during as a percentage of total revenues  revenue from services was in and and in the decrease in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues during and reflects primarily the change in revenue mix during those years resulting from the increase in revenue from license fees and the increase in revenue from development and other services 
reductions or slowdowns in our license contracting activity during a given quarter may adversely impact our future consulting  training and maintenance service revenues since these revenues typically follow license contracting activity 
our ability to maintain or increase service revenue in the future primarily depends on our ability to increase our installed customer base and resubscribe existing customers to maintenance agreements 
with the general availability of peoplesoft including peoplesoft crm which was released in june  we expect that demand from our installed base and new customers for consulting  maintenance and training services will continue to increase over the next several quarters 
revenue from development and other services decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in pursuant to the terms of the development agreement with momentum business applications  inc momentum  we perform development services on behalf of momentum  momentum pays one hundred ten percent of our fully burdened costs relating to the research and development we provide to them 
cost of development and other services decreased to in from million in and increased in from million in as of december   most of the initial development projects undertaken by momentum were completed 
forward looking statement on january   pursuant to momentum s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  we exercised our option to purchase one hundred percent of the outstanding class a common stock of momentum 
the price of the option  if exercised prior to february   is million 
refer to subsequent events under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about momentum 
the transaction is expected to close by march   subject to obtaining necessary governmental approvals 
thereafter  we do not anticipate any revenue from development services and any associated cost of development services from momentum 
revenues earned by providing development services to momentum comprised of our total revenues of billion for revenues by segment at december   we were organized by geographic areas  in two operating segments north america  which includes operations in the us and canada  and international  which includes operations in all other regions in thousands 
revenues from external customers north america international consolidated total revenues from the north america segment increased by to  million in from  million in and increased by in from  million in as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from the north america segment were in  in and in the dollar increase in the revenues from the north america segment is primarily attributable to the sales of additional peoplesoft applications to our existing installed base and revenues related to new customers sales 
total revenues from the international segment increased by to million in from million in and increased in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from the international segment were in  in and in the dollar increase in revenues from the international segment resulted primarily from increased sales attributable to increased globalization of our applications and increased focus on our international operations 
revenues from the europe middle east africa region represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in and no other international region had revenues equal to or greater than of total revenues in  or revenues attributable to the us were  million in   million in and  million in revenues originated in each individual foreign country were less than of total revenues during  and costs and expenses our products are based on a combination of internally developed technology and application products  as well as bundled third party products and technology 
cost of license fees consists principally of royalties  product warranty costs  technology access fees for certain third party software products and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of license fees increased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in the dollar increase in the cost of license fees in is primarily attributable to an increase of million in royalties resulting from increased license fee revenue and an increase of million in product and service warranty costs 
the dollar decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized software amortization expense in the amount of million  due in part to the write off of the products acquired in the intrepid and trimark acquisitions  partially offset by increased royalty expense resulting from the increase in licensing activity during the year 
as a percentage of forward looking statement revenue from license fees  cost of license fees was in  in and in cost of license fees as a percentage of license fee revenues will likely fluctuate from period to period due principally to the mix of sales of royalty bearing software products in each period and fluctuations in revenues and given certain fixed expenses such as the amortization of capitalized software 
on january   pursuant to momentum s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  we exercised our option to purchase one hundred percent of the outstanding class a common stock of momentum 
refer to subsequent events under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about momentum 
this transaction is expected to close by march   subject to obtaining necessary governmental approvals 
we anticipate that a substantial majority of the exercise price will be allocated to capitalized software  which we expect to amortize over a period of three to five years as cost of license fees 
therefore  the cost of license fees may increase during 
cost of services consists primarily of employee related costs and the related infrastructure costs incurred to provide installation and consulting services  post installation support and training 
cost of services amounted to million in  million in and million in  representing  and of services revenue in those years 
the dollar increase in cost of services during is primarily the result of an increase in the average headcount over the prior year required to support the growth in the installed customer base 
the dollar increase in cost of services during is primarily the result of increased average headcount in the services organization during the second half of in anticipation of increased demand for consulting and installation services related to the general availability of peoplesoft in the second half of we expect that demand from our installed base and new customers for installation  consulting  support and training services will continue to increase over the next several quarters 
consequently  cost of services may increase in dollar amount  and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
the increase during is primarily attributable to costs associated with the growth in the sales force and increased marketing campaigns 
the increase during is primarily due to an increase in sales commissions of million mainly resulting from the increase in licensing activity and an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million  both of which were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and other compensation costs of million  a decrease in facilities expenses of million  a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of million  and a decrease in depreciation expenses of million 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues have declined over each of the three years ended december   and due to increases in total revenues 
sales and marketing expenses may increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as we increase our sales force and marketing and advertising expenses in support of peoplesoft to improve our competitive positioning in the marketplace and to promote brand awareness and global recognition of our products 
product development expenses consist of costs related to our staff of software developers and outside consultants  and the associated infrastructure costs required to support software product development initiatives 
product development expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
product development costs capitalized were million in and million in no product development costs were capitalized in  other than product development costs acquired through business combinations or purchased from third parties 
the dollar decrease in product development expenses in is primarily attributable to fewer outside contractors being required for development initiatives 
the dollar increase in product development expenses in is primarily the result of our completion of peoplesoft  our first pure html internet offering  which includes internet technologies  such as xml  publish subscribe and business interlinks 
our current focus in application development is to extend our software offerings by delivering enhanced functionality and develop a number of new applications in our best of breed  integrated application suites human resources  financials  customer relationship management and supply chain management 
as part of this investment we anticipate investing in additional global product requirements and industry specific forward looking statement requirements 
however  we cannot give assurance that such development efforts will result in products  features or functionality or that the market will accept the software products  features or functionality developed 
on january   pursuant to momentum s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  we exercised our option to purchase one hundred percent of the outstanding class a common stock of momentum 
refer to subsequent events under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about momentum 
this transaction is expected to close by march   subject to obtaining necessary governmental approvals 
after the transaction has closed  we will no longer conduct product development on momentum s behalf 
as a result  we expect that the dollar amount invested in software product development expenses will moderately increase during 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
the dollar increase in is partially due to increases in employee compensation and benefits costs  due in part to a increase in average administrative headcount from the prior year and general and administrative infrastructure investments made during the year 
furthermore  we recorded an additional million in non product related litigation expense and an additional million in our provision for doubtful accounts during the dollar increase in is primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits costs due in part to a increase in the average administrative headcount during the year  partially offset by a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of million

as of the acquisition date  the technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and had no alternative future use and we expensed the million in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the capitalized intangible assets are being amortized based on their estimated useful lives of four years see newly issued accounting standards related to the elimination of goodwill amortization beginning in the first quarter of 
in performing this allocation  we considered  among other factors  our intentions for future use of the acquired assets and analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of skillsvillage s products

these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return on debt capital and equity  the weighted average return on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted sales 
associated risks included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe policies and estimates related to revenue recognition  capitalized software  allowance for doubtful forward looking statement accounts  product and service warranty and deferred income taxes represent our critical accounting policies and estimates 
future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition license revenue 
we recognize revenue from license contracts when a non cancelable  non contingent license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  no uncertainties exist surrounding product acceptance  fees from the agreement are fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
when we enter into a license agreement requiring that we provide significant customization of the software products  the license and consulting revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
services revenue 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and contract accounting is utilized for fixed price contracts 
revenue from training and development services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which in most instances is one year 
we recognize our revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with sop  sop and sab however  the accounting profession continues to discuss various provisions of these guidelines with the objective of providing additional guidance on their future application 
these discussions and the issuance of new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices that could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes that could affect our results of operations 
capitalized software we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  sfas 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products  but expense the costs associated with new releases  which consist of enhancements or increased functionality of existing products 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs including software acquired through acquisitions or by direct purchase of technology 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against loses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
product and service warranty we provide for estimated cost of product and service warranties based on historical activity 
if actual warranty activities differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
however adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the amount we have recorded 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved for issuance statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas  effective june   requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the pooling of interests method of accounting can no longer be used for business combinations completed after june  the provisions of sfas are similar to prior generally accepted accounting principles gaap  although sfas requires additional disclosures for transactions occurring after the effective date 
under sfas  we will continue to immediately write off in process research and development 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill for business combinations completed after june  effective january   goodwill will no longer be amortized  but is required to be assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
sfas also provides additional guidance on acquired intangibles that should be separately recognized and amortized  which may result in the recognition of additional intangible assets as compared with prior gaap 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will no longer amortize goodwill  thereby eliminating annual goodwill amortization of approximately million 
unamortized goodwill was million as of december  we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment in to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas we do not anticipate that an impairment charge  if any  arising from an assessment in will be significant 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period while the cost is depreciated over its useful life 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that a charge  if any  related to the adoption of sfas in will be significant 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas  which replaces sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
sfas also broadens disposal transactions reporting related to discontinued operations 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate a charge  if any  related to the adoption of sfas in will be significant 
in november  the fasb issued an announcement on the topic of income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred the announcement 
the announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the income statement 
we have netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the announcement is to be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods are to be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
we will adopt the announcement beginning in the first quarter of the announcement is not expected to have a significant impact on gross margin and will have no effect on net income  but will increase services revenue and cost of services 
in july  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf generally requires that consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be classified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as a reduction to revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf clarifies and modifies certain items discussed in eitf we are required to adopt these new standards no later than the quarter ending march  in accordance with the transition guidance in eitf  adoption will require the reclassification of financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes 
we believe that reclassification under eitf and eitf will not significantly affect our gross margin or net income  although reclassification will change the presentation of certain revenue and expense items contained within our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and billion in short term investments  consisting principally of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions  tax exempt money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  and municipalities 
working capital at december  was  million 
we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including the anticipated first quarter purchases of momentum and annuncio  the third quarter debt maturity  and expected purchases of property and equipment at least through the next twelve months 
cash provided by operating activities was million during and million during and cash used in operating activities was million during the increase in cash from operating activities from to is primarily due to an increase in net income  decrease in accounts receivable  decrease in income taxes receivable  increase in depreciation and amortization  decrease in the gain on sale of investments and increase in the tax benefits from exercise of stock options  partially offset by the decrease in deferred revenues and cash received from sale of accounts receivable 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to is primarily due to the million contribution to momentum business applications in partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in the gain on sale of investments 
cash used in investing activities was million during  million during and million during our principal use of cash in investing activities during resulted from net purchases of investments  principally of a short term duration  of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and acquisitions of million

our principal use of cash in investing activities during resulted from net purchases of investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and million during and cash used in financing activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by financing activities during was proceeds from the exercise of common stock options by employees and issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase program totaling million  which was partially forward looking statement offset by million in purchases of treasury stock under a million share repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors and million net repurchase of convertible subordinate debt

contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
payments due by period total year or less years after years short term convertible debt operating leases a total a under certain office leases in pleasanton  california  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends  and are subject to various other restrictions 
commercial commitments we have commercial commitments related to certain office facility leases in pleasanton  california 
we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessors equal to of the lessors cost of the facilities  which totaled million 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we have identified certain forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k with a footnote symbol 
we may also make other forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
forward looking statements give our expectations about the future and are not guarantees 
forward looking statements apply as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligations to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date 
the actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and contained elsewhere in this form k 
regional and or global changes in economic  political and market conditions could cause decreases in demand for our software and related services which could negatively affect our revenue and operating results and the market price of our stock 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
a regional and or global change in the economy and financial markets could result in the delay or canceling of customer purchases 
some of our competitors have recently announced that the current economic conditions have negatively impacted their financial results 
in addition  recent developments associated with terrorist attacks on united states interests have resulted in economic  political and other uncertainties  which could adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
if demand for our software and related services decrease  our revenues may decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected 
our inability to license software products to new customers may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results may be difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our revenues and results of operations may be difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
our expense levels  operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
if our actual revenues fall below expectations  our net income may be adversely affected 
many factors can affect our quarterly operating results  including the following a significant number of our license agreements are typically completed within the last few weeks of the quarter  our sales cycle is relatively long and can vary as a result of our expanding our product line and the complexity of a customer s overall business needs  the complexity and size of license transactions can result in protracted negotiations  the effect of economic downturns and global political conditions may result in decreased product demand  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs that may substantially reduce sales of licenses and services  customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system implementation due to changes in strategic priorities  project objectives  budgetary constraints  internal purchasing processes or company management  changes in our competitors and our own pricing policies and discount plans may affect customer purchasing patterns and decisions  and the number  timing and significance of our competitors and our own software product enhancements and new software product announcements may affect purchase decisions 
we may be required to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  which could negatively impact our financial results 
we may have to delay recognizing license or service related revenue for a significant period of time for a variety of types of transactions  including transactions that include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or contain other currently undeliverable elements  transactions where the customer demands services that include significant modifications  customizations or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance  transactions that involve extraordinary acceptance criteria or identified product related performance issues  and transactions that include contingency based payment terms or fees 
these factors and other specific requirements under gaap for software revenue recognition  require that we have very precise terms in our license agreements to allow us to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
although we have a standard form of license agreement that meets the criteria for current revenue recognition on delivered elements  we negotiate and revise these terms and conditions in some transactions 
sometimes we are unable to negotiate terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 
if accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change  our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices 
over the past several years  the american institute of certified public accountants has issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition  in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied to or interpreted for transactions not addressed by existing rules 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with sop  sop and sab however  the accounting profession continues to discuss various provisions of these guidelines with the objective of providing additional guidance on their application 
these discussions and the issuance of new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated reductions in recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices which could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in our contracting activity may result in reduced services revenues in future periods 
our ability to maintain or increase service revenue primarily depends on our ability to increase the number of our licensing agreements 
variances or slowdowns in licensing activity may impact our consulting  training and maintenance service revenues in future periods 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license additional products  renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional revenue from consulting services  renewed maintenance and licenses of other products 
the maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements or purchase additional products or services  our revenues could decrease 
increases in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 
we realize lower margins on service revenues than on license revenues 
in addition  services which we outsource to third parties generally yield lower gross margins than our service business overall 
as a result  if service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenue or if revenues from outsourced services increase as a percentage of total services revenue  our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our margins may be reduced if we need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms on our products and services to meet competitive pressures in our industry 
we compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines  including vendors of enterprise application software  manufacturing software applications  crm applications  human resource management system software and financial management systems software 
in addition  we compete with numerous small firms that offer products with new or advanced features 
some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  or exclusive intellectual property rights 
at least one competitor has a larger installed base than we do 
if competitors offer more favorable payment terms  contractual implementation terms  or product or service warranties  or offer product functionality which we do not currently provide  we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would be likely to reduce margins and may adversely affect operating results 
as our international business grows  we will become increasingly subject to currency risks and other costs and contingencies that could adversely affect our results 
we continue to invest in the expansion of our international operations 
the global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and rapidly changing economic and political conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the following factors  among others  present risks that could have an adverse impact on our business conducting business in currencies other than united states dollars subjects us to currency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  inability to hedge the currency risk in some transactions because of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our foreign exchange exposure  increased cost and development time required to adapt our products to local markets  lack of experience in a particular geographic market  legal  regulatory  social  political  labor or economic uncertainties in a specific country or region  including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  import and export license requirements  trade restrictions  war  terrorism and civil unrest  and higher operating costs due to local law or regulation 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees in a highly competitive labor market 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to attract  train  retain and effectively manage highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
if our efforts in these areas are not successful  our costs may increase  development and sales efforts may be hindered and our customer service may be degraded 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is intense competition for personnel in the software industry 
at times  we have had difficulty locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations  or with required industry specific expertise 
industry wide use of non compete or similar agreements by our competitors further decreases the pool of available sales and technical personnel 
these challenges will remain for the foreseeable future 
the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and stock price 
we believe that there are certain key employees within the organization  primarily in the senior management team  who are necessary for us to meet our objectives 
due to the competitive employment nature of the software industry  there is a risk that we will not be able to retain these key employees 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued growth 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
if we fail to compete effectively and introduce new products and service offerings  our results of operations and business financial condition will suffer 
the market for our software products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the competitive environment demands that we constantly improve our existing products and create new products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance and expand our core applications  successfully integrate third party products  enter new markets  improve our existing products and develop new ones to keep pace with technological developments  including developments related to the internet  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and maintain market acceptance 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  our results of operations and our business financial condition will be adversely affected and our stock price will decline 
our failure to drive or adapt to new and changing industry standards or third party interfaces could adversely affect sales of our products and services 
our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms 
there may be future or existing relational database platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design 
in addition  the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining software product lines will increase as more hardware platforms and operating systems achieve market acceptance within our target markets 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance of new user interfaces that we support or adapt to popular new user interfaces that we do not support  our sales and revenues may be adversely affected 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations 
if we are not able to maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments  our sales of products and service revenues could be adversely affected 
we may be required to undertake a costly redesign of our products if third party software development tools become an industry standard 
our software products include a suite of proprietary software development tools  known as peopletools  which are fundamental to the effective use of our software products 
while no industry standard exists for software development tools  several companies have focused on providing software development tools and each of them is attempting to establish its own as the accepted industry standard 
if a software product other than peopletools were to emerge as a clearly established and widely accepted industry standard  we may not be able to adapt peopletools appropriately or rapidly enough to satisfy market demand 
in addition  we could be forced to abandon or modify peopletools or to redesign our software products to accommodate the new industry standard 
this would be expensive and time consuming and may adversely affect results of operations and the financial condition of the business 
a decline in customers ability or willingness to migrate software applications to an internet architecture could adversely affect continued market acceptance and sales of peoplesoft and future internet based products 
with peoplesoft  use of a web browser as the user interface replaces the traditional desktop access through networked microsoft windows based personal computers 
dependable access to software applications via the internet or an intranet involves numerous risks  including security  availability and reliability 
there is a risk that some customers will not be willing or able to implement internet based applications 
if they do not  revenues may be reduced and operating results may be adversely affected 
as our software offerings increase in scope and complexity  detection and correction of errors may become more difficult  may increase costs  may slow the introduction of new products and may result in more costly performance and warranty claims 
our software programs  like all software programs generally  may contain a number of undetected errors despite internal and third party testing 
increased complexity of the software and more sophisticated expectations of customers may result in higher costs to correct such errors and delay the introduction of new products or enhancements in the marketplace 
product software errors could subject us to product liability  performance and or warranty claims 
although our agreements contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal  state  local or foreign laws or regulations 
if a claim against us were to be successful  we might be required to incur significant expense and pay substantial damages 
even if we were to prevail  the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our products 
if we lose access to critical third party software or technology  our costs could increase and the introduction of new products and product enhancements could be delayed  potentially hurting our competitive position 
we license numerous critical software and technology from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporate them into our own software products 
if any of the third party software vendors were to change product offerings  increase prices or terminate our licenses  we might need to seek alternative vendors and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our products 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the software provided by our existing vendors 
if the cost of licensing or maintaining these third party software products or other technology significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
in addition  interruption in functionality of our products could adversely affect future sales of licenses and services 
disruption of our relationships with third party systems integrators could adversely affect revenues and results of operations 
we build and maintain strong working relationships with businesses that we believe play an important role in the successful marketing and deployment of our software application products 
our current and potential customers often rely on third party system integrators to develop  deploy and manage applications 
we believe that our relationships with these companies enhance our marketing and sales efforts 
however  if our alliance partners are unable to recruit and adequately train a sufficient number of consulting personnel to support the successful implementation of our software products  we may lose customers 
moreover  our relationships with these companies are not exclusive  and they are free to start  or in some cases increase  the marketing of competitive business application software  or to otherwise discontinue their relationships with us or the support of our products 
in addition  integrators who generate consulting fees from customers by providing implementation services may be less likely to recommend our software if our products are more difficult or costly to install and maintain than competitors similar product offerings 
disruption of our relationships with these companies could adversely affect sales  revenues and results of operations 
we may be unable to achieve the benefits we anticipate from joint software development or marketing arrangements with our business partners 
we enter into various development or joint business arrangements to develop new software products or extensions to our existing software products 
we may distribute ourselves or jointly sell with our business partners an integrated software product and pay a royalty to the business partner based on end user license fees under these joint business arrangements 
while we intend to develop business applications that are integrated with our software products  these software products may in fact not be integrated or brought to market or the market may reject the integrated enterprise solution 
as a result  we may not achieve the revenues that we anticipated at the time we entered into the joint business arrangement 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals intended at the time of any acquisition 
from time to time  we acquire or invest in complementary companies  products or technologies  and enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
the risks we commonly encounter in such transactions include we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  we may have difficulty effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues  we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from the acquired business  we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  we may have difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected  our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  legal contingencies  and product development  among other things  and we may be required to sustain significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful 
the pending acquisition of momentum may have a negative impact on our future results of operations 
on january   we exercised our option to purchase all of the outstanding class a common stock of momentum for million in cash 
upon the closing of this acquisition  which is expected to occur by march   subject to obtaining necessary governmental approvals  momentum will become a wholly owned subsidiary of peoplesoft 
going forward  future development services revenues from momentum will be eliminated 
the elimination of future development services revenues from momentum  the potential future cost of internally funding development efforts  the future amortization expense associated with the purchased technology  and the possible future impairment of acquired assets may have a negative impact on our future financial results 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may offer only limited protection 
our products may infringe third party intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  and our software and documentation to be proprietary  and we primarily rely on a combination of contract  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary rights 
pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and  even if issued  the patents may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage 
we also rely on contractual restrictions in our agreements with customers  employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurances that these agreements will not be breached  that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known 
moreover  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary intellectual property rights as effectively as do the laws of the united states 
protecting and defending our intellectual property rights could be costly regardless of venue 
through an escrow arrangement  we have granted many of our customers a contingent future right to use our source code solely for internal maintenance services 
if our source code is accessed through the escrow  the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property may increase 
our competitors may independently develop technology that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us more aggressively in the future  especially in light of recent developments in patent law expanding the scope of patents on software 
these assertions could result in costly and time consuming litigation  including damage awards or present the need to enter into royalty arrangements which would decrease margins and may adversely affect the results of operations 
the uncertainty around the continuing introduction of the euro may affect us adversely 
peoplesoft contains european monetary union  or emu  functionality that allows for dual currency reporting and information management 
however  since the euro has only recently become a legally required currency in member nations  it is likely that not all issues related to conversion to emu have surfaced yet  and some that do emerge may not have been adequately addressed 
in addition  our products may be used with third party products that may or may not be emu compliant 
although we continue to take steps to address the impact  if any  of emu compliance for such third party products  failure of any critical technology components to operate properly under emu may adversely affect our revenues or require us to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
terrorist activity may interfere with our ability to conduct business 
terrorist attacks on united states interests similar to those of september   present a potential threat to communication systems  information technology and security  damage to buildings and their contents and injury to or death of key employees 
we continue to take steps to increase security and add protections against terrorist threats 
this may require adjustment or change of business practices which could involve significant capital expenditure and result in loss of focus and distraction of management and development and sales employees 
moreover  an actual or perceived increase in risk of travel due to further terrorist may reduce our ability to demonstrate products and meet with prospective customers  which may adversely affect our ability to close sales and meet projected forecasts 
although built to state of the art structural standards  our data center near our pleasanton headquarters could be vulnerable to attack using large explosives or sophisticated or unorthodox weapons 
significant structural damage to the data center could cause a disruption of our information systems and loss of financial data and certain customer data  which could adversely impact results of operations and business financial conditions 
our stock price has been and may remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations  published or otherwise  of the investment community  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  acquisitions of new products or significant customers by us or our competitors  developments with respect to our patents  copyrights or other proprietary rights of or our competitors  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts  rumors or dissemination of false and or misleading information  particularly through internet chat rooms  instant messaging and by other rapid dissemination means  changes in management  conditions and trends in the software industry  announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions 
in addition  fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities 
power outages in california may adversely affect us 
we have significant operations in the state of california and are dependent on a continuous power supply 
a california energy crisis could substantially disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california has implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we may be temporarily unable to continue operations at our california facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development of our products and disrupt communications with customers or other third parties on whom we rely  such as system integrators 
future interruptions could damage our reputation and could result in lost revenue  either of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  if energy prices were to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase which could have a negative effect on operating results 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of peoplesoft or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the stockholders 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred shares rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill and giving our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
the above factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of peoplesoft  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of peoplesoft s common stock

financial risk management foreign exchange risk our revenue originating outside the united states was  and of total revenues in  and international revenues generated from the europe middle east africa region were in and in revenues from all other geographic regions were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency as well 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from intercompany transactions in which the cost of software  including certain development costs  incurred in the united states is charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall expected profitability 
we have a foreign exchange hedging program designed to mitigate the potential for future adverse impacts on intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the program uses forward exchange contracts as the vehicle for hedging significant intercompany balances 
we use two foreign exchange banks for substantially all of these contracts 
in general  these forward foreign exchange contracts have terms of three months or less 
gains and losses on the settled contracts are included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and are recognized in the current period  consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying transaction is recognized 
to the extent these contracts do not completely hedge the intercompany balances  the net impact is recognized in other income  net 
the foreign currency hedging program is managed in accordance with a corporate policy approved by our board of directors 
at december   we had the following outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange foreign currency for us dollars notional weighted functional currency notional amount average exchange rate euros million hong kong dollars million japanese yen million singapore dollars million canadian dollars million million we had the following outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange us dollars for foreign currency notional weighted functional currency notional amount average exchange rate british pounds million south african rand million swedish krona million euros million new zealand dollars million australian dollars million swiss francs million chilean pesos million million at december   each of these contracts matured within days and had a book value that approximates fair value 
neither the cost nor the fair value of these forward foreign exchange contracts was material at december  we recorded net losses from settled contracts and underlying foreign currency exposures of approximately million in  million in and million in in addition to hedging existing transaction exposures  our foreign exchange management policy allows for the hedging of anticipated transactions  and exposure resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiary financial results into us dollars 
such hedges can only be undertaken to the extent that the exposures are highly certain  reasonably estimable and significant in amount 
no such hedges have occurred through december  interest rate risk investments in debt securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  tax exempt money market funds and highly liquid debt and equity securities of corporations  and municipalities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas represent operating balances that are typically invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
we classify debt and marketable equity securities based on management s intention on the date of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  all our investments were classified as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  that typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
at december   the average maturity of our investment securities was approximately three months 
all investment securities had maturities of less than eighteen months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we believe our investment securities  comprised of highly liquid debt securities of corporations  and municipalities  are similar enough to aggregate 
due to our anticipated tax rate  it is presently advantageous for us to invest largely in tax exempt securities 
the average interest rates shown below reflect a weighted average rate for both taxable and tax exempt investments 
at december   we invested heavily in tax exempt investments which reduced the weighted average interest rate 
below is a presentation of the maturity profile of our investment securities held at december  in millions  except interest rates expected maturity principal fair year more than amount value or less year available for sale securities weighted average interest rate interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on facility lease obligations 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
the swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million and mature at various dates in  consistent with the maturity dates of the facility leases 
under these agreements  we receive a variable rate based on the three month libor set on the last day of the previous quarter and pay a weighted average fixed rate of 
these swaps are considered to be hedges against changes in amount of future cash flows 
we recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss a million unrealized loss as of december  in connection with these interest rate swaps 
derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of million are estimated to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months based upon a month forward libor rate 
equity securities risk convertible subordinated notes in august  the company issued an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes  due august these notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are convertible into the company s common stock at the investor s option at any time at a conversion price equal to per share 
the company has repurchased million of convertible subordinated notes thereby leaving a balance of million as of december  based on the traded yield to maturity  the approximate fair market value of the convertible subordinated notes was million and million as of december  and
