critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our accounts receivable  net  fair value of financial instruments  goodwill  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies relate to those policies that are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
accounts receivable  net 
accounts receivable as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are net of reserves for customer allowances and doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for accounts receivable based on specific identification of customer accounts requiring allowances and the application of a predetermined percentage to the remaining accounts receivable balances 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for timing differences in recognizing certain income and expense items for financial reporting purposes 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of recognition of certain revenue items  the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we establish a tax valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realizable against future taxable income 
during we recorded a net loss of on the write off of the channelpoint investment and note receivable  including accrued interest 
for tax purposes  million of this loss will be considered a capital loss which can only be offset with net capital gains 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the capital loss will not be realized  therefore  a valuation allowance has been established for this item 
for tax purposes  we have incurred a domestic net operating loss of million during the realization of these net operating loss deferred assets is more likely than not  therefore  we have not established a valuation allowance related to these assets 
we also have foreign net operating losses related to our former ccc international operations 
we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of these foreign net operating losses because realization of these assets is not more likely than not 
goodwill 
the excess of purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets of acquired businesses is capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding years 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we perform an analysis of undiscounted future cash flows to determine whether recorded amounts are impaired 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas will be effective for the company beginning january  under sfas  goodwill will no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead will be reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we adopted sfas on january  and ceased the amortization of goodwill against earnings 
we expect the impact of the adoption of sfas to reduce amortization expense by million in the unamortized goodwill balance as of december  was million 
this goodwill originated from a acquisition that included the total loss service 
we currently generate approximately of our total revenue from total loss and related services 
in the future  net cash flows from the total loss service will be utilized in determining if the goodwill is impaired 
at january   no such impairment existed 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amount of our financial instruments approximates their estimated fair value based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instruments 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these investments and notes receivable may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include market conditions  valuations for similar companies  financial performance and a going concern risk 
during the year ended december   we determined that certain investments and notes receivable had incurred a decline in value that was considered other than temporary 
we determined that the carrying value of our investments in and related notes receivable from channelpoint and infocars may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above impairment factors 
we recorded a charge of million and million for channelpoint and infocars  respectively  which represented the remaining carrying value of these investments 
in addition  we provided allowances of million and million for the notes receivables and accrued interest from channelpoint and infocars  respectively 
commitments and contingencies 
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities and warrants and the rights offering and related transactions were approximately million and million  respectively

in connection with the issuance of the trust preferred securities by ccc trust and our related purchase of all of ccc trust s common securities  we issued an increasing rate note due in the principal amount of approximately million  due february  increasing rate note  to ccc trust 
the sole asset of ccc trust is the increasing rate note and any interest accrued thereon 
the interest payment dates on the increasing rate note correspond to the distribution dates on the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities mature simultaneously with the increasing rate note 
we unconditionally guaranteed all of the trust preferred securities to the extent of the assets of ccc trust 
the increasing rate note is subordinated to our bank debt 
cumulative distributions on the trust preferred securities accrue at a rate of i per annum  payable in cash or in kind at our option  for the first three years from february  and ii per annum  payable in cash  thereafter 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable on february  in addition  all or any portion of the outstanding trust preferred securities may be called for redemption at our option at any time on or after february  the redemption price for both the mandatory and the optional redemptions is equal to the liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities plus accrued but unpaid distributions 
cccg issued payment in kind notes for quarterly interest payments due on march  june  september  and december  on november   the indenture relating to the trust preferred securities was amended to permit us to conduct a rights offering and enter into a new bank credit facility 
in addition  the  warrants issued to capricorn investors iii  lp were amended to change the exercise price to  revised from the original exercise price of  in consideration for certain waivers and amendments that allowed us to conduct a rights offering and execute a new credit facility agreement 
credit facility on november   in conjunction with a million rights offering the rights offering  ccc entered into a new million credit facility agreement the new credit facility with two lenders from the existing credit facility 
the new credit facility replaced ccc s former credit facility 
as compared to the former credit facility  the new credit facility provides ccc with improved terms and additional flexibility 
the new credit facility contains negative covenants that  among other things  restrict ccc s ability to sell or transfer assets  make certain investments and make capital expenditures 
in addition  the new credit facility has certain covenants that require ccc to maintain specified levels of quarterly operating cash flow  debt coverage  fixed charge coverage and net worth 
ccc is also required to provide the bank group with monthly  quarterly and annual financial reporting 
the new credit facility matures on november  the new credit facility is guaranteed by ccc and is secured by a blanket first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of ccc and its subsidiaries 
all advances under the new credit facility bear interest  at ccc s election  at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable spread based on our leverage ratio or the prime rate in effect from time to time plus a variable spread based on our leverage ratio

three of our largest institutional stockholders and warrant holders  white river ventures  inc and capricorn investors ii and iii lp  agreed to purchase their pro rata share of the rights offering  as well as all of the shares not subscribed for by our other stockholders or warrant holders  up to an aggregate of million 
in consideration for this  we issued these stockholders  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the closing of the new credit facility prior to the rights offering required the utilization of an interim loan provided by white river ventures and capricorn investors ii and iii lp as part of their agreement to purchase all those shares not subscribed for by our other stockholders or warrant holders 
in consideration for this  we issued white river ventures and capricorn investors ii and iii lp  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
this interim loan was repaid upon the closing of the rights offering on december  our principal liquidity requirements consist of our operating activities  including product development  our investments in internal and customer capital equipment and funding requirements for our choiceparts investment 
we have the ability to operate with a working capital deficit  as we receive substantial payments from our customers for our services in advance of recognizing the revenues and the costs incurred to provide such services 
we invoice each customer one month in advance for the following month s pathways collision estimating software services 
as such  we typically receive cash from our customers prior to recognizing the revenue and incurring the expense for the services provided 
these amounts are reflected as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet until these amounts are earned and recognized as revenues 
in addition  management believes that cash flows from operations  our available new credit facility  the funding we received from the trust preferred securities and the rights offering will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the year ending december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to satisfy our liquidity needs in the future without engaging in financing activities beyond those described above

this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the shut down and sale of certain business segments  the amortization of deferred financing costs  impairment of notes receivable and equity investments and restructuring  lease abandonment and litigation costs for we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations

the markets in which we compete are increasingly characterized by technological change 
the introduction of competing services incorporating new technologies could render some or all of our services unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends on our ability to enhance our current services and to develop new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
as a result  we have in the past and intend to continue to commit substantial resources to product development and programming 
the development of new products may result in unanticipated expenditures and capital costs which may not be recovered in the event one or more of our products is unsuccessful 
our failure to develop and introduce new or enhanced services and products in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing technologies or customer requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to provide collision estimating services to our customers could be severely limited if our access to data is interrupted 
a substantial portion of the data utilized in our collision estimating products is derived from the motor crash estimating guide  a publication of a subsidiary of the hearst corporation 
we have a license to use the motor crash estimating guide data under an agreement with hearst which expires on june  hearst may terminate the license if any of the following events occur we fail to make payment of license fees  royalties and other charges due under the agreement  we do not comply with the material terms and conditions of the agreement  we become bankrupt or insolvent and we are unable to perform our obligations under the agreement  or upon two years notice  if hearst discontinues or abandons publication of the estimating guide 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the hearst license on economic terms that are beneficial to us or at all 
we do not believe that we have access to an alternative database that would provide comparable information 
any interruption of our access to the motor crash estimating guide data could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding our license with hearst  see item business intellectual property and licenses 
in addition  we license data used in the recycled parts database 
the provider of this data is undergoing a reorganization pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code 
to ensure continued access to recycled parts data  we are currently investigating other sources for this data

any interruption of our access to the data contained in the recycled parts database could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete effectively could be adversely impacted 
we regard the technology underlying our services and products as proprietary 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws  patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered certain of our trademarks 
our total loss calculation process is not patented  however  the underlying methodology and processes are trade secrets and are essential to our total loss business 
existing trade secrets and copyright laws afford us limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the obligations to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information will effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide meaningful protection for our confidential information  or that our trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by our competitors 
there can be no assurance that our trade secrets or proprietary information will provide competitive advantages or will not be challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
we may be required to litigate to defend against claims of infringement  to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of efforts by  us 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are involved in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
we are currently involved in several legal proceedings that may result in substantial payments by the company 
we currently are defendants in class action suits regarding our total loss service 
if we were to face a full court trial and be held liable in any of the actions or otherwise determine that it is in our best interests to settle any of them  we could incur significant legal expenses and be required to pay monetary damages or settlement payments that may have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
we have a history of operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain  which may impact our ability to continue operations 
we have an accumulated net deficit from inception of approximately million through december  additionally  we failed to generate a profit for the years  and  and have seen a persistent decrease in cash flow for the last four years 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in product acquisition and development  from servicing of debt and from general and administrative costs 
these costs have exceeded our revenues in most years  which have been derived primarily from the sale of our total loss services and pathways products 
although we increased our revenue in each of the years ended december   and  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain this growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness or other obligations or find alternative financing sources  our business may be adversely affected 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and other obligations and to fund planned expenditures depends on our ability to generate future cash flow 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds under our million new credit facility  depends on our satisfying various covenants  which require us to maintain certain levels of operating cash flow  debt coverage and net worth and limits our ability to make certain investments 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the credit facility or otherwise 
in addition  we can give no assurances as to whether we will be able to obtain additional financing from other sources 
inability to obtain financing from alternative sources may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
various state laws and regulations govern the use of our total loss service by insurance companies 
changes in those laws or regulations in a way that restricts the use of this service by insurance companies may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
