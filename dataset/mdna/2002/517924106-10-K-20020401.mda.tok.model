item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of lasersight s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and lasersight s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we have significant liquidity and captial resource issues relative to the timing of our accounts receivable collection and the successful completion of new sales compared to our ongoing payment obligations and our auditors have indicated that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
see liquidity and capital resources and risk factors and uncertainties we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue and absent further financing or significant improvement in sales  potentially result in our inability to continue operations 
all references to years are to lasersight s fiscal years ended december   and  unless otherwise indicated 
overview lasersight s net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  while the net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  the net losses are primarily attributable to the expenses generated by our refractive products segment 
lasersight is principally engaged in the manufacture and supply of microspot scanning excimer laser systems  software for custom ablation planning and programming  diagnostic products for precision measurements of the eye  keratomes  keratome blades and other related products used to perform procedures that correct common refractive vision disorders such as nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
since  we have marketed our laser systems commercially in over countries worldwide and currently have an installed base of approximately scanning laser systems outside the us  including over of our laserscan lsx laser systems 
in november  we received fda approval for commercialization of our laserscan lsx laser systems in the us  and shipments of that product in the us began in march our microshape family of keratome products includes our ultrashaper durable keratome  a control console  and our ultraedge keratome blades 
we began commercial shipments of our ultrashaper durable keratomes during the second quarter of  and anticipate that sale of ultraedge keratome blades will provide us with the opportunity to participate in the significant growth in refractive laser vision correction procedure volume by generating a recurring revenue stream 
we believe that our laserscan lsx laser system will make a more significant contribution to our future operating results as a result of the increased shipments of these laser systems to us customers after we received fda approval for treatment of myopia with astigmatism in september in addition  the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome in the fourth quarter of and the expected commercialization of our astramax diagnostic workstation during should contribute to our future operating results 
as a result of these significant developments  our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
however  we expect to continue to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow at least through the first half of we also license our scanning patent to other participants in the excimer laser industry 
for information regarding our export sales and operating revenues  operating profit loss and identifiable assets by industry segment  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales  and the percentage change in such items from the comparable prior year period 
any trends illustrated in the following table are not necessarily indicative of future results

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in during the year ended december   refractive products revenues decreased million  or  to million from million in this revenue decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
during the year ended december   excimer laser system sales accounted for approximately million in revenues compared to million in revenues in during the year ended december   laser systems were sold compared to laser systems sold in the reduction in laser sales is primarily attributable to the delayed fda approval of our laser in the us for the treatment of astigmatism and the general economic slowdown in many regions of the world 
net revenues from patent services for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  to million from million in  due to the march sale of most rights associated with the blum patent 
cost of revenues  gross profit 
for the year ended december  and  gross profit margins were and  respectively 
the gross margin decrease during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to decreased sales and lower average selling prices of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system  causing overhead to be a higher percentage of sales 
in addition  royalty revenues decreased in as a result of the sale of the blum patent in march the decreased number of laser sales resulted in lower raw material costs relating to the laserscan lsx excimer laser system of million and there was a decrease in our inventory obsolescence reserve of million from research  development and regulatory expenses 
research  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in we continued to develop our keratome systems and excimer laser systems and continued to pursue protocols in our effort to attain and expand our fda approvals for our refractive products 
as a result of the continued development of our astramax diagnostic workstation  we expect research and development expenses during to continue at approximately the same levels incurred during regulatory expenses are expected to remain constant as a result of our continued pursuit of various fda approvals  including pre market approval supplements  and the possible development of additional pre market approval supplements and future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to an increase in expenses incurred at our refractive products operations of approximately million related to enhancements to the customer support and training  sales and marketing and software development departments of million and million of legal fees related to patent issues and litigation 
the patent litigation  which accounted for a significant portion of those legal fees  was settled in may  and we have experienced a significant decrease in our legal expenses since that time 
selling related expenses 
selling related expenses consist of those items directly related to sales activities  including commissions on sales  royalty or license fees  warranty expenses  and costs of shipping and installation 
commissions and royalties  in particular  can vary significantly from sale to sale or period to period depending on the location and terms of each sale 
selling related expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales commissions resulting from lower sales and a decrease of million of warranty expense primarily related to decreased laser system sales 
selling related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue during over this increase primarily resulted from additional license fee expense for our keratome products of million due to minimum royalties under our january amended and restated license agreement  regardless of keratome sales  and a higher proportion in of international laser sales  which include a royalty based on selling price  to total sales 
see risk factors and uncertainties company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
in addition  the decrease in patent services revenue did not result in a reduction of selling related expenses  which are related to refractive products 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease was due to the impairment loss incurred on certain intangible assets at december  of approximately million  reducing future amortization expenses  and the sale of the blum patent in march that had an unamortized book value at the date of sale of approximately million 
our intangible assets include acquired technologies  patents and license agreements 
loss from operations 
the operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to the operating loss of million in this increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the decrease in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations 
other income and expenses 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from interest and dividend income was earned from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the loan and credit facility we established in march other income included a net gain  after expenses associated with the sale  of million from the sale of the blum patent in march the patent was sold for million net of related expenses and  prior to the sale  had a book value at the date of sale of approximately million 
other expenses for the year ended december  included approximately million in payments related to the settlement of patent litigation 
income taxes 
for the year ended december  and  lasersight had no income tax expense 
discontinued operations 
costs related to the discontinued operations of the health care services segment were million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase included approximately million of goodwill impairment resulting from the decision to discontinue the operations and a provision for losses during the phase out period of million 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million in the increased net loss for the year ended december  can be attributed to the decrease in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system  an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations and the discontinued health care services operations  partially offset by the gain generated by the sale of the blum patent 
loss per share 
the loss per basic and diluted share was for the year ended december  and in during the year ended december   the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock during and  the september private placement of common stock  the issuance of common stock related to our july financing and the issuance of shares related to the amended and restated license and royalty agreement related to our keratome products 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million in during the year ended december   refractive products revenues increased million  or  to million from million in this revenue increase was primarily the result of increased sales of the laserscan lsx due to our ability to sell laser systems in the us  the higher price of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and the introduction of our blade and keratome related products 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
during the year ended december   excimer laser system sales accounted for approximately million in revenues compared to million in during the years ended december  and  respectively  laserscan lsx system sales accounted for substantially all excimer laser system sales 
during the year ended december   laser systems were sold  compared to laser system sales in of the laser systems sold in  were discounted sales to existing customers compared to laser systems sold that included discounted sales to existing customers in net revenues from patent services for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million from million in  due to increased licensing fees 
cost of revenue  gross profits 
for the years ended december  and  gross profit margins were and  respectively 
the gross margin increase during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased sales of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and higher patent and health care services revenues 
these increased sales were partially offset by higher raw material costs relating to the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an increase in our inventory obsolescence reserve of million 
this additional reserve primarily relates to a write down of our aesthetic inventory  consisting mainly of erbium lasers used for skin resurfacing 
this product line is not part of our focus on refractive products 
research  development and regulatory expense 
research  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in we continued to develop our keratome systems  excimer laser systems and continued to pursue expanded fda approvals for our refractive products and added the development of new technologies like our astramax diagnostic workstation 
regulatory expenses continued as a result of our continued pursuit of fda approvals  protocols added during related to the potential use of our laser systems for treatments utilizing the lasik procedure  pre market approval supplements added during and the possible development of additional pre market approval supplements and future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to an increase in expenses incurred at our refractive products subsidiary of approximately million over these included enhancements primarily to the customer support and training  sales and marketing departments  including the establishment of a us sales department  of million  the establishment of our european operation of million  higher depreciation costs of million and million of legal fees related to patent issues and litigation 
see risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
selling related expenses 
selling related expenses consist of those items directly related to sales activities  including commissions on sales  royalty or license fees  warranty expenses  and costs of shipping and installation 
commissions and royalties  in particular  can vary significantly from sale to sale or period to period depending on the location and terms of each sale 
selling related expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales commissions resulting from increased laser system sales  an increase of million in license fees primarily resulting from the introduction of our keratome products and an increase of million of warranty expense primarily related to increased laser system sales 
during the last six months of  million of keratome related royalties resulted from minimum royalty obligations 
see risk factors and uncertainties company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets was million  approximately the same as in items directly related to the amortization of intangible assets are acquired technologies  patents and license agreements 
impairment loss 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million related to goodwill of our lasersight centers subsidiary 
the combination of increased price competition and resulting losses in many other laser centers businesses during and our increased focus on refractive product development and commercialization resulted in management s decision in late to abandon the strategy of a mobile laser business 
as a result  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of such goodwill  and concluded that a significant impairment of intangible assets had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because the carrying value of the assets could not be recovered through estimated net cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we also recorded an impairment loss of approximately million related to the pma application acquired in in december  we submitted to the fda our own pma supplement representing data from clinical trials performed on our lsx laser system  an advantage over the pma application acquired in in addition  the fda has audited and approved our manufacturing operation for the lsx laser system 
this december submission resulted in management s decision to abandon further efforts related to the pma application acquired in as a result  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of such intangible asset  and concluded that a significant impairment of it had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because the carrying value of the assets could not be recovered through estimated net cash flows 
loss from operations 
the operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to the operating loss of million in this increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the increase in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary  more than offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations as well as impairment loss of million 
other income and expense 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the comparable period in interest and dividend income was earned from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was not material 
income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  lasersight had no income tax expense as a result of net losses 
discontinued operations 
costs related to the discontinued operations of the health care services segment were million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the improvement resulted from increased revenues during net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million in the increase in net loss for the year ended december  can be attributed to the increase in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary  more than offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations as well as an impairment loss of million 
loss per share 
the loss per basic and diluted share was for the year ended december  and in during the year ended december   the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock  private placements of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants 
liquidity and capital resources we have significant liquidity and capital resource issues relative to the timing of our accounts receivable collection and the successful completion of new sales compared to our ongoing payment obligations 
we believe we will need to generate increased revenues  collect them and reduce our expenditures relative to our recent history 
while we are working to achieve these improved results  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures 
our working capital remains positive approximately million as of the end of march  though the timing of the conversion of our current assets into cash is not totally in our control 
for example  we cannot dictate the timing of the collection of our accounts receivable with our customers and converting our inventory is dependent on our ability to generate new sales of our products and collect the sales price in a timely manner 
management expects lasersight s cash and cash equivalent balances and funds from operations which are principally the result of sales and collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash requirements for only the next two to four weeks in the absence of lasersight obtaining an additional source of capital or a significant improvement in our cash flows from operations 
our expectations regarding future working capital requirements and our ability to continue operations are based on various factors and assumptions which are subject to substantial uncertainty and risks beyond our control and no assurances can be given that these expectations will prove correct 
the occurrence of adverse developments related to these risks and uncertainties or others could result in lasersight being unable to generate additional sales and collect new and outstanding accounts receivable and the incurrence of unforeseen expenses or lasersight being unable to control expected expenses and overhead 
if we fail to generate additional sales and collect new and outstanding accounts receivable or incur unforeseen expenses or fail to control our expected expenses and overhead  we will likely be unable to continue operations for the expected two to four week period in the absence of obtaining additional sources of capital 
we are actively seeking investors to invest in the range of million to million in equity and or debt  as well as distribution agreements for certain products  which would provide temporary relief from our current liquidity pressures 
however  even if we succeed in completing a financing transaction  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures in a timely manner 
additionally  if we are able to enter transactions to meet our liquidity needs  it could be on terms that seriously dilute our present stockholders or significantly restrict the flexibility of our business 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that we have the liquidity to survive long enough to achieve market acceptance with our products in the us and financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue and absent further financing or significant improvement in sales  potentially result in our inability to continue operations 
our principal sources of funds have historically been from sales of preferred stock and common stock  sales of subsidiaries and patent rights and  to a lesser extent  our operating cash flows 
we issued equity securities totaling approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in  and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants and our employee stock purchase plan of approximately  in  million in  million in   in and  in in addition  we sold subsidiaries and various patent rights  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million in  million in and million in additionally  we received million in for a paid up license to our scanning patent 
we have principally used these capital resources to fund operating losses  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and retirement of debt 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
on march   we completed the sale of us patent no 
 blum patent for a cash payment of million  net of related expenses 
we retained a non exclusive royalty free license under the patent  which relates to the use of ultraviolet light for the removal of organic tissue 
our net book value of the patent at the date of the sale was approximately million 
on march   we established a million term loan and million revolving credit facility with heller 
we borrowed million under the term loan at a rate per annum equal to two and one half percent above the prime rate 
interest is payable monthly and the loan must be repaid on march  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow amounts at a rate per annum equal to one and one quarter percent above the prime rate for short term working capital needs or such other purposes as may be approved by heller 
borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable related to us sales 
eligible accounts receivable will primarily be based on future us sales  which are expected to increase with the recent fda approval of our laser for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism 
borrowings under the loans are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the term loan and credit facility require us to meet certain covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum net worth 
the terms of the loans extend to march  in addition to the costs and fees associated with the transaction  we issued to heller a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires on march  at march   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
future availability under the revolving credit facility is dependent upon ongoing us sales of products 
in july  we completed a million private placement of series f convertible participating preferred stock 
effective february   the company s covenants on the term note payable to heller were amended to decrease the required minimum level of net worth and establish a minimum level of tangible net worth and minimum quarterly revenues during in addition  monthly principal payments of  begin in february  increasing to  monthly in june and  monthly in october our working capital decreased million from million at december  to million as of december  this decrease in working capital resulted primarily from the net loss of million offset by cash generated from the sale of a patent  the licensing of patents  the july private placement and the proceeds of the term loan  for net proceeds of million 
operating activities used net cash of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  we expect to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow from operations for the first half of there can be no assurance that we can regain or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in any subsequent fiscal period 
net cash provided by investing activities of million during the year ended december   can be attributed primarily to the sale of the blum patent 
as of december   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash provided from financing activities during the year ended december  of million can be attributed to entering into the term loan agreement and the million private placement in july  described above 
lasersight had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents available  as of april   to fund continuing operations and is currently facing significant liquidity and capital resource concerns 
management expects lasersight s cash and cash equivalent balances and funds from operations which are principally the result of sales and collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash requirements for the next two to four weeks in the absence of lasersight obtaining an additional source of capital or a significant improvement in our cash flows from operations 
this expectation is based upon assumptions regarding cash flows and results of operations over the next two to four weeks and is subject to substantial uncertainty and risks beyond our control 
if these assumptions prove incorrect  the duration of the time period during which lasersight could continue operations could be materially shorter 
the risks and uncertainties regarding management s expectations are more fully described under the heading risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue and absent further financing or significant improvement in sales  potentially result in our inability to continue operations 
there can be no assurance that sales and collection of accounts receivables will meet the level of management s expectations 
there can be no assurance o that our recent fda approval for the treatment of nearsightedness with or without astigmatism  in september  will result in increased sales and a corresponding increase in cash flows from operations  or o as to the correctness of the other assumptions underlying our business plan or our expectations regarding our working capital requirements or our ability to continue operations 
since september  we have experienced a modest increase in us sales and collection of accounts receivable as a result of our recent fda approval 
we will require additional financing to continue operations unless o our recent fda approval results in a significant increase in us sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system with a corresponding increase in cash flows from operations  and o there are no unanticipated delays in the commercial release of our astramax diagnostic workstation 
we are currently seeking opportunities for additional financing through a private placement of our common stock or debt financing and  more broadly  have retained mccoll partners llc as our financial advisor to assist us in exploring strategic options including the possible sale of lasersight or its assets 
there can be no assurance that our exploration of financing opportunities and strategic options will result in our obtaining sufficient financing  on acceptable terms  to permit our continued operations or identify any other viable option for lasersight 
additionally  to the extent we are able to obtain additional financing to address our current liquidity concerns we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing would be available or that the terms of any available financing would be acceptable 
future availability of our existing million credit facility is totally dependent upon future us sales of products 
see risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks we could require additional financing  which might not be available if we need it 
our expectations regarding future working capital requirements are based on various factors and assumptions including the successful reduction of our cost structure  anticipated cash flows from operations including our success in making sales and the collection of accounts receivable  the uncertain timing of additional supplemental fda approvals for our laserscan lsx excimer laser system which could continue to negatively impact our sales during  potential growth in laser sales after receipt of further fda approvals  increases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases when sales increase  the potential for borrowing under our revolving credit facility  the uncertain impact of the market introduction of our ultrashaper durable keratomes and astramax diagnostic workstations  commercial acceptance of our ultraedge keratome blades  the anticipated timely collection of receivables and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance and we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control and no assurances can be given that these expectations will prove correct 
similarly  our long term liquidity will be dependent on the successful entrance into the us market of our laser systems  the successful entrance into us and international markets of our diagnostic workstation and keratome products  and our ability to collect our receivables on a timely basis 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement we adopted the provisions of statement no 
on july  and the provisions of statement no 
on january  we do not expect statement no 
to have a material effect on the consolidatee financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
also supercedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
statement no 
is intended to establish one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
we adopted statement no 
on january  we do not expect statement no 
to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition  estimating product warranty reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserves and impairment of long lived assets 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue and ii royalty revenue 
the company recognizes revenue on its products upon shipment  provided that the persuasive evidence of an arrangement is in place  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of ownership have been transferred 
transfer of title and risk of ownership occurs when the product is shipped to the customer as there are no customer acceptance provisions in our sales agreements 
should management determine that customer acceptance provisions are modified for certain future transactions  revenue recognition in future reporting periods could be affected 
royalty revenue from the license of patents owned is recognized in the period earned 
product warranty reserves we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience  including the types of service parts required to repair our products  the frequency of warranty calls  and the component cost of the raw materials and overhead  as well as expectations of future conditions 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts and notes receivable balances 
we estimate losses based on the overall economic climate in the countries where are customers reside  customer credit worthiness  and an analysis of the circumstances associated with specific accounts which are past due 
our accounts and notes receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves for our estimated obsolete inventory 
the reserves are equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value could affect the evaluations 
seasonality  backlog and customer payment terms based on our historical activity  we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations have a material impact on our financial performance 
to date  we have been able to ship laser units as orders are received 
as a result  order backlog is not a meaningful factor in our business 
in the us  we expect that sales of our laser systems will generally be to customers with approved credit  and we anticipate that the purchase price for such laser systems will generally be paid to us within days of shipment 
in international markets  unless a letter of credit or other acceptable security has been obtained  we generally require a down payment or deposit from our laser system customers at or before installation 
on occasion  it is necessary to meet a competitor s more liberal terms of payment 
in those and other cases  we may provide term financing 
our internally financed sales with repayment periods exceeding months measured from the installation date were five systems in  systems during and systems in in our experience  sales of major capital equipment such as excimer laser systems in certain areas  including much of south and central america  often require payment terms ranging from to months 
risk factors and uncertainties the business  results of operations and financial condition of lasersight and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including the ones noted below financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue and absent further financing or significant improvement in sales  potentially result in our inability to continue operations 
we continue to be challenged by our significant liquidity and capital resource issues relative to the timing of our accounts receivable collection and the successful completion of new sales compared to our ongoing payment obligations 
we believe we will need to generate increased revenues  collect them and reduce our expenditures relative to our recent history 
while we are working to achieve these improved results  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures in a timely manner 
our working capital remains positive approximately million as of the end of march  though the timing of the conversion of our current assets into cash is not totally in our control 
for example  we cannot dictate the timing of the collection of our accounts receivable with our customers and converting our inventory is dependent on our ability to generate new sales with our products and collect the sales price in a timely manner 
in addition  we are actively seeking investors to invest in the range of million to million in equity and or debt  as well as distribution agreements for certain products  which would provide temporary relief from our current liquidity pressures 
however  even if we succeed in completing a financing transaction to address our current liquidity concerns  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures in a timely manner 
additionally  if we are able to enter transactions to meet our liquidity needs  it could be on terms that seriously dilute our present stockholders or significantly restrict the flexibility of our business 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that we have the liquidity to survive long enough to achieve market acceptance with our products in the us we experienced significant net losses and deficits in cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and  as set forth in the following table 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in the future 
year ended december  net loss million million million deficit in cash flow from operations million million million as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
lasersight had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents available  as of april   to fund continuing operations and is currently facing significant liquidity and capital resource concerns 
management expects lasersight s cash and cash equivalent balances and funds from operations which are principally the result of sales and collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash requirements for only the next two to four weeks in the absence of lasersight obtaining an additional source of capital or a significant improvement in our cash flows from operations 
our expectations regarding future working capital requirements and our ability to continue operations are based on various factors and assumptions including the successful reduction of our cost structure  anticipated cash flows from operations including our success in making sales and the collection of accounts receivable  the uncertain timing of additional supplemental fda approvals for our laserscan lsx excimer laser system which could continue to negatively impact our sales during  potential growth in laser sales after receipt of further fda approvals  increases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases when sales increase  the potential for borrowing under our revolving credit facility  the uncertain impact of the market introduction of our ultrashaper durable keratomes and astramax diagnostic workstations  commercial acceptance of our ultraedge keratome blades  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
these factors and assumptions are subject to substantial uncertainty and risks beyond our control and no assurances can be given that these expectations will prove correct 
these risks and uncertainties include o our ability to sell products and collect accounts receivables at or above the level of management s expectations  o the willingness of trade creditors to continue to extend credit to lasersight  o the occurrence of unforeseen expenses and our ability to control expected expenses and overhead  o reductions and cancellations in orders  o our ability to fulfill orders in light of our current financial condition  o our ability to improve pricing and terms of international sales  o our ability to introduce new refractive products that complement excimer laser systems  o the loss of  or failure to obtain additional  customers  o changes in pricing by our competitors  o our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants associated with our term loan and revolving credit facility  and o the occurrence of property and casualty losses which are uninsured or that generate insurance proceeds cannot be collected in a short time frame 
the occurrence of adverse developments related to these risks and uncertainties or others could result in lasersight being unable to generate additional sales and collect new and outstanding accounts receivable and the incurrence of unforeseen expenses or lasersight being unable to control expected expenses and overhead 
if we fail to generate additional sales and collect new and outstanding accounts receivable or incur unforeseen expenses or fail to control our expected expenses and overhead  we will likely be unable to continue operations for the expected two to four week period in the absence of obtaining additional sources of capital 
we are currently seeking additional equity and or debt financing and  more broadly  have retained mccoll partners llc as our financial advisor to assist us in exploring strategic options including the possible sale of lasersight or its assets 
there can be no assurance that our exploration of financing opportunities and strategic options will result in our obtaining sufficient financing  on acceptable terms  to permit our continued operations or identify any other viable option for lasersight 
if lasersight is unable to obtain additional sources of capital and its operating activities fail to substantially improve to a level that lasersight can continue operations  we may file  or be forced to file  bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or otherwise sell our assets to satisfy creditors 
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a sale of assets to satisfy creditors would be unlikely to result in any value to lasersight s stockholders 
if we are able to enter transactions to meet our liquidity needs  it could be on terms that seriously dilute our present stockholders or significantly restrict the flexibility of our business 
with respect to management s expectations regarding lasersight s ability to continue operations for the expected period and the risks and uncertainties relating to those expectations  readers are encouraged to review the discussions under the captions risk factors and uncertainties if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms  we require additional financing  which we might not be able to obtain  we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven  required per procedure fees payable to visx under our license agreement may exceed per procedure fees collected by us  our supply of certain critical components and systems may be interrupted because of our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  as well as the other items discussed under the heading risks factors and uncertainties and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  these risks and uncertainties can affect lasersight s ability to continue operations for the expected period in absence of obtaining additional capital resources 
if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
although we monitor the status of our receivables and maintain a reserve for estimated losses  we cannot be certain that our reserves for estimated losses  which were approximately million at december   will be sufficient to cover the amount of our actual write offs over time 
at december   our net trade accounts and notes receivable totaled approximately million  and accrued commissions  the payment of which generally depends on the collection of such net trade accounts and notes receivable  totaled approximately million 
actual write offs that exceed amounts reserved could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of any loss that we may have to recognize in connection with our inability to collect receivables is principally dependent on our customers ongoing financial condition  their ability to generate revenues from our laser systems  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against delinquent customers 
our ability to evaluate the financial condition and revenue generating ability of our prospective customers located outside of the us  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against customers located outside of the us  is generally more limited than for our customers located in the us our agreements with our international customers typically provide that the contracts are governed by florida law 
we have not determined whether or to what extent courts or administrative agencies located in foreign countries would enforce our right to collect such receivables or to recover laser systems from customers in the event of a customer s payment default 
when a customer is not paying according to established terms  we attempt to communicate and understand the underlying causes and work with the customer to resolve any issues we can control or influence 
in most cases  we have been able to resolve the customer s issues and continue to collect our receivable  either on the original schedule or under restructured terms 
if such issues are not resolved  we evaluate our legal and other alternatives based on existing facts and circumstances 
in most such cases  we have concluded that the account should be written off as uncollectible 
at december   we had extended the original payment terms of laser customer accounts totaling approximately million by periods ranging from to months 
such restructured receivables represent approximately of our gross receivables as of that date 
our liquidity and operating cash flow would be adversely affected if additional extensions become necessary in the future 
in addition  it would be more difficult to collect laser system receivables if the payment schedule extends beyond the expected or actual economic life of the system  which we estimate to be approximately five to seven years 
to date  we do not believe any payment schedule extends beyond the economic life of the applicable laser system 
we require additional financing  which we might not be able to obtain 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced deficits in cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
consequently  we do not have sufficient capital resources to continue operations beyond two to four weeks in the absence of our obtaining an additional source of capital resources  unless o our recent fda approval results in a significant increase in us sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system with a corresponding increase in cash flows from operations  and o there are no unanticipated delays in the commercial release of our astramax diagnostic workstation 
we are currently seeking additional equity and or debt financing and  more broadly  have retained mccoll partners llc as our financial advisor to assist us in exploring strategic options including the possible sale of lasersight or its assets 
there can be no assurance that our exploration of financing opportunities and strategic options will result in our obtaining sufficient financing  on acceptable terms  to permit our continued operations or identify any other viable option for lasersight 
our expectations regarding future working capital requirements are based on various factors and assumptions including the successful reduction of our cost structure  anticipated cash flows from operations including our success in making sales and the collection of accounts receivable  the uncertain timing of additional supplemental fda approvals for our laserscan lsx excimer laser system which could continue to negatively impact our sales during  potential growth in laser sales after receipt of further fda approvals  increases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases when sales increase  the potential for borrowing under our revolving credit facility  the uncertain impact of the market introduction of our ultrashaper durable keratomes and astramax diagnostic workstations  commercial acceptance of our ultraedge keratome blades  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance and we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control and no assurances can be given that these expectations will prove correct 
similarly  our long term liquidity will be dependent on the successful entrance into the us market of our laser systems  the successful entrance into us and international markets of our diagnostic workstation and keratome products  and our ability to collect our receivables on a timely basis 
on march   we established a million term loan and million revolving credit facility with heller 
we borrowed million under the term loan at a rate per annum equal to two and one half percent above the prime rate 
interest is payable monthly and the loan must be repaid on march  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow amounts at a rate per annum equal to one and one quarter percent above the prime rate for short term working capital needs or such other purposes as may be approved by heller 
borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable related to us sales 
eligible accounts receivable will totally be based on future us sales  which are expected to increase with the recent fda approval of our laser for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism 
currently  we cannot borrow under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the loans are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the term loan and credit facility require us to meet certain covenants 
effective february   the company s covenants on the term note payable to heller were amended to decrease the required minimum level of net worth to million  establish a minimum tangible net worth of million and establish minimum quarterly revenues during in addition  monthly principal payments of  began in february  increasing to  monthly in june and  monthly in october the terms of the loans extend to march  in addition to the costs and fees associated with the transaction  we issued to heller a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires on march  at march   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
additionally  to the extent we are able to obtain additional financing to address our current liquidity concerns  we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing would be available or that the terms of any available financing would be acceptable 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the terms of the new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt could require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest and may render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
if we are not able to obtain financing necessary to meet our working capital needs  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that we have the liquidity to survive long enough to achieve market acceptance with our products in the us we have significant short term liquidity issues relative to the timing of our accounts receivable collection and the successful completion of new sales compared to our ongoing payment obligations 
we believe we will need to generate increased revenues  collect them and reduce our expenditures relative to our recent history 
while we believe these improved results are possible  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures 
our working capital remains positive approximately million as of the end of march  though the timing of the conversion of our current assets into cash is not totally in our control 
for example  we cannot dictate the timing of the collection of our accounts receivable with our customers and converting our inventory is dependent on our ability to generate new sales with our products and collect the sales price in a timely manner 
in addition  we are actively seeking investors to invest in the range of million to million in equity and or debt  as well as distribution agreements for certain products  which would provide temporary relief from our current liquidity pressures 
however  even if we succeed in completing a financing transaction to address our current liquidity concerns  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate increased revenues and collections to offset required cash expenditures in a timely manner 
if we cannot maintain liquidity long enough to achieve market acceptance of our products in the us  we would not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue and absent further financing or significant improvement in sales  potentially result in our inability to continue operations 
we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven 
we received the fda approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us in late and commercial shipments to customers in the us began in march to date  our laserscan lsx laser system and per procedure fee business model have not achieved a level of market acceptance sufficient to provide our cash flows from operations to fund our business 
the anticipated level of per procedure fees payable to us by refractive surgeons resulting from our recent receipt of fda approval for treatment of nearsightedness with or without astigmatism may not be accepted by the marketplace or may exceed those charged by our competitors 
while we believe that gaining access to our scanning microspot laser technology justifies the required per procedure fee levels  we cannot assure you that this business model will be accepted by a large number of refractive surgeons 
if our competitors reduce or do not charge per procedure fees to users of their systems  we could be forced to reduce or eliminate the fees charged under this business model  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
for example  nidek co  ltd  one of our competitors  has publicly stated that it will not charge per procedure fees to users of its laser systems in the us and internationally 
see also company and business risks required per procedure fees payable to visx under our license agreement may exceed per procedure fees collected by us 
successful implementation of this business model is crucial to our success in selling our laserscan lsx laser system in the us and may require the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness of the laserscan lsx laser system and create demand by refractive surgeons 
if our laser system fails to achieve market acceptance in the us  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
keratomes are surgical devices used to create a corneal flap immediately prior to lasik laser vision correction procedures 
we began to roll out our microshape family of keratome products with the commercial launch of our ultraedge keratome blades in july and of our unishaper single use keratomes and control consoles in december in november  we commercially released our ultrashaper durable keratomes after a thorough process of engineering refinement and validity testing 
in order for our unishaper single use keratome to be commercially viable it will need to be reengineered  if possible  to include most or all of the features included in our ultrashaper keratome 
our ultrashaper durable keratome incorporates the features found in the acs keratome previously marketed by bausch lomb  inc with new enhancements and features 
however  bausch lomb has not aggressively marketed or serviced the acs since when we licensed the rights to commercially market keratomes based on the same technology  and has successfully transitioned a large number of refractive surgeons from the acs to its hansatome durable keratome product 
we believe that many refractive surgeons learned to perform the lasik procedure using the acs and prefer the surgical technique required by the acs  which is also used to operate our ultrashaper durable keratome  to the surgical technique required to operate the hansatome keratome product 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in commercially introducing or achieving broad market acceptance of our ultrashaper durable keratome or our other keratome products 
we have previously indicated that the successful implementation of our keratome product sales strategy was in part dependent upon our marketing and distribution alliance with becton dickinson 
due to the delay in the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome we initiated discussions with becton dickinson in order to modify our manufacturing and marketing agreements 
while these discussions were ongoing we received notices from becton dickinson claiming that they have the right to end our marketing arrangement and that they were not bound by the terms of our manufacturing agreement 
following our receipt of these notices  becton dickinson indicated a willingness to discuss modified terms for a marketing and manufacturing relationship 
during  we mutually agreed to terminate both agreements 
if we cannot successfully market and sell our keratome products or if we are unable to successfully replace our marketing and distribution alliance with another company  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
the vision correction industry currently consists of a few established providers with significant market shares and we may encounter difficulties competing in this highly competitive environment 
the vision correction industry is subject to intense  increasing competition  and we do not know if we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
many of our competitors have established products  distribution capabilities and customer service networks in the us marketplace  are substantially larger and have greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than we do 
visx  the historical industry leader for excimer laser system sales in the us  sold laser systems that performed a significant majority of the laser vision correction procedures performed in the us in  and similarly  bausch lomb sold a significant majority of the keratomes used by refractive surgeons in the us in  and in  alcon acquired summit autonomous inc the merger resulted in a combined entity with enhanced market presence  technology base and distribution capabilities and provided alcon with a narrow beam laser technology platform that will compete more directly with our precision beam scanning microspot laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition  the combined entity will be able to sell narrow beam laser systems under a royalty free license to certain visx patents without incurring the expense and uncertainty associated with intellectual property litigation with visx 
we anticipate that alcon will leverage the sale of its laser systems with its other ophthalmic products 
many of our competitors received earlier regulatory approvals than us and may have a competitive advantage over us due to the subsequent expansion of their regulatory approvals and their substantial experience in the us market 
we received the fda approval necessary for the commercial sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us in november and commercial shipments to customers in the us began in march our direct competitors include large corporations such as visx and alcon  each of whom received fda approval of excimer laser systems more than three years prior to our approval and has substantial experience manufacturing  marketing and servicing laser systems in the us in addition to visx and alcon  nidek and bausch lomb have also received fda approval for their laser systems 
in the us  a manufacturer of excimer laser vision correction systems gains a competitive advantage by having its systems approved by the fda for a wider range of treatments 
initial fda approvals of excimer laser vision correction systems historically have been limited to the treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness  with additional approvals for other and broader treatments granted only as a result of subsequent fda applications and clinical trials 
our laserscan lsx is currently approved for the lasik treatment of nearsightedness with and without astigmatism for a range of treatment of refractive errors up to diopters manifest refraction spherical equivalent mrse with or without a refractive astigmatism up to diopters and the prk treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness up to diopters without astigmatism 
additionally  we have received fda approval to operate our laser systems at a hz pulse repetition rate  twice the originally approved rate 
we have submitted pma supplements to the fda to permit our laser systems sold to customers in the us to utilize lasik to treat hyperopia  hyperopic astigmatism and mixed astigmatism 
fda approval of these applications is anticipated in  though we cannot ensure if or when the approval will be received 
our ability to sell our laser systems in the us may be severely impaired if the fda does not give timely approval to these supplements 
currently  excimer laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx  alcon  bausch lomb and nidek have been approved for higher levels of nearsightedness than the laserscan lsx 
alcon s apex plus and ladarvision excimer laser workstations  visx s star s excimer laser system and nidek s ec excimer laser system have received fda approval for the lasik treatment of nearsightedness with or without astigmatism 
the approvals for many of the systems are for the correction of nearsightedness in the range of diopters to diopters and nearsightedness with astigmatism generally in the range of diopters to diopters 
bausch lomb s technolas excimer laser has also received fda approval for the treatment of nearsightedness from diopter up to diopters with up to diopters of astigmatism 
the visx and alcon excimer laser systems are also approved for the treatment of moderate farsightedness 
in september  the fda approved alcon s ladarvision system for the correction using lasik of farsightedness of up to diopters and an astigmatism range of up to diopters 
in october  the fda approved visx s star s and s systems for the correction using prk of farsightedness of up to diopters and an astigmatism range of up to diopters 
in february  the fda approval of visx s custom contoured ablation pattern method for treatment of decentered ablations under a humanitarian device exemption hde 
an hde authorizes the use and marketing of a device that is intended to benefit patients in the treatment of conditions that affect fewer than  individuals 
competitors earlier receipt of lasik and hyperopia specific fda regulatory approvals could give them a significant competitive advantage that could impede our ability to successfully sell our laserscan lsx system in the us our failure to successfully market our product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our principal competitors in the keratome business  including current market leader bausch lomb  received fda clearance prior to the commercialization of our keratome products and have substantial experience marketing their keratome products 
the established market presence in the us of previously approved laser systems and keratome products  as well as the entry of new competitors into the market upon receipt of new or expanded regulatory approvals  could impede our ability to successfully introduce our laserscan lsx system in the us and our keratome products worldwide and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we believe that our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships will have a significant impact on our ability to meet our business objectives 
these strategic relationships are critical to our future success because we believe that these relationships will help us to o extend the reach of our products to a larger number of refractive surgeons  o develop and deploy new products  o further enhance the lasersight brand  and o generate additional revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in our industry if they have relationships with our competitors  or if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  some potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships are in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance as to the terms  timing or consummation of any future strategic relationships 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 
because the sale of our products is dependent on the continued market acceptance of laser based refractive eye surgery using the lasik procedure  the lack of broad market acceptance would hurt our business 
we believe that whether we achieve profitability and growth will depend  in part  upon the continued acceptance of laser vision correction using the lasik procedure in the us and other countries 
we cannot be certain that laser vision correction will continue to be accepted by either the refractive surgeons or the public at large as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
the acceptance of laser vision correction and  specifically  the lasik procedure may be adversely affected by o possible concerns relating to safety and efficacy  including the predictability  stability and quality of results  o the public s general resistance to surgery  o the effectiveness and lower cost of alternative methods of correcting refractive vision disorders  o the lack of long term follow up data  o the possibility of unknown side effects  o the lack of third party reimbursement for the procedures  o the cost of the procedure  and o unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from the use of laser vision correction 
unfavorable side effects and potential complications that may result from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by any manufacturer may broadly affect market acceptance of laser based vision correction surgery 
potential patients may not distinguish between our precision beam scanning spot technology and the laser technology incorporated by our competitors in their laser systems  and customers may not differentiate laser systems and procedures that have not received fda approval from fda approved systems and procedures 
any adverse consequences resulting from procedures performed with a competitor s systems or an unapproved laser system could adversely affect consumer acceptance of laser vision correction in general 
in addition  because laser vision correction is an elective procedure that is not typically covered by insurance and that involves more significant immediate expense than eyeglasses or contact lenses  adverse changes in the us or international economy may cause consumers to reassess their spending choices and to select lower cost alternatives for their vision correction needs 
any such shift in spending patterns could reduce the volume of lasik procedures performed that would  in turn  reduce the number of laser systems sold and our revenues from per procedure fees and sales of single use products such as our ultraedge keratome blades 
the failure of laser vision correction to achieve continued market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
even if laser vision correction achieves and sustains market acceptance  sales of our keratome products could be adversely impacted if a laser procedure that does not require the creation of a corneal flap were to emerge as the procedure of choice 
new products or technologies could erode demand for our products or make them obsolete  and our business could be harmed if we cannot keep pace with advances in technology 
in addition to competing with eyeglasses and contact lenses  excimer laser vision correction competes or may compete with newer technologies such as intraocular lenses  intracorneal inlays  corneal rings and surgical techniques using different or more advanced types of lasers 
two products that may become competitive within the near term are implantable contact lenses  which are pending fda approval  and corneal rings  which have been approved by the fda 
both of these products require procedures with lens implants  and their ultimate market acceptance is unknown at this time 
to the extent that any of these or other new technologies are perceived to be clinically superior or economically more attractive than currently marketed excimer laser vision correction procedures or techniques  they could erode demand for our excimer laser and keratome products  cause a reduction in selling prices of such products or render such products obsolete 
in addition  if one or more competing technologies achieves broader market acceptance or renders laser vision correction procedures obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as is typical in the case of new and rapidly evolving industries  the demand and market for recently introduced products and technologies is uncertain  and we cannot be certain that our laserscan lsx laser system  ultrashaper durable keratome  ultraedge keratome blades  unishaper single use keratome or future new products and enhancements will be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  announcements or the anticipation of announcements of new products  whether for sale in the near future or at some later date  may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
company and business risks we will be required to significantly expand our us manufacturing operations to meet our business plan and must comply with stringent regulation of our manufacturing operations 
we manufacture our laserscan lsx laser systems for sale in the us at our manufacturing facility in winter park  florida  and continue to manufacture our laser systems for sale in international markets at our manufacturing facility in costa rica 
our us personnel have limited experience manufacturing laser systems 
we cannot  therefore  assure you that we will not encounter difficulties in increasing our production capacity for our laser systems at our florida facility  including problems involving production delays  quality control or assurance  component supply and lack of qualified personnel 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experience with the use of the product 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda  certain state agencies and international regulatory agencies 
we require that our key suppliers comply with recognized standards as well as our own quality standards  and we regularly test the components and sub assemblies supplied to us 
any failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including the fda s quality systems good manufacturing practice qsr gmp regulations  could cause production and distribution of our products to be delayed or prohibited  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
required per procedure fees payable to visx under our license agreement may exceed per procedure fees collected by us 
in addition to the risk that our refractive lasers will not be accepted in the marketplace  we are required to pay visx a royalty for each procedure performed in the us using our refractive lasers 
the required per procedure fees we are required to pay to visx may exceed the per procedure fees we are able to charge and or collect from refractive surgeons  which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
we are required to make certain minimum payments to the licensor under our keratome license agreement that was amended and restated on january  this amendment replaced a january  amendment in its entirety 
under the terms of the amendment we issued  shares of common stock to the licensors  valued at approximately million  in partial payment for royalties during the term of the license 
the term of the license was extended three years until july  in addition  remaining minimum royalty payments totaling approximately million as of march  will be due in monthly installments averaging approximately  per month through august or quarterly installments averaging approximately  per quarter from october through october through the term of the amendment 
as a result of our obligations under this license arrangement  the minimum royalty payments we are required to make to the licensors may exceed our gross profits from sales of our unishaper and ultrashaper keratome products 
the amendment eliminated a restriction on us manufacturing  marketing and selling other keratomes  but the sale of other keratomes will be included in the gross profit to be shared with the licensors 
the licensor s share of the gross profit  as defined in the amendment  decreased from to 
our failure to timely obtain or expand regulatory approvals for our products and to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 
our excimer laser systems  diagnostic and custom ablation products and keratome products are subject to strict governmental regulations that materially affect our ability to manufacture and market these products and directly impact our overall business prospects 
fda regulations impose design and performance standards  labeling and reporting requirements  and submission conditions in advance of marketing for all medical laser products in the us new product introductions  expanded treatment types and levels for approved products  and significant design or manufacturing modifications require a premarket clearance or approval by the fda prior to commercialization in the us the fda approval process  which is lengthy and uncertain  requires supporting clinical studies and substantial commitments of financial and management resources 
failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and clearances in the us and other countries  or significant delays in obtaining these approvals and clearances  could prevent us from marketing our products for either approved or expanded indications or treatments  which could substantially decrease our future revenues 
additionally  product and procedure labeling and all forms of promotional activities are subject to examination by the fda  and current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing by manufacturers of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with these requirements may result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  suspension of manufacturing  denial or withdrawal of pmas  and criminal prosecution 
laser products marketed in foreign countries are often subject to local laws governing health product development processes  which may impose additional costs for overseas product development 
future legislative or administrative requirements  in the us or elsewhere  may adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain regulatory approval for our products 
the failure to obtain approvals for new or additional uses on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may be adversely affected 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including our precision beam scanning microspot technology laser systems 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation or other legal proceedings in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity 
these legal proceedings may consume considerable resources  including management time and attention  which would be diverted from the operation of our business  and the outcome of any such legal proceeding is inherently uncertain 
we are aware that certain competitors are developing products that may potentially infringe patents owned or licensed exclusively by us 
in order to protect our rights in these patents  we may find it necessary to assert and pursue infringement claims against such third parties 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources litigating such infringement claims and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in resolving such claims or that the resolution of any such dispute will be on terms that are favorable to us 
see patent infringement allegations may impair our ability to manufacture and market our products 
patent infringement allegations may impair our ability to manufacture and market our products 
there are a number of us and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery that we do not own or have the right to use 
if we were found to infringe a patent in a particular market  we and our customers may be enjoined from manufacturing  marketing  selling and using the infringing product in the market and may be liable for damages for any past infringement of such rights 
in order to continue using such rights  we would be required to obtain a license  which may require us to make royalty  per procedure or other fee payments 
we cannot be certain if we or our customers will be successful in securing licenses  or that if we obtain licenses  such licenses will be available on acceptable terms 
alternatively  we might be required to redesign the infringing aspects of these products 
any redesign efforts that we undertake could be expensive and might require regulatory review 
furthermore  the redesign efforts could delay the reintroduction of these products into certain markets  or may be so significant as to be impractical 
if redesign efforts were impractical  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling the infringing products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation involving patents is common in our industry 
while we do not believe our laser systems or keratome products infringe any valid and enforceable patents that we do not own or have a license to  we cannot assure you that one or more of our other competitors or other persons will not assert that our products infringe their intellectual property  or that we will not in the future be deemed to infringe one or more patents owned by them or some other party 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to market one or more of our products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international sales 
our international sales accounted for and of our total revenues during the year ended december  and december   respectively 
in the future  we expect that sales to international accounts will represent a lower percentage of our total sales as a result of our recent additional regulatory approval for our laserscan lsx laser system in the us and the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome in november see industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
international sales of our products may be limited or disrupted by o the imposition of government controls  o export license requirements  o economic or political instability  o trade restrictions  o difficulties in obtaining or maintaining export licenses  o changes in tariffs  and o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
our sales have historically been and are expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars 
the european economic union s conversion to a common currency  the euro  is not expected to have a material impact on our business 
however  due to our significant export sales  we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the effective price in local currencies of our products 
this could result in reduced sales  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting receivables relating to our international sales 
our supply of certain critical components and systems may be interrupted because of our reliance on a limited number of suppliers 
we currently purchase certain components used in the production  operation and maintenance of our laser systems and keratome products from a limited number of suppliers  and certain key components are provided by a single vendor 
for example  all of our keratome blades have historically been manufactured exclusively by becton dickinson  though we are currently in discussions with a replacement manufacturer  and the majority of our ultrashaper components are manufactured exclusively by owens industries pursuant to our agreement with them 
we do not have long term contracts with providers of some key laser system components  including tui lasertechnik und laserintegration gmbh  which currently is a single source supplier for the laser heads used in our laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
currently  sensomotoric instruments gmbh  teltow  germany  is a single source supplier for the eye tracker boards used in the laserscan lsx 
any interruption in the supply of critical laser or keratome components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of our key suppliers ceases providing us with products of acceptable quality and quantity at a competitive price and in a timely fashion  we would have to locate and contract with a substitute supplier and  in some cases  such substitute supplier would need to be qualified by the fda 
if substitute suppliers cannot be located and qualified in a timely manner or could not provide required products on commercially reasonable terms  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unlawful tampering of our system configurations could result in reduced revenues and additional expenses 
we include a procedure counting mechanism on laserscan lsx lasers manufactured for sale and use in the us users of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system could tamper with the software or hardware configuration of the system so as to alter or eliminate the procedure counting mechanism that facilitates the collection of per procedure fees 
unauthorized tampering with our procedure counting mechanism by users could result in us being required to pay per procedure fees to visx that we were not able to collect from users 
if we are unable to prevent such tampering  our license agreement with visx could be terminated after all applicable notice and cure periods have expired 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key employees  especially michael r 
farris  our president and chief executive officer 
a loss of one or more such officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any officer or key employee 
as we commercially launch our laser system and keratome products in the us  we will need to continue to implement and expand our operational  sales and marketing  financial and management resources and controls 
while to date we have not experienced problems recruiting or retaining the personnel necessary to expand our business  we cannot assure you that we will not have such problems in the future 
our recent layoff may have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals for necessary positions  and if we are unable to effectively manage growth in our domestic or international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inadequacy or unavailability of insurance may expose us to substantial product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks and possible adverse publicity that are inherent in the development  testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices for human use 
these risks increase with respect to our products that receive regulatory approval for commercialization 
we have agreed in the past  and we will likely agree in the future  to indemnify certain medical institutions and personnel who conduct and participate in our clinical studies 
while we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that any such liability will be covered by our insurance or that damages will not exceed the limits of our coverage 
even if a claim is covered by insurance  the costs of defending a product liability  malpractice  negligence or other action  and the assessment of damages in excess of insurance coverage in the event of a successful product liability claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  product liability insurance may not continue to be available  either at existing or increased levels of coverage  on commercially reasonable terms 
common stock risks variations in our sales and operating results may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  historically a significant portion of our laser system orders for a particular quarter have been received and shipped near the end of the quarter 
as a result  our operating results for any quarter often depend on the timing of the receipt of orders and the subsequent shipment of our laser systems 
other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include o timing of regulatory approvals and the introduction or delays in shipment of new products  o reductions  cancellations or fulfillment of major orders  o the addition or loss of significant customers  o the relative mix of our business  o changes in pricing by us or our competitors  o costs related to expansion of our business  and o increased competition 
as a result of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in some quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above or other uncertainties 
the market price of our common stock may continue to experience extreme fluctuations due to market conditions that are unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market  and in particular the securities of technology companies like us  could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  developments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of refractive vision correction procedures  and changes in reports and recommendations of securities analysts  have and may continue to have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the significant number of shares eligible for future sale and dilutive stock issuances may adversely affect our stock price 
sales  or the possibility of sales  of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
substantially all of our  shares of common stock outstanding at march  were freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of  except to the extent such shares are held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule under the securities act or subject only to the satisfaction of a prospectus delivery requirement 
shares of common stock that we may issue in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings or pursuant to outstanding warrants or agreements could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause significant dilution in our earnings per share and net book value per share 
we may be required to issue more than  additional shares of common stock upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock  the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options  and the satisfaction of certain contingent contractual obligations 
see possible dilutive issuances of common stock 
the anti dilution provisions of certain of our existing securities and obligations require us to issue additional shares if we issue shares of common stock below specified price levels 
if a future share issuance triggers these adjustments  the beneficiaries of such provisions effectively receive some protection from declines in the market price of our common stock  while our other stockholders incur additional dilution of their ownership interest 
we may include similar anti dilution provisions in securities issued in connection with future financings 
anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and stockholder rights plan may make an acquisition of lasersight more difficult and could prevent you from receiving a premium over the market price of our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors  discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay  defer or prevent a change in control of us  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the economic interests of our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder action  and our by laws require advance notice of director nominations or other proposals by stockholders 
we also are subject to provisions of delaware corporation law that prohibit a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or more of the corporation s common stock an interested stockholder for three years after the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights agreement  or poison pill  and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire or more of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
acquisition risks past and possible future acquisitions that are not successfully integrated with our existing operations may adversely affect our business 
we have made several significant acquisitions since  and we may in the future selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances with companies whose business or technology complement our business 
we may not be able to identify suitable candidates to acquire or enter into joint ventures or other arrangements with entities  and we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms for such activities 
in addition  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel  technology and operations of any acquired companies  which could prevent us from realizing expected synergies  and may incur unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
this could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other resources 
amortization and charges relating to our significant intangible assets could adversely affect our stock price and reported net income or loss 
of our total assets at december   approximately million  or  were intangible assets 
any reduction in net income or increase in net loss resulting from the amortization of intangible assets resulting from future acquisitions by us may have an adverse impact upon the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the event of a sale of lasersight or our assets  we cannot be certain that the value of such intangible assets would be recovered 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  including a history of operating or cash flow losses  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting pronouncements 
other risks the risks described above are not the only risks facing lasersight 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we have deemed immaterial which could also negatively impact our business operations 
if any of the foregoing risks actually occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates is not significant 
the company s investments are limited to highly liquid instruments with maturities generally three months or less 
at december   the company had approximately million of short term investments classified as cash and equivalents 
all of the company s transactions with international customers and suppliers are denominated in us dollars
