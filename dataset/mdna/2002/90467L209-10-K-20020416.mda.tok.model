item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operation and financial condition deteriorated dramatically in for the reasons explained in this annual report on form k 
in significant ways  the company s declining financial condition impacted its ability to compete for contracts and labor  two important ingredients in the company s historic profitability 
oil and gas prices have declined recently and drilling activity has significantly declined in the company s primary market  the gulf of mexico 
the company does not expect recovery of fabrication prices or substantial increases in fabrication projects in the near future 
the company must experience a marked improvement in  or its ability to remain a going concern will be in question 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on i the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  offshore west africa  south and central america and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
in addition  improvements in three dimensional seismic  directional drilling  production techniques and other advances in technology have increased drilling success rates and reduced costs 
although we believe our operations depend these indicators  the correlation of those measures with our revenue is not direct as to timing and level 
during the year ended december   transition and the fiscal year ended march    and  respectively  of the company s revenue was derived from projects fabricated for installation in international areas  with the remainder designed for installation in the gulf of mexico 
the company believes that its strong presence in both overseas markets and the gulf of mexico market historically enabled it to remain competitive and obtain fabrication work worldwide 
most of the company s revenue and expenses are recognized on a percentage of completion basis determined by the ratio that labor  labor and subcontracting costs  or total contract costs incurred bear to the total estimated labor  labor and subcontracting costs or total contract costs required for completion 
accordingly  expected labor and subcontracting costs and other contract costs are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized on the basis of direct labor hours worked at fixed hourly rates and the cost of materials or subcontract costs incurred plus mark up 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and year ended december  unaudited during the year ended december   the company s revenue was million  a increase from the million revenue in the year ended december  this increase was mainly caused by increases in manhours worked at the company s deep water facility in lake charles  which revenue increased to million in the year ended december  in addition  pricing in the structural fabrication business improved slightly in compared to the prior year 
volume in the company s international project management business was million  an increase of over the prior year 
these increases were offset in part by approximately reductions in the domestic process systems and barge repair revenue to million in the year ended december  direct labor hours worked in all facilities was approximately the same in the year ended december  as in the year ended december  cost of revenue was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor costs and raw materials and indirect costs that can be specifically allocated to projects such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs 
the decrease in cost as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december   was mainly due to improved margins in structural fabrication offset in part by costs in excess of revenue at the company s deep water facility in lake charles  where the company incurred cost overruns on two jack up repair projects which were the first substantial projects at the facility 
the company also recorded contract loss reserves of million on a first of a kind liftboat being constructed in the company s barge repair facility in new iberia 
sg a costs were lower in the year ended december  compared to the same period in both in gross dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease reflects the shut down of the company s barge repair facility in new iberia  which had been underutilized  overall consolidation of support functions and staff reductions in both new iberia and lake charles  mainly in the december quarter of in addition  last year was negatively impacted by the write off of a  receivable from a customer who filed for bankruptcy under chapter in the december quarter  we collected million on a receivable that had been written off in the september quarter 
depreciation and amortization in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december  depreciation increased to million in the year ended december  due mainly to the commencement of operations at the lake charles facility 
this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of the write off in september of substantially all of the company s recorded goodwill 
other expense in the year ended december  included the recording of million impairment charge on goodwill  million loss on the disposal of equipment and the shut down of the company s barge repair facility in new iberia  and the recording of  of commitment fees associated with the waiver and amendment to the company s secured credit agreement  which was executed april  these monthly fees were incurred as a result of the company being out of compliance with the terms of the waiver and amendment 
interest expense increased in the year ended december  to million from million in the same period last year 
the increase is the result of the company being out of compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  which resulted in increased interest margins being paid on amounts outstanding under the agreement 
income tax expense of million was recognized in the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the september quarter to establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fas  the company considered that it had a cumulative pre tax loss for recent years and revised its judgment about the realization of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance reflects the company s judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets at december  are realizable 
comparison of the nine months ended december  and nine months ended december  unaudited effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end to december of each year 
the period from april  to december  represents a transition period of nine months which is referred to as the nine months ended december  the presentation below compares the operating results for the nine months ended december  to the nine months ended december   which period was unaudited 
in our opinion  all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the statement of operations have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements for these periods 
during the nine months ended december   the company s revenue was million  an increase from the million generated in the nine months ended december  this increase was primarily caused by an increase in manhours worked offset in part by comparatively lower pricing levels experienced in the current period caused by a general reduction in demand for the company s structural fabrication services  and  process equipment design and fabrication services  both in the gulf of mexico and internationally 
structural fabrication  rig refurbishment and plant maintenance revenue increased approximately from million to million 
this was offset in part by a decrease of in process equipment design and fabrication revenue from million to million 
international project management revenue increased from million to million 
total direct labor hours worked increased from the levels experienced in the prior period particularly during the quarter ended september  this activity has not resulted in higher prices 
we estimate that lower prices in the nine month period ended december  resulted in the revenue per man hour for that period being approximately lower than the revenue per man hour in the nine month period ended december  cost of revenue was million in the nine months ended december  compared to million in the nine months ended december  cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor costs and raw materials and indirect costs that can be specifically allocated to projects such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs 
the increase in costs compared to revenues reflects reduced margins for all services from the same period last year caused by the decreased demand noted above and the increased competition for the projects being awarded 
in addition  cost of labor has increased by approximately in the nine month period ended december  compared to the same period last year 
our cost of sales for the nine months ended december  included million in loss reserves on two fixed price fabrication contracts 
these contracts have been completed and loaded out 
additionally  we recognized million in contract costs on a new build liftboat 
in part  these costs were overruns from development costs on this first of a kind liftboat 
we believe there will be strong market demand for this type of vessel 
in part the cost overruns relate to start up costs at our obi yard  which had reduced its skilled worker and supervisor teams to critically low levels due to the lack of demand back in december  which is when the liftboat contract was awarded 
we completed this liftboat in january all three of these contracts were awarded in december and january  when there were few projects being awarded and when pricing was poor 
we recorded approximately  cost in excess of revenue on a drilling rig project brought into our lake charles facility 
these costs were incurred to get this semi submersible drilling rig into the facility and introduce the facility 
we completed final negotiations and wrote off a  disputed billing on a contract which had been completed in june the nine month period ended december  was also negatively impacted by poor weather conditions  in particular in the month of december 
cold  foggy and wet weather reduced the productivity in our fabrication facilities 
in fact  there was only one day in the entire month of december that the weather was appropriate to allow painting of fabricated structures 
this delayed and added to the cost of all projects in the yards  including the ones referred to above 
our sg a remained approximately of revenue for the nine month period ended december  sg a includes a  write off of a receivable from a company which filed chapter in october additionally  we started unifab environmental  which designs and manufactures waste treatment facilities  and realized start up costs for that operation in this time period 
depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended december  were million compared to million for the same period last year 
interest expense increased in the nine months ended december  to million from 
million in the same period last year 
this increase is the result in increased interest rates over the period and an increase in the average outstanding amount borrowed under our credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources historically the company has funded its business activities through funds generated from operations  short term borrowings on its revolving credit facilities for working capital needs and individual financing arrangements for equipment  facilities improvements  insurance premiums  and long term needs 
during the year ended december   the company s available funds and million generated from financing activities together funded cash used in operations and investing activities of million 
investing activities consisted mainly of capital expenditures of million  including completion of the company s deep water fabrication and drilling rig refurbishing facility in lake charles  louisiana 
capital expenditures included costs of expansion and improvements to the company s fabrication facility in new iberia  purchases of modern  labor saving equipment and heavy machinery 
the company has also required capital expenditures for equipment to update telecommunication and data processing capabilities 
amended and restated credit agreement 
on march   the company entered into a waiver and second amendment to amended and restated credit agreement the amendment 
the senior secured credit agreement was originally entered into on november   and was amended and restated october  with the same syndicate of commercial banks led by bank one  louisiana  na  as agent the credit agreement 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the credit agreement  of which million is for letters of credit 
during  the company increased the outstanding balance under the credit agreement from million to million 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and provides borrowings subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on of the appraised value of fixed assets approximately million at december  plus of eligible accounts receivable approximately million at december  
at december   borrowings under the credit agreement exceeded the borrowing base limit by million 
the credit agreement requires the company to make monthly interest payments  currently approximately  per month 
throughout  the company was out of compliance with the financial covenants and certain other requirements of the credit agreement and as a result paid interest at a rate that included a maximum variable interest margin 
the variable fee range for issued letters of credit is to per annum on the principal amount of letters of credit issued for performance or payment  or to per annum on the principal amount if the letter of credit is a financial letter of credit 
the unused commitment fee range is to per annum 
the letter of credit fees and unused commitment fees are variable based on the funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was not in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december   as follows tangible net worth was not sufficient to meet the ratio to funded indebtedness required by one of the financial covenants  adjusted earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were not sufficient to meet the ratio to funded indebtedness  adjusted earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  were not sufficient to meet the ratio to fixed charges  the current ratio was not sufficient to meet the minimum current ratio  and the net loss before taxes for the quarter ended december  did not meet the required minimum net income 
at the request of the company  the bank group executed the amendment on march   which waived the defaults of these financial covenants for the period ended december  under the terms of the amendment  all new advances as well as all existing advances bear interest at the prime lending rate plus at march  
the maturity of the credit agreement has been extended to january  if the company has not replaced the credit agreement by january   or if the maturity date is accelerated due to non performance under the terms of the amendment  the company will be required to pay  to the bank group 
the amendment requires the company to make scheduled reductions totaling million  million of which was paid concurrent with the execution of the amendment on march   and the remaining million is due on june  in the event the company is unable to make the million payment by june   the company will be required to pay up to  to the bank group 
the amendment allows the company to exceed the borrowing base limit up to million until june   and limits the company to the borrowing base limit beginning june  the amendment requires the company to diligently market for sale the company s deep water facility in lake charles  louisiana 
the amendment revises the financial covenants related to operating results to be consistent with the company s expected operating results 
however  because the amendment requires substantial repayments by june   and the company currently does not have the resources to make such payments  there is a substantial risk that the company will be unable to maintain compliance with its obligations to its bank group 
the amendment provides for additional borrowings under certain conditions  mainly through the sale of assets or subsidiaries 
the company hopes to replace the credit agreement with debt or equity financing before the maturity date of january  in the normal course of business  the management evaluates the company s capital structure and is considering alternatives to the current credit facility structure 
we would seek to replace the current commercial bank financing arrangement with financing that is longer term in nature  including asset financing  subordinated debt and equity capital 
a new credit agreement or financing arrangement may require higher interest and principal repayments  requiring the company to use more of its cash flow from operations to meet these obligations 
a new credit agreement or financing arrangement could further restrict company operations by  for example  limiting the ability of the company to make acquisitions and acquire assets 
an alternative debt or equity arrangement would likely involve the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities that are convertible into shares of company common stock 
as a result of any such conversion  existing shareholders could lose the control of the company that they now enjoy 
any of these new financing arrangements could reduce the market value of company shares 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires the recording of all acquired intangible assets that arise either from contractual or legal rights  or that are separable from the acquired entity 
the company adopted this accounting standard effective july   as required and it had no impact on the company s financial position 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
is effective january  and changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of this statement 
goodwill was reduced in by million of which million was recognized on the impairment of recorded goodwill 
goodwill remaining on the balance sheet after the impairment write down is not significant and adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets 
these liabilities are required to be recorded at their fair values which are likely to be the present values of the estimated future cash flows in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
requires the associated asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation will be accreted each year through a charge to expense 
the amounts added to the carrying amounts of the assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
the company is required to implement sfas no 
on january   and we have not determined the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  promulgates standards for measuring and recording impairments of long lived assets 
additionally  this standard establishes requirements for classifying an asset as held for sale  and changes existing accounting and reporting standards for discontinued operations 
the company is required to implement sfas no 
on january   and does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue from construction contracts  which are typically of short duration  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating actual labor cost  labor and subcontract cost  or total estimated contract costs for work performed to date to the estimated total labor cost  total labor and subcontract cost or total contract cost of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and repairs 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
the company s customers are principally major and large independent oil and gas companies and drilling companies 
these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are evaluated periodically against specific accounts that are known to be uncollectible 
increases in the reserves for uncollectible accounts are charged to operating results in the period they are identified 
receivables are generally not collateralized 
significant adverse changes in the economic environment of the oil and gas industry could result in materially lower collectibility of recorded receivables and could require charge for uncollectible accounts in the future 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over their remaining lives 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  the likelihood of future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment 
based on this assessment  the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are more likely than not unrealizable 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if taxable income is not available to allow for the deduction of the deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest or currency risks 
interest on approximately million  substantially all of the company s notes payable  was variable  based on short term interest rates 
a general increase of short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of  per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
the company has a subsidiary located in the united kingdom for which the functional currency is the british pound 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
historically  fluctuations in british pound us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound may positively or negatively impact earnings  however  due to the size of its operations in the united kingdom  the company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations to be material in while the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments  it may use them in the future if deemed appropriate
