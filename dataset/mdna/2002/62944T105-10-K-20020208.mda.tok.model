mortgage banking segment the mortgage banking segment had operating income  excluding the amortization of excess reorganization value and goodwill  of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total loan closings were   and  for the same respective years 
the improvement in operating income over both comparative periods was primarily due to nvr s operational restructuring of the mortgage segment announced in the first quarter of  and to a lesser extent  to a more favorable pricing environment 
the operational restructuring specifically entailed the closure of all of the mortgage segment s retail operations to focus solely on serving nvr s homebuilding operations builder business 
the mortgage segment s builder business historically has produced higher operating margins than its other lines of mortgage business 
the restructuring has resulted in the mortgage segment capturing an increased percentage of the loans and title work associated with the growing homebuilding segment s customer base 
as noted above  the homebuilding segment s settlements increased to  in from  in and  in also  as part of its restructuring  the mortgage segment substantially reduced staffing and related general and administrative costs 
as a result of the restructuring activities described above  nvr recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of  in the first quarter of the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the second quarter of a detail of the costs comprising the total charge incurred in the first quarter of is as follows write off of first republic goodwill  noncancelable office and equipment leases  asset impairments  severance total  during and  approximately and  respectively  in severance and lease costs were applied against the restructuring reserve 
approximately of the restructuring accrual established at march   remains at december   and primarily relates to accrued lease costs 
seasonality the results of nvr s homebuilding operations generally reflect the seasonality of the housing market in the middle atlantic region of the united states 
nvr historically has entered into more sales contracts in this region during the first and second quarters 
because nvr s mortgage banking operations have changed their strategic focus to exclusively serve nvr s homebuilding customers  to the extent that homebuilding is affected by seasonality  mortgage banking operations will also be affected 
effective tax rate nvr s consolidated effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the reduction of the effective tax rate over the three year period is primarily due to higher taxable income relative to nvr s permanent differences  primarily the amortization of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and non deductible compensation 
in january  nvr amended one of its long term cash incentive plans  requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr 
the effect of this amendment  estimated to produce approximately an  deferred tax benefit for compensation expensed prior to december   will reduce nvr s effective tax rate below current levels as a result of converting these compensation related permanent tax differences to temporary differences as of the amendment date

 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets excess reorganization value from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
management will be performing the impairment test as defined in sfas no 
during the first quarter of  but does not expect that nvr will incur an impairment loss relative to its existing excess reorganization value and goodwill upon adoption of sfas no

nvr expects that it will  from time to time  repurchase additional shares of its common stock  pursuant to repurchase authorizations by the board of directors and subject to the restrictions contained within nvr s debt agreements 
nvr currently contemplates that it may seek to further amend the indenture governing the notes to reduce restrictions on nvr s ability to repurchase shares of its common stock 
in january  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of  of nvr s capital stock in one or more open market and or privately negotiated transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
nvr s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
nvr s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are generally sold through optional and mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvr also sells predominantly all of its mortgage servicing rights in bulk sales at predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk associated with these interest sensitive assets 
nvr s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires may  and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr  at i the base rate of interest announced by the working capital credit facility agent or ii above the eurodollar rate 
the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was for there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december  the following table represents the contractual balances of nvr s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets  nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
