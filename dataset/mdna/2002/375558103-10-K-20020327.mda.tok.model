item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gilead was incorporated in delaware on june  we are an independent biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of antivirals  antibacterials and antifungals to treat life threatening infectious diseases 
we are a multinational company  with revenues from five approved products and marketing operations in ten countries 
currently  we market viread tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of hiv infection  ambisome amphotericin b liposome for injection  an antifungal agent  daunoxome daunorubicin citrate liposome injection  a drug approved for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma  and vistide cidofovir injection for the treatment of cytomegalovirus cmv retinitis 
hoffmann la roche inc markets tamiflu oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza  under a collaborative agreement with gilead 
we are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our clinical development programs  internal discovery programs and an active product acquisition and in licensing strategy 
our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets  target screening and medicinal chemistry 
in addition  we are currently developing products to treat hepatitis b virus and bacterial infections 
we also have expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology that we use to develop drugs that are safer  easier for patients to tolerate and more effective 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi pharmaceuticals  inc in a transaction valued at up to million in cash and osi stock 
this transaction will allow us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
on february  and on march   gilead completed two for one stock splits  effected in the form of a stock dividend  to stockholders of record as of february  and february   respectively 
accordingly  all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect both of these splits 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and  collectively referred to as sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  also resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
on july   gilead entered into a business combination with nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc nexstar 
the business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and the historical consolidated financial statements of gilead for all periods prior to the business combination have been restated to include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of nexstar 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
gilead s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as under the caption business  including risk factors in part i 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information currently available to gilead  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
ambisome sales 
we rely on sales of ambisome for a significant portion of our operating income 
there are lower priced products that compete with ambisome  a product that was recently approved that competes with ambisome  a product that the fda has deemed approvable  and products being developed that could compete with ambisome in the future 
if these other products achieve further market acceptance  or if the products in development become commercially available  revenues from sales of ambisome would likely decrease  resulting in a reduction of operating income 
viread sales 
in the future  we also expect to rely on sales of viread for a portion of our operating income 
a number of drugs to treat hiv infection and aids are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development  including products currently sold in the us among the companies that are significant competitors in the hiv aids market are glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb  hoffmann la roche  pfizer  merck  boehringer ingelheim and abbott laboratories 
given the broad range of competitors and depth of their resources  it is too early to determine if viread will achieve significant market penetration  particularly for use in treatment na ve patients given that the data supporting viread s us approval is in a treatment experienced patient population 
market acceptance of products 
the ability of our products to achieve and sustain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors  including the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals  the availability of public and private insurance and reimbursement for our products  the safety  efficacy  tolerability and cost of our products  and how our products compare to competitive products 
if our products do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  our results of operations will suffer 
tamiflu is in a new class of drugs that represent a new approach to treating and preventing the flu 
in order for tamiflu to achieve market acceptance  our marketing partner  roche  must change attitudes toward the treatment and prevention of influenza 
regulatory process 
the us food and drug administration and foreign agencies could reject or limit the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons including if they disagree with the results or designs of our clinical trials  if they believe our products have unacceptable efficacy  toxicity or tolerability  or if they believe our products cannot be safely and efficiently manufactured on a commercial basis 
if these agencies reject or limit the commercialization of our products  our financial results would be adversely affected 
the clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products are extremely expensive  and it is difficult for us to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter 
in addition  regulatory agencies could require us to conduct additional unanticipated clinical trials on our products  the cost of which could be substantial 
medicaid and other governmental reimbursement and discount programs 
our business may be adversely affected by an increase in pricing pressures  both in the us and abroad 
these pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups  judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to medicare  medicaid and health care reform  pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general 
the us has enacted legislation that requires us to pay a set rebate or offer a discount for our products that are reimbursed by medicaid  purchased as outpatient medicines by certain public health service entities and certain hospitals  or sold to certain other federal purchasers including the veterans administration 
in recent years  new legislation has been proposed in the us at the federal and state levels that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
these proposals have included prescription drug benefit proposals for medicare beneficiaries introduced in congress 
although there has been no us federal reform legislation  some states have enacted health care reform legislation 
further federal and state developments are possible 
although we cannot predict the exact nature of legislative health care reforms  the results of our operations would be adversely affected if national or state governments require us to sell our marketed products at lower prices 
compulsory licensing and generic competition 
in a number of developing countries  government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for hiv infection available at a low cost 
in some cases  governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so  their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition 
some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for hiv drugs in certain developing countries 
if certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents  sales of viread in those countries could be reduced by generic competition 
alternatively  governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of viread in those countries  thereby reducing our viread sales  or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for viread 
in either case  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
collaborations 
we depend on collaborations for the development and commercialization of certain products and for revenue  including the collaboration with fujisawa for sales of ambisome in the united states and canada  the collaboration with roche for sales of tamiflu worldwide  and the collaboration with cubist for the clinical development of cidecin 
these collaborations could fail for a number of reasons  including if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to the development  commercialization or marketing of our products  or if disputes arise with our partners 
we will also seek additional collaborations 
if our collaborations fail or if we are unable to establish additional collaborations  our financial results would be adversely affected 
foreign currency fluctuations 
a significant majority of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
we did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
we do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which minimizes but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
uncertain financial results 
we expect that our financial results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
the fluctuations can be caused by many factors that are beyond our control  including the risk factors listed above 
we have never been profitable on a full year operating basis and we may never achieve or sustain operating profitability 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates gilead s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  accrued clinical and preclinical expenses  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
gilead believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products  medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment 
expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from months for viread up to months for ambisome in the us if conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer customer incentives 
each action could result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory based on quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches 
we generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
management accrues costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates that to of the work is for upfront costs with the remaining activity generally on a straight line basis over the life of the individual contract or study 
this estimate may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations revenues we had total revenue of million for the year  million for the year and million for the year included in total revenue are net product sales  royalty income and contract revenue  including revenue from research and development r d collaborations 
net product sales revenue was million for  compared with million for and million for our revenues have been primarily derived from sales of ambisome  which represented of total product sales in  of total product sales in and of total product sales in reported sales of ambisome were million in  an increase of over ambisome sales of million in excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in  sales of ambisome in would have increased 
a significant majority of gilead s product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
we did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
we do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
sales of ambisome were million in excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in  sales of ambisome in would have increased versus reported sales 
with the expected increase in competition  we would expect ambisome sales for to remain relatively flat versus reported levels 
this assumes foreign currency exchange rates remain at consistent levels throughout when compared to in  we also recognized million in viread sales  representing of total product sales 
sales of daunoxome and vistide were million and million  respectively  in in  gilead recognized product sales revenue of million from sales of daunoxome and million from sales of vistide 
in  daunoxome sales were million and vistide sales were million 
we expect viread sales to increase in and become a greater percentage of total revenues although we cannot predict with any certainty what our actual viread sales will be in we recorded royalty revenue of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of ambisome in the united states by fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with gilead 
during the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing royalty revenues from fujisawa s sales of ambisome in the month following that in which the related product sales occur 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recognized this royalty revenue in the month the sales occurred 
royalty revenue from fujisawa was million in  compared with million in and million in the amount represents royalties from months of fujisawa sales of ambisome 
we also recorded royalty revenue of million in and million in related to sales of tamiflu 
tamiflu is an orally administered compound developed to treat and prevent viral influenza in humans 
gilead co developed tamiflu with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
and hoffmann la roche inc collectively  roche 
roche owns the worldwide commercial rights to tamiflu  and is required to pay gilead a royalty on net sales of the product 
in october  the fda approved tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults  and roche began selling the product commercially 
we record royalty revenue from roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the related tamiflu sales occur 
accordingly  gilead began recognizing royalties from tamiflu in the first quarter of the significant declines in royalty revenue can be attributed to the significantly lower incidence of flu for the season and the resulting product returns to roche 
we expect tamiflu royalties to increase somewhat in as a result of broader market penetration 
during the second half of  tamiflu was approved in the us for the prevention in adults and as a treatment for influenza in children  and approved in japan as a treatment for influenza in adults 
as of february  roche has filed for european regulatory approval of tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults 
it is unclear when and if this approval will be granted 
substantially all of the remaining net royalty revenue recognized in  and represents royalties from sales of vistide by pharmacia sa pharmacia outside the united states 
in future periods  royalties from sales of vistide are expected to be relatively flat or decline slightly 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
among other things  sab describes the sec staff s position on the recognition of certain nonrefundable up front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements 
we previously recognized nonrefundable technology access fees received in connection with collaboration agreements as revenue when received or when collectibility was probable  and when the technology had been transferred 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for these fees to recognize them as the related manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or on a straight line basis over the term of the related research and development collaboration  manufacturing or supply arrangement  as appropriate  as this method best matches the effort provided 
we believe the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was recorded in the fourth quarter of  retroactively effective as of january   as deferred revenue that will be recognized as contract revenue over the remaining term of the research and development  manufacturing or supply arrangements  as appropriate 
for the year ended december   the impact of the cumulative change in accounting principle was to increase the net loss by million 
we recognized additional contract revenue of million in and million in  in accordance with sab  related to up front fees which had been received in prior years 
the million recognized in was related to two collaborative relationships million related to an initial licensing fee from sumitomo and million related to an initial license fee from pharmacia 
the million recognized in was related to three collaborative arrangements million from sumitomo  million from pharmacia  and million related to an initial licensing fee from roche 
the remaining million of sab related deferred revenue at december  results from the sumitomo and pharmacia collaborations  and is expected to be recognized as contract revenue over the next eleven years 
there is no remaining deferred revenue related to the roche initial license fee as of december  total contract revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in the primary source of contract revenue in was from our licensing of the selex process patent estate to archemix 
this provided million of contract revenue in other sources of contract revenue in include a million milestone payment from roche relating to the development of tamiflu under an r d collaboration agreement between gilead and roche and million recognized for work associated with marketing agreements 
the single most significant source of contract revenue in and was milestone payments from roche under the r d collaboration agreement 
we recorded contract revenue from roche of million in and million in the million of contract revenue from roche in included million in milestone payments related to roche completing regulatory filings and approvals for tamiflu in the us and japan  million of r d expense reimbursements  and million resulting from the adoption of sab as discussed above 
the amount included million of milestone payments and million of r d reimbursements 
r d reimbursements from roche in decreased compared to  and reimbursements in similarly decreased relative to  as tamiflu development efforts ramped down while roche s commercialization activities increased 
as of december   gilead is entitled to additional milestone payments of up to million upon roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones 
while we may earn milestone payments under the roche agreement in  we expect expense reimbursements under the roche agreement to be minimal in such reimbursements  if any  will approximate our actual related costs incurred 
in october  we entered into an agreement with archemix corporation relating to our selex technology 
under this agreement  we gave archemix the exclusive rights to the selex process  including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements 
archemix paid to us million in and is required to pay us million in as required by our license agreement with the university technology corporation  we paid of the million payment to  and will pay of the million payment to  the university technology corporation 
we also received a warrant to purchase  shares of archemix common stock  the value of which is not material 
as required by our license agreement with the university technology corporation  we transferred of this warrant to the university technology corporation 
in march  we entered into an agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc relating to gilead s proprietary aptamer eye  formerly known as nx currently in early clinical trials  eye is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  eyetech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of eye  and  if the product is successfully commercialized  eyetech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product 
eyetech also will be responsible for all research and development costs 
we provided clinical supplies of the product to eyetech through march we received a million up front licensing fee from eyetech in april  which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period 
accordingly  million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in  and the remainder recognized as revenue in the first quarter of we are also entitled to additional cash payments from eyetech of up to million if and when eyetech reaches certain eye development milestones 
additionally  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share  the price at which the stock was issued to other investors 
in november  gilead and somalogic  inc entered into an agreement under which gilead assigned to somalogic a sole and exclusive license to certain intellectual property  including patents and patent applications 
under the terms of the agreement  somalogic was required to pay gilead a total of million in two nonrefundable installments 
the second installment totaled million and was received in november and recorded as contract revenue upon receipt 
the first installment of million was received and recognized as contract revenue in november cost and expenses cost of goods sold was million in  compared with million in and million in as a percentage of net product sales  cost of goods sold was in  in and in in connection with most of our european product sales  we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold payment currencies 
a significant majority of our manufacturing cost is in us dollars 
a decline in the value of the payment currencies relative to the us dollar will negatively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues  which are reported in us dollars  will decline 
in and  the gross margin was negatively impacted by these factors  as discussed in the product sales section under the caption revenues above 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates on reported sales revenue  cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales would have been approximately in  consistent with levels 
our cost of sales percentage on an annual basis has been in the to range in recent years 
except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in payment currencies relative to the us dollar  we expect the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales in to remain materially consistent with the rate 
in future years  changes in the nature or mix of our product sales  such as the recent commercial launch of viread for hiv infection  could impact this relationship 
in and  research and development r d expenses exceeded of our total costs and expenses 
in  r d expenses represented approximately of our total costs and expenses 
the major components of r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  clinical studies performed by contract research organizations  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase i  ii  and iii clinical trials as well as expanded access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
during  we spent approximately million on research  million on clinical development and million on pharmaceutical development activities 
this compares to spending in of approximately million on research  million on clinical development and million on pharmaceutical development activities 
spending in consisted of million on research  million on clinical development and million on pharmaceutical development activities 
in total  r d expenses for were million  compared with million for and million for the million increase in spending in versus was attributable in part to the recognition of million of a million up front payment and million of clinical milestone payments to cubist under the european licensing agreement for cidecin 
in addition  our expenses associated with the phase iii clinical trials and expanded access programs for viread for hiv infection and the phase iii clinical programs for adefovir dipivoxil for hbv infection increased approximately million and million  respectively  during the year 
based on current budgeted programs  we expect r d expenses in to be approximately million to million  or to lower than  reflecting the sale of our oncology assets to osi in december and the decreasing levels of activity associated with the us and european expanded access programs for viread 
as a result of this expected decrease  r d spending as a percentage of our total costs and expenses is expected to be below 
r d spending levels for also increased over levels 
major development projects in included viread and adefovir dipivoxil for hbv infection 
we incurred increased costs for both of these programs which were in phase iii clinical trials 
additionally  we made up front payments in the fourth quarter of to in license two oncology products from glaxo smith kline and southern research institute  the rights to both of which have been subsequently assigned to osi as part of the sale of our oncology assets in december these increases more than offset significantly lower expenses in for the development of adefovir dipivoxil for hiv infection  a program we discontinued in the fourth quarter of additionally  in  we reduced the r d workforce in boulder by employees upon completing the merger with nexstar 
recent industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical product generally takes to years an average of years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the us these averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally  although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an initial drug application or ind which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii  and iii  and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have products in development that are in phase iii studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
an estimation of completion dates and r d expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development products  see the risk factors section of item i above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in expenses in versus is primarily due to gilead s increased global marketing efforts and the expansion of our sales force to support the commercial launch of viread for hiv infection 
in  we expect sg a expenses to be approximately million to million  or to higher than levels  primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the launch of viread in the us and european union  but also our preparation for the commercial launch of adefovir dipivoxil for hbv infection 
the major factor contributing to the decrease in sg a expenses from levels was the inclusion of million of merger related expenses in these merger related expenses primarily consisted of transaction costs  including professional fees  filing fees and printing costs  employee severance costs  and the write down of certain nexstar property and equipment that was not expected to be used in future operations 
total employee severance costs of million relate to the termination of employees  the majority of which were from our boulder  colorado facility 
excluding merger expenses  sg a expenses in were essentially flat compared with higher general and administrative g a expenses in were offset by savings in sales and marketing expenses 
the increased g a spending in included costs to implement new and upgraded information technology systems and legal costs incurred in connection with new collaboration agreements and various corporate projects 
sales and marketing expenses in reflect cost savings in the us from the elimination in the second half of of duplicate positions and functions within the combined gilead and nexstar organization 
sales and marketing expenses in included costs to expand our sales and marketing capacity in anticipation of the then planned commercial launch of adefovir dipivoxil for hiv infection  which was discontinued in the fourth quarter of litigation settlement and related expenses we incurred litigation settlement and related expenses of million in  million in and million in we reached a settlement with elan corporation  plc elan  the successor company to the liposome company in which both companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings involving ambisome  gilead s liposomal formulation of amphotericin b 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we made an initial payment to elan of million and are required to make additional payments through  based on ambisome sales 
the payments are subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts 
a million accounting charge was recorded in representing the net present value of all future minimum payments we are required to make 
we record an expense each quarter based on the difference between all future minimum payments and the amount previously accrued 
these amounts have not been significant 
we do not expect the difference between the future minimum and maximum payments to elan to be material 
gain on sale of oncology assets in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets  pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property  as well as our boulder  colorado operations  including clinical research and drug development personnel  infrastructure and facilities  to osi 
the pipeline of clinical candidates includes nx liposomal lurtotecan  gs a nucleoside analogue and gs l a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor 
on the closing date  we received million in cash and osi common stock valued at approximately million 
the company recorded a non operating gain of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of this transaction 
in addition  we recorded income taxes of million in connection with this transaction 
gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate in august  we also sold our percent interest in proligo llc proligo to degussa corporation for million in cash 
proligo was a joint venture between gilead and skw americas  inc focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides 
skw americas  a subsidiary of degussa corporation  held the remaining percent of proligo 
the proceeds  net of gilead s investment in proligo  are reflected as an million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate 
interest income and interest expense we recorded interest income of million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in over was due to higher average balances of invested funds 
in december  we received approximately million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes  net of debt issuance costs 
the increase in over was due to higher interest rates on our investment portfolio 
we expect interest income in to be materially consistent with levels due to the receipt of million in cash from the sale of our oncology assets in december  offset by lower interest rates on our portfolio of fixed income securities 
we incurred interest expense of million in  compared with million in and million in the significant increase in over is due to the full year of interest on our million convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense for consisted primarily of interest on the million convertible notes  which were converted to common stock in august the decrease in from levels occurred primarily because of the august debt conversion 
interest expense for included a full year of interest on the million convertible notes 
we expect interest expense in to remain consistent with expense levels as we again incur a full year of expense on the million convertible subordinated notes 
income taxes our provision for income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in all periods  we recorded income tax expense associated with income from our foreign subsidiaries 
the significant increase in income tax expense in resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to osi  for which we recorded approximately million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate  proligo  prior to the date of the sale of our percent interest 
in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of proligo 
this represented our percent share of proligo s loss for the thirteen month period ended december  during the fourth quarter of  proligo changed its fiscal year end to december from november for  we recorded million equity in the loss of proligo for its fiscal year ended november  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the year ended december   gilead adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december   up from million at december  the increase of million was primarily due to the million cash and million in osi common stock received as part of the sale of our oncology assets to osi in december other major sources and uses of cash included proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of million and proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in proligo  offset by capital expenditures of million and cash used to fund our operating activities 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the growth was primarily due to the year over year increase in net product sales for ambisome and also the initial sales of viread in the us in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  spain  portugal and italy  our accounts receivable balances are significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  spain  portugal and italy totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
at december   past due receivables for these countries were million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
to date  we have experienced only modest losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that all past due accounts receivable  including those due from customers in these four countries  are collectible 
we continually seek to improve our collection processes to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely 
significant changes in working capital during included an million increase in inventory 
in addition  accounts payable increased million as a result of an increase in our raw material purchases and the increased use of contract manufacturers 
substantially all of this growth in inventory and accounts payable is in support of the recent us and european launch of viread 
other changes in working capital include an increase in accrued liabilities of million 
accrued clinical and preclinical expenses increased by million  primarily due to the advanced and accelerated phase iii clinical trials for adefovir dipivoxil for hbv infection 
accrued compensation has also increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to the expansion of our sales force in support of the viread launch 
other accrued liabilities increased million in  consisting principally of transaction costs and income taxes payable arising from the sale of our oncology assets to osi 
other noncurrent assets decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was due to the sale of our percent interest in proligo 
our investment in proligo at december  was approximately million and approximately million as of the date of the sale 
the decrease was partially offset by increases resulting from the million unrecognized portion of the million license fee payment to cubist and the million valuation of a warrant to purchase stock in eyetech recognized in accordance with sfas the million balance resulting from the cubist payment is included in other noncurrent assets at december  because if  prior to january  gilead terminated its rights under the agreement with respect to a preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin being developed by cubist  or if cubist discontinued development of that oral formulation  gilead would have been entitled to receive a refund of this amount from cubist 
we made capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth  as well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
of the million spent in  approximately to was research and development related 
we expect our capital spending for to decrease somewhat compared with levels  however the percentage allocated for research and development should remain consistent with the previous year 
in august  we redeemed our convertible subordinated debentures at a cash price of  per  principal amount of debentures outstanding  plus accrued interest  which was the redemption price provided for in the original debenture indenture 
upon redemption  the entire million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into  newly issued shares of gilead common stock by august  deferred debt issuance costs of million related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock 
on december   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than our common stock price at the notes issuance date 
the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after december   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets  and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes 
through april  we maintained a million unsecured line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate with a major financial institution 
under the terms of the line of credit  we were required to maintain certain financial ratios and there were limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or to engage in certain significant transactions 
the line of credit  which included a foreign exchange facility  expired in april we renewed the foreign exchange facility through april  but did not renew the line of credit 
there are no required financial ratios or limitations on debt or other transactions under the foreign exchange facility 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we are also not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for employee loans 
we have contractual obligations in the form of a litigation settlement  capital and operating leases  notes payable and clinical research organization contracts 
we believe that our existing capital resources  which includes all fixed income and equity securities  supplemented by net product sales and contract and royalty revenues  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the commercial performance of ambisome  viread and any of our products in development that receive marketing approval  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our products under development  administrative expenses  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  our possible geographic expansion  and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure you that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  sfas further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of sfas are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  as we have not accounted for any business combinations under the purchase method of accounting  the adoption of sfas on july  did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations and the adoption of sfas on january  will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas retains the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement  but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the interim periods within 
the adoption of sfas on january  will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
market risk disclosures foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states as well as sales activities in europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception 
one hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of  with a notional amount of million and an insignificant fair value at december   has a maturity of months 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value december  australian dollar  british pound  danish krone euro  norwegian krone swiss franc a significant majority of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
we did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on maturity  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return
