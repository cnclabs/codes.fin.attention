item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our historical financial statements and should be read together with our historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to consumer demand and acceptance of services offered by us  our ability to achieve and maintain acceptable cost levels  fare levels and actions by competitors  regulatory matters  general economic conditions  commodity prices and changing business strategies 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expressed or implied expectations  including  but not limited to our performance in futu re periods  our ability to generate working capital from operations  our ability to take delivery of and to finance aircraft  the adequacy of our insurance coverage and the results of litigation or investigations 
our forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipates  expects  intends  believes  will or the negative thereof  or variations thereon or comparable terminology 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
year in review in  we achieved a number of significant accomplishments during a highly challenging period in the commercial airline industry 
our operations continued to grow as we took delivery of new boeing b aircraft while inaugurating service to three new cities 
continuing with our aircraft fleet modernization program we retired four mcdonnell douglas dc dc aircraft in addition to retiring the last four aircraft in our boeing b fleet 
we introduced new technologies that more quickly and easily process flight reservation information as well as streamlined the overall check in process for our customers 
other strategic systems were implemented to optimize the scheduling of our flight crews and to automate key maintenance and engineering functions 
during the second quarter of  we successfully refinanced a portion of our debt obligations and recorded our tenth consecutive quarter of profitability excluding special items 
following the terrorist attacks against the united states on september  the september events we were faced with significant challenges to our operational and financial performance 
despite a slowing us economy  which was generally having a negative effect on the demand for air travel prior to september   we believe we would have been profitable in the third and fourth quarters of the year were it not for the significant effect of the september events 
the recent challenges have kept us focused on maintaining our low cost structure and have spurred innovative solutions to new market development 
for example  using a market development program which we call the public private partnership we have joined with several local government and business interests to develop revenue guarantee programs and other marketing incentives to lessen the risks of new market entry 
in addition  capacity reductions by certain major air carriers have created a number of opportunities which previously did not exist 
looking forward to  we anticipate returning to profitability in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year 
we expect operating revenues to grow as we increase asm capacity by percent including a resumption of flights which were curtailed following the september events representing approximately five percent 
we plan to add b aircraft while retiring dc s  resulting in a net increase of six aircraft on a year over year basis 
in  particularly following the september events  certain operating expenses  primarily security and aircraft insurance costs  significantly increased compared to historical averages while fuel prices declined 
our security and aircraft insurance expenses are expected to remain significantly higher in compared to the costs we have experienced in the past 
although we were able to offset these increased operating expenses in with lower fuel prices  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to offset any additional expenses resulting from further changes to security procedures or modifications to aircraft insurance costs 
results of operations compared to summary we recorded a net loss  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  of million in per diluted share compared to net income of million per diluted share 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for  which related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was million per diluted share  net of taxes of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our operating income for  including special items of million  was million compared to million in the special items in operating income reflect reductions in aircraft fleet values  aircraft lease termination charges  special charges related to the september events and the entire amount of compensation we expect to receive from the us government pursuant to the stabilization act 
our nonoperating expenses for  including a special item of million  was million compared to million in the special item in nonoperating expenses represents additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes 
upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs associated with our convertible notes 
a summary of the special items  including where the amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  is listed below in millions income expense description operating nonoperating total reduction of b and dc fleet values and lease termination charges see note september th special charges see note government grant see note debt discount amortization see note the net effect of these special items reduced our net income loss from million to million and reduced our earnings loss per common share from to 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
we increased our capacity available seat miles or asms by percent due to the continuation of our fleet renewal program which resulted in the addition of b aircraft and the retirement of four dc and four b aircraft during the year 
our traffic revenue passenger miles or rpms increased by percent which when combined with the increase in asms resulted in a percentage point decline in our passenger load factor 
our passenger yields also declined by percent to cents per rpm  which in conjunction with the higher traffic resulted in a million increase in our passenger revenues 
cargo revenues declined by million during the year due to the fact that we carried less mail for the us postal service 
our financial results for the first eight months of were considerably different from those of the remainder of the year primarily due to the impact of the september events on our passenger revenues 
with the intent of providing a more meaningful understanding of this effect  we will further discuss the results in two time periods as follows january through august  and september through december 
for the period of january through august  the slowing of the us economy resulted initially in greater price awareness by air travelers followed by an overall decline in the demand for air travel 
this increased price awareness tended to benefit low fare airlines during this time period  as demonstrated by our revenue performance 
despite a nearly percent increase in capacity during this period  we experienced even higher levels of passenger demand which resulted in our load factor increasing by percentage points over the same period in the previous year 
our passenger yields also increased by percent to cents per rpm 
this resulted in our passenger revenues increasing by million over the comparable period in our passenger revenues for the period from september through december were significantly affected by the september events 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the federal aviation administration faa immediately issued a federal ground stop order on september th  which prohibited all civil aviation flights from operation within the national airspace of the united states 
the us airspace was not reopened until september th  at which time we operated a portion of our pre september th scheduled operations 
once flights resumed  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than we had experienced prior to september th 
in an effort to match our capacity to the reduced level of demand  we reduced our operations to levels similar to those we operated during the same period in  despite the fact that we had been successful in growing our capacity by percent earlier in the year 
in addition  many corporations curtailed their busi ness travel and leisure travelers cancelled or postponed vacations  which forced airlines to reduce airfares in an attempt to stimulate demand 
despite these actions  our traffic dropped by over percent which resulted in our passenger load factor declining eight percentage points compared to the previous year 
passenger yields also suffered during this period and declined nearly percent year over year 
this resulted in a million  or percent  decline in passenger revenues compared to the same time period in operating expenses our operating expenses increased by million percent on an asm increase of percent 
excluding the special items recognized during that are described above  our operating expenses increased by million percent 
operating cost per available seat mile casm  excluding the special items  increased percent from cents to cents  primarily due to the aircraft rent associated with the lease financing of a greater number of aircraft and increased personnel costs 
operating expenses per asm for and were as follows percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents marketing and advertising aircraft rent depreciation other operating total casm casm figures above were adjusted to exclude the following special items impairment loss lease termination of million  special charges of million and a government grant of million 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to increases in the number of employees to support our year over year growth  in addition to contractual wage and benefit increases for our employee groups represented by labor unions 
aircraft fuel expense  including fuel hedging activities  decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to a percent decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel  offset by a percent increase in the quantity of fuel consumed in our flight operations 
our average price per gallon of aircraft fuel  including all fees and taxes  was cents in compared to cents in the and prices are net of million and million in hedging gains losses  respectively 
the improvement in aircraft fuel casm reflects the increased number of b aircraft and the retirement of dc and b aircraft during maintenance  materials and repairs decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to fewer dc and b airframe and engine repairs performed in accordance with our maintenance schedule 
the timing of maintenance to be performed is predominantly determined by the number of hours the aircraft and engines are operated and their age 
during  we retired the b aircraft type from our operating fleet in addition to four dc aircraft 
the composition of our aircraft fleet continued to shift towards a greater percentage of new b aircraft which generally require less costly and less frequent scheduled maintenance 
distribution expenses increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to a higher volume of transactions incurring computer reservations system crs fees 
our enplanement increase of percent and million growth in passenger revenues generally correlated to a greater amount of sales subject to credit card transaction fees and sales commissions 
credit card and commission expenses were up percent and percent  respectively 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to our operations growth  in terms of both the number of cities served and total departures 
service to four new cities was introduced in grand bahama island  minneapolis st 
paul  pittsburgh and toledo  three new cities were introduced in baltimore washington  pensacola and tallahassee 
our facilities rent increased million  a significant portion of which came from the new cities we served 
our expanded operations generated an percent increase in the level of departures  which in turn raised our landing fees by million 
marketing and advertising expenses grew by million percent overall  but flat on a casm basis as we increased our promotional activity to support our inauguration of service to three new cities 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis as a result of the lease financing of new b aircraft 
during  we introduced one new b aircraft per month into our fleet  until december when three bs were added  for a total of new lease financed aircraft 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we lease financed three b aircraft which had been delivered in the fourth quarter of with interim financing from the manufacturer 
depreciation expense increased by million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to an increase in dc capitalized improvements  the reassessment of our b salvage values and the provisioning of spare parts for our growing b aircraft fleet 
other operating expenses increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to significant increases to passenger liability insurance coverage and security costs in the fourth quarter of  employee training costs and passenger related costs associated with our growth during impairment loss lease termination expenses represent million of charges related to decreases in the fair market values of our dc and b aircraft fleets 
these charges were calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a b lease 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges primarily represent operating costs incurred during the faa s ground stop order following the september events 
government grant represents the entire amount of compensation we expect to receive from the us government pursuant to the stabilization act 
this amount is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating expenses other expense  net  included interest income and interest expense  a special item and an adjustment related to our fuel hedges in accordance with sfas interest income decreased percent primarily due to lower rates of return on invested cash  partially offset by higher amounts of invested cash 
interest expense decreased percent primarily due to overall lower debt obligations  partially offset by higher interest rates associated with our refinanced debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the special item represents additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes 
upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs associated with our convertible notes 
these amounts are shown on the consolidated statements of operations as convertible debt discount amortization 
in accordance with sfas see notes and to t he consolidated financial statements we also recognized fuel hedging gains of million 
provision for income taxes our income tax expense was million compared to in the prior year 
the tax expense resulted from the utilization of a portion of our million of net operating loss nol carryforwards existing at december   offset in part by alternative minimum tax and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation  inc nol carryforwards 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of operating loss carryforwards  because our evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of tax benefits of such loss carryforwards indicates that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contain risks that do not provide sufficient assurance to recognize such tax benefits currently 
compared to summary for  we recorded operating income of million  pre tax income and net income of million and earnings per common share of on a diluted basis 
for  including a pre tax impairment charge of million and a litigation settlement gain of million  we recorded an operating loss of million  a pre tax loss of million  a net loss of million and a loss per common share of on a basic and diluted basis 
the impairment loss and litigation settlement gain increased our loss per common share by 
operating revenues operating revenues increased by million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was principally driven by a percentage point increase in load factor and a percent increase in passenger yield 
as a result  our unit revenue or rasm increased percent to cents 
during  we increased our capacity  or asms  by percent with the addition of eight new b aircraft 
in addition  rpms increased by percent  resulting in a record load factor of percent 
the increase in passenger yield resulted primarily from additional business travelers purchasing higher fares during the year 
notwithstanding the improved passenger yield and passenger load factor  we continue to experience aggressive competition that could negatively impact future yields and loads 
other revenues decreased million percent 
excluding a litigation settlement gain of million in  other revenues increased million or percent on a year over year basis 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million percent 
excluding the pre tax sfas impairment charge of million to reduce the book value of our dc aircraft  operating expenses increased by million or percent 
casm increased by percent  primarily due to a percent increase in aircraft fuel expense 
excluding fuel costs  casm decreased approximately percent to cents per asm 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to contractual wage rate increases and additional personnel required for the higher level of operations in aircraft fuel expense increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to increases in the cost of fuel 
during  the average cost of aircraft fuel per gallon was approximately  compared to an average cost per gallon in of approximately 
the cost of aircraft fuel was net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities in and  respectively 
maintenance  materials and repairs decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to a lesser number of b and dc airframe and engine repairs performed during in accordance with our maintenance schedule 
the timing of maintenance to be performed is determined by the number of hours the aircraft and engines are operated and their age 
distribution expenses increased million percent overall  but flat on a casm basis primarily due to an increase in commissionable sales generated by travel agents  offset by a rate reduction from percent to percent during the fourth quarter of landing fees and other rents increased million percent overall  but flat on a casm basis primarily due to increased departures 
on a casm basis  these expenses remained flat on a year over year basis 
we operated  departures in and  departures in  an increase of percent 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the lease financing associated with five of the eight new bs delivered during  as well as the sale leaseback of seven dc aircraft in the fourth quarter of depreciation expense decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the reduction in book value of our dc fleet as a result of the sfas impairment charge and the sale leaseback of seven dc aircraft in the fourth quarter of other operating expenses increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to increased passenger related expenses associated with the greater number of passengers served  and to costs related to supporting and maintaining our existing automation systems 
impairment loss lease termination expenses reflect the decision we made in the fourth quarter of to accelerate the retirement of our owned dc fleet to accommodate the introduction of the b fleet 
this million impairment charge was recorded in accordance with sfas and is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating expenses interest expense  net  increased percent  primarily due to the debt financing of eight b aircraft delivered in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as three bs delivered in the fourth quarter the deliveries were financed utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs 
three of the deliveries were financed utilizing debt issued by an affiliate of the airframe manufacturer 
offsetting a portion of the increased interest expense  interest income increased percent as a result of higher invested cash balances 
provision for income taxes as of december   we had not recognized any benefit from the future use of operating loss carryforwards  because our evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of tax benefits of such loss carryforwards indicated that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contained risks that did not provide sufficient assurance to recognize such tax benefits at that time 
as a result  income tax expense was and million in and  respectively 
the tax expense resulted from the utilization of a portion of our million of nol carryforwards existing at december   offset in part by alternative minimum tax and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation  inc nol carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily on operating cash flows to provide working capital 
we presently have no lines of credit or short term borrowing facilities 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  totaled million compared to million at december  the deferral of million in excise tax payments until january in accordance with the stabilization act is reflected in our year end cash balance 
we generally must satisfy all of our working capital expenditure requirements from cash provided by operating activities  from external capital sources or from the sale of assets 
substantial portions of our assets have been pledged to secure various issues of our outstanding indebtedness 
to the extent the pledged assets are sold  the applicable financing agreements generally require the sales proceeds to be applied to repay the corresponding indebtedness 
to the extent our access to capital is constrained  we may not be able to make certain capital expenditures or continue to implement certain other aspects of our strategic plan 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash increased by million compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for  a million increase over the prior year 
our operating cash flow results for reflect the receipt of million from the us department of transportation and the deferral of million in excise tax payments until january in accordance with the stabilization act 
net cash used for investing activities was million and consisted of purchases of property and equipment and the payment of aircraft purchase deposits offset in part by proceeds from the disposal of equipment 
in  we sold bs of which were acquired from boeing during  as discussed below under our lease financing commitment with boeing capital services corporation boeing capital 
our lease financing commitment was for the purchase and sale leaseback of up to bs 
by the end of all aircraft under this commitment were purchased with corresponding sale leaseback transactions completed 
related to the refinancing of certain debt obligations see other information below  boeing capital s purchase price under the lease financing commitment was increased by million per aircraft for the fourth through twentieth b deliveries  or million in the aggregate 
the majority of these transactions with boeing capital  including the related debt repayments see othe r information below  are noncash items 
our property and equipment purchases primarily consisted of spare parts and equipment provisioning for the b aircraft  and to a lesser extent capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and computer equipment to support our operations growth particularly in the three new cities now served 
in  we paid million in purchase deposits for future b aircraft deliveries 
net cash used for financing activities was primarily related to the refinancing of certain debt obligations associated with the boeing capital transactions see other information below 
as of december   our deliveries of bs from the boeing company boeing totaled aircraft 
initially  we contracted with boeing to purchase bs for delivery between and  with options to purchase an additional bs 
during  we revised our contracts with boeing relating to the purchase and financing of our future b aircraft deliveries  in addition to recharacterizing the option aircraft to provide for options  purchase rights and five rolling options 
the options and purchase rights  to the extent exercised  would provide for delivery to us of all of our bs on or before september  prior to this revision  we had committed to purchase bs during the following years eight aircraft  eight aircraft  aircraft and aircraft 
also prior to the revision  the option aircraft  if exercised  would have been available for delivery between january and january as of december   our remaining commitments with respect to b aircraft were for the acquisition of aircraft in and aircraft in aggregate funding  net of previously paid purchase deposits  required for these aircraft commitments was approximately million at december  on march   we amended our b purchase contract as follows i our commitments to acquire bs in increased from aircraft to aircraft  comprised of firm and seven option aircraft  ii our commitments to acquire bs in decreased from aircraft to aircraft  comprised of nine firm and one option aircraft  and iii purchase deposits that were previously paid for aircraft deliveries in will be applied to future aircraft deliveries  rather than reducing the balance of the total purchase price due at delivery 
although we expect to finance the acquisition of these aircraft  we did not have financing in place for these aircraft as of december  we have sinc e signed a lease financing proposal from boeing capital for at boeing capital s option new or previously owned b aircraft to be delivered in according to this proposal  the lease term for each of these aircraft commences upon delivery and will continue for to years  at which time we can renew the lease at fair market rental or purchase the aircraft at the greater of a predetermined amount or its fair market value 
if completed as contemplated  this lease financing will reduce our aggregate funding requirements for aircraft commitments to million representing the aircraft to be purchased for funding is subject to finalization of definitive agreements and other conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to future b option deliveries  we had options  purchase rights and five rolling options at december  three of the options were exercised with two bs having been delivered in  and one b exercised for a scheduled delivery in  one option expired unexercised 
in connection with the amendments discussed above  we will exercise an additional seven options  for which no additional purchase deposit payments will be required  with delivery scheduled for if we exercise our options to acquire additional aircraft  additional payments could be required for these aircraft beginning in there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
during  we took delivery of new b aircraft that were financed by boeing capital as follows were delivered and simultaneously sold and leased back from boeing capital  and one was purchased with a loan provided by boeing capital the loan was fully repaid in february and the aircraft was contemporaneously sold and leased back from boeing capital 
as of december   our debt obligations totaled million  with respect to which substantially all our assets are pledged as security 
our debt obligations are comprised of million of eetcs  of which a portion of interest and principal is payable semiannually through april  and certain debt obligations due to boeing capital  as described in other information below 
the eetc proceeds were used to replace loans for the purchase of the first b aircraft delivered all aircraft were pledged as collateral for the eetcs 
eight eetc financed bs were delivered in  and the remaining two deliveries occurred in during  we sold and leased back two of the eetc financed bs in a leveraged lease transaction reducing the outstanding principal amount of the eetcs by million 
in addition to our million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december   we have other financing sources available to meet our future liquidity requirements  including  but not limited to i the receipt of the remaining million of the us government grant  ii securitization of future operating receipts  iii unsecured borrowings  and iv any borrowings backed by federal loan guarantees pursuant to the stabilization act 
our contractual obligations and commitments to be paid were the following as of december  in millions nature of commitment there after operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations aircraft purchase commitments long term debt obligations total contractual obligations and commitments net of previously paid purchase deposits 
excludes related interest payments 
our contractual obligations and commitments  as described in the preceding table  have been modified by the amendments to our b purchase contract described above and would be modified if transactions subject to the lease financing proposal from boeing capital are completed as contemplated 
the lease financing proposal provides for the lease finance of a total of bs scheduled for delivery during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts in the table above have been modified by the amendments as follows i aircraft purchase commitments have increased for and decreased for  and ii purchase deposits that were previously paid for aircraft deliveries in will be applied to future aircraft deliveries  rather than reducing the balance of the total purchase price due at delivery 
the amounts in the table above would also be modified by the lease financing proposal as follows i aggregate operating lease payments for aircraft would increase for all periods  and ii aggregate aircraft purchase commitments would decrease in our contractual obligations and commitments after giving effect to the above described amendments and lease financing proposal  are as follows in millions there after revised total contractual obligations and commitments a variety of assumptions were necessary in order to derive the information described in the paragraph herein  including  but not limited to i our decision to acquire new versus previously owned b aircraft  ii the timing of aircraft delivery dates  and iii estimated rental factors which are correlated to floating interest rates prior to delivery 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other information we entered into an amended and restated financing commitment with boeing capital on march   and a series of definitive agreements on april   in order to refinance our million senior notes and airtran airways  inc s million senior secured notes due april collectively  the existing notes  and to provide additional liquidity 
the cash flow generated from the boeing capital transactions  together with internally generated funds  was used to retire the existing notes at maturity 
the components of the refinancing are as follows in thousands senior secured notes of airtran airways  inc due subordinated notes of airtran holdings  inc due convertible notes of airtran holdings  inc due under the new senior secured notes issued by our operating subsidiary  airtran airways  principal payments of approximately million plus interest are due and payable semiannually 
in addition  there are certain mandatory prepayment events  including a million prepayment upon the consummation of each of eleven sale leaseback transactions for b aircraft 
during  all eleven prepayments were completed 
the new senior secured notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of airtran airways not previously encumbered  and are noncallable for four years 
in the fifth year  the senior secured notes may be prepaid at a premium of four percent and in the sixth year at a premium of two percent 
contemporaneously with the issuance of the new senior secured notes  we issued detachable warrants to boeing capital for the purchase of three million shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrants have an estimated value of million and expire in five years 
this amount is bei ng amortized to interest expense over the life of the new senior secured notes 
under the subordinated notes  interest is due and payable semiannually in arrears  and no principal payments are due prior to maturity in  except for mandatory prepayments equal to percent of airtran airways net income which  subject to applicable law  airtran airways is required to dividend to us in cash on a quarterly basis for payment to the lender 
during  we paid million in principal on the subordinated notes in accordance with the requirements to pay percent of airtran airways quarterly net income 
the convertible notes bear a higher rate of interest  specifically percent if our average common stock price during a calendar month is below 
if our average common stock price remained below each calendar month of  we would incur approximately million in additional expense under this provision 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears 
the notes are convertible at any time into approximately million shares of our common stock 
this conversion rate represents a beneficial conversion feature valued at approximately million 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible notes  or sooner upon conversion 
we are able to require boeing capital s conversion of the notes under certain circumstances 
during the third quarter of  boeing capital exercised approximately two thirds of their conversion rights resulting in a decrease of million of principal on the convertible notes 
in connection with the conversion  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to boeing capital 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs 
these amounts are shown on the consolidated statements of operations as other income expense convertible debt discount amortization 
the subordinated notes and convertible notes are secured by a pledge of all of our rights under the b aircraft purchase agreement with the mcdonnell douglas corporation an affiliate of boeing capital  and a subordinated lien on the collateral securing the new senior secured notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accoun ting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger and cargo revenue is recognized when transportation is provided 
transportation purchased but not yet used is included in air traffic liability 
accounting for long lived assets 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of december   including approximately million of flight equipment and related equipment 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by us including estimated useful lives  salvage values and in and  impairment charges 
effective july   in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful lives of our b aircraft  we changed the estimate of the useful life of this aircraft type from to years 
as a result of this change  depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be reduced by approximately million on an annualized basis going forward 
in accordance with sfas  we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges exp ected to result from the use and eventual disposition of assets are less than the aggregate carrying amount of the assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
during  we determined our dc and b aircraft fleets were impaired in accordance with sfas and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
during  we also recorded an impairment charge of million on our dc aircraft fleet in accordance with sfas these charges are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
spare parts  materials and supplies 
spare parts  materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method fifo 
these items are charged to expense when used 
allowances for obsolescence are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply sfas beginning in the first quarter of and discontinue the amortization of our trade name  an indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill 
application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in net income in of approximately million 
per share 
we will be required to test the goodwill and trade name for impairment annually in accordance with sfas we have performed the first of the required impairment tests for the trade name and goodwill as of january  and will not have any impairment of these assets upon adoption 
on october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supersedes sfas  and applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations 
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our future financial position or results of operations 
b aircraft program update boeing recently evaluated the production and delivery schedules of its commercial airplane programs  in light of current market conditions 
after a thorough evaluation of the program and market  boeing made a business decision to continue production of the b while boeing stated the b is the leading passenger airplane  due to reduced near term demand following the september events  the program will go forward with a lower production rate and revised delivery projections 
our delivery schedule has not been affected by boeing s decision to lower production rates 
in  we anticipate taking delivery of new bs 
new service we recently announced the launch of new service from rochester  new york and wichita  kansas  our th and th destinations  respectively 
our new service to these new cities is a result of their local governments and business interests providing revenue guarantee programs and other marketing incentives to lessen the risks of our entry into these new markets 
nonstop service from rochester to atlanta  georgia and baltimore washington international airport bwi begins in march nonstop service from wichita to atlanta  georgia and chicago  illinois midway international airport begins in may during  we inaugurated new service to bwi  and the florida cities of tallahassee and pensacola 
the new service to tallahassee is the result of agreements with the city of tallahassee offering revenue guarantees  reduced facility costs and marketing incentives  as well as an exclusive air service contract with the state of florida 
the commencement of service to pensacola coincided with simultaneous termination of service to fort walton beach  florida 
the pensacola airport  chamber of commerce and other gulf coast parties presented us with an incentive package that includes reduced facilities costs and marketing dollars  as well as covering moving expenses 
more than corporate  government and other entities committed funds to an air travel bank in support of this new service 
item a
