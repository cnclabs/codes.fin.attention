item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
hrp believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases requires management to estimate the economic life of lease payments 
however  this does not require subjective input by management  as rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term  as defined in each respective lease 
these adjustments to convert cash rental income which may include free rent and periodic rental rate increases over the term of the lease to straight line rental income increased revenues by   and  in   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets hrp records impairment losses on its real estate assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired or the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of that asset 
in such cases  an impaired asset would be written down to its fair value 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
for the three years ended december   hrp has not recorded a write down  or impairment of the carrying value of any real estate property  based on these calculations 
page of liquidity and capital resources continued significant and other accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financials statements in item the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
cash sources  cash uses and commitments hrp s cash position increased  during to  as of december  the sources of cash during the year were  of cash provided by operating activities   of mortgage principal proceeds   of net cash proceeds from property sales  and  of litigation judgment and interest described in item legal proceedings 
the uses of cash were  for property and tenant improvements   for property development costs   for scheduled mortgage principal payments   of mortgage principal repayments from mortgage refinance proceeds   for the early payoff of mortgage principal in conjunction with a property sale   for mortgage prepayment penalties  and  for loan fees and expenses 
for the foreseeable future  hrp anticipates that mortgage principal payments  tenant and capital improvements  lease commissions and litigation costs will be funded by net cash from operations 
we believe that there will be sufficient cash from operations to meet these needs because hrp has leases in place as of december  to provide  of minimum rental payments during see lease agreements and major tenant information discussed within item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
hrp had  of minimum rental payments estimated for based on leases in place as of december   however the actual rental payments recorded for were  our ability to fund operations in the future will depend upon continued success in maintaining current occupancy levels  retaining current tenants  and attracting new tenants 
the primary sources of capital to fund any future acquisitions or developments will be proceeds from the sale  financing or refinancing of one or more of its properties 
each quarter realty reviews hrp s capacity to make cash distributions 
hrp has not made any cash distributions since february  in addition to the commitment described below with regards to the development project at executive park  hrp has estimated and budgeted tenant and capital improvements of  and lease commissions of  for property development at executive park in early  hrp demolished a story office building at its executive park property in atlanta  georgia that contained  net rentable square feet 
in order to do so  hrp had to obtain a release of the building from executive park s mortgage lien by substituting for such collateral  of united states treasury bonds  which have various maturity dates through december in february  hrp began constructing a story office building containing  net rentable square feet 
the estimated construction and development costs for the building and its parking garage excluding the existing land costs  lease commissions and tenant improvements to be spent after a lease is executed  and loan fees once financing is secured are approximately  as of december   hrp had incurred and capitalized  of construction and development costs 
the building and its parking garage  excluding tenant finish out  is estimated to be completed by the end of march  all development costs have been and are estimated to continue to be from existing cash funds until the property is substantially leased  at which time it is anticipated that loan financing will be secured 
costs for lease commissions  tenant improvements and loan fees are dependant upon the terms of each lease agreement and yet to be determined  as no pre leasing has been done 
hrp anticipates leasing substantially all of the building by late risks  competition and other factors for information about risks  see risks  competition and other factors in item business

accounting standards in august  sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
the provisions of this statement are effective for hrp beginning on january  hrp believes that the impact of adopting sfas no 
will be limited to the requirement that the results of operations of disposed properties  for current and historical presentation  be classified as discontinued operations 
this will result in the reclassification of historical operations for property dispositions that occur in current periods

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on july   hrp sold its interest rate swap agreement for  hrp had entered into the interest rate swap agreement in to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates for the loan secured by allfirst building 
this interest rate swap agreement effectively fixed the loan s cash interest rate at  as opposed to the mortgage loan interest rate of libor plus or at the time of the swap agreement sale 
the proceeds from the sale were designated for general working capital purposes 
for financial reporting purposes  the proceeds are being amortized over the life of the loan as a reduction to interest expense

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities hrp reclassified the remaining unamortized gain from liabilities to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the proceeds will continue to be amortized over the life of allfirst building s mortgage payable as a reduction to interest expense 
as of december   the unamortized balance  included on the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income  was  also on july  and in connection with the sale of the swap agreement  hrp purchased an interest rate cap for allfirst building s mortgage loan for  which limits hrp s exposure to changing interest rates to a maximum of 
this interest rate cap  which has a notional amount of  has terms consistent with allfirst building s mortgage loan 
allfirst building s cash interest rate was and as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate cap is a derivative and designated as a cash flow hedge 
hedge effectiveness is measured based on using the intrinsic value of the interest rate cap 
all changes in the fair value of the time value of the cap are recorded directly to earnings 
with the january  adoption sfas no 
 hrp recorded the cumulative effect of the adoption as a reduction to income of  or the amount of the difference between the carrying value as of january  of  and the then estimated fair value of  all of which represented change in time value

accordingly  changes in libor or the prime rate do not significantly impact the amount of interest paid by hrp 
assuming a basis point  or  change in libor  interest paid by hrp would increase or decrease by approximately  on an annual basis
