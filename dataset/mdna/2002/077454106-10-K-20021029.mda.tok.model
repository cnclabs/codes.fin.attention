sales attributable to acquisitions represented approximately of fiscal sales 
sales for the network communication segment decreased to million  and represented of total company revenue for fiscal the lower sales for this segment were primarily due to a decline in sales of products for the telecommunication marketplace  excluding sales attributable to acquired businesses 
sales for the specialty electronic segment were million  a decrease of over the prior year 
the reduction in sales for this segment was primarily due to lower sales of industrial cables  reflecting decreased demand from electronic equipment manufacturers in response to the economic slowdown 
the reported operating margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the operating margin  excluding in both years the business restructuring expenses and other charges discussed below  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the following business restructuring and other charges totaling million million net of tax were incurred in fiscal a charge of million million net of tax  included in cost of sales  represents a provision for slow moving inventory associated with products for the telecommunication central office marketplace 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include a million million net of tax provision for a lawsuit currently in discovery  and whose worst case exposure is estimated at million 
although the outcome of this matter is not certain at this time  the provision represents management and outside counsel s most likely estimate of exposure 
fiscal business restructuring expenses of million million net of tax consist of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions  a million asset impairment charge associated with property and equipment to be held for sale as a result of facility consolidations  and million of asset provisions incurred in connection with the closing of the company s wireless assembly facility  representing primarily the write off of inventory applicable to terminated customer contracts

year ended july  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill research and development expenses income from operations excludes million inventory provision in fiscal associated with products for the telecommunication marketplace 
excludes million provision for a lawsuit in fiscal excludes a million bad debt provision related to the bankruptcy of a customer in fiscal excludes charges described in notes   and for the respective periods 
excludes business restructuring expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
excludes million of restructuring income in fiscal year ended july  compared with year ended july  sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million compared to sales of million for fiscal sales attributable to acquisitions  which were primarily in the network communication segment  represented approximately of fiscal sales 
network communication segment sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to sales of million for fiscal the lower sales for this segment were primarily due to the slowdown in both the us and european economies  and in the telecommunication marketplace that began in the second half of the company s fiscal year 
sales of products for the telecommunication market continue to be affected by very low demand  decreasing year over year excluding sales attributable to acquired businesses 
network product sales decreased  primarily due to a decline in sales of the lower performance category cable and a decline in sales of connectivity products 
sales of the higher performance gigabit network cable remained relatively stable on a year over year basis  with slightly increased volumes and improved product mix offsetting the negative impact of declines in pricing 
specialty electronic segment sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in sales for this segment was primarily due to lower sales of industrial cables  due to lower demand from electronic equipment manufacturers in response to the economic slowdown 
sales outside of north america were million for fiscal  a decrease of compared to sales of million for fiscal the decline in international sales was primarily due to lower sales of network and telecommunication related products in europe  which was partially offset by sales attributable to acquired businesses 
gross profit for fiscal decreased to million compared to million for fiscal the decline in gross profit was due to lower sales volumes  as well as lower gross margins in both business segments 
the reduction in gross profit was partially mitigated by the company s cost reduction actions during fiscal the decrease in the segment gross margins was primarily due to volume inefficiencies and greater pricing pressure for the company s products 
volume inefficiencies were due to the absorption of manufacturing expenses over lower production levels  particularly for telecommunication equipment related products 
pricing pressures resulted from the slowdown in both the economy and particularly the telecommunication marketplace 
gross profit for fiscal was also negatively impacted by a million provision for slow moving inventory associated with products for the central office telecommunication marketplace 
excluding this provision  the gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal sg a decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal excluding the additional sg a of acquired businesses  the decline in sg a was million  or  primarily due to lower sales volume related expenses  reduced employee related costs resulting in part from restructuring activities  and a decrease in bad debt provisions 
the year over year decline in bad debt expense was partially due to the fact that a million bad debt charge was incurred in fiscal related to the bankruptcy of a customer 
these declines in sg a were partially offset by a million fiscal provision for a lawsuit currently in discovery  and whose worst case exposure is estimated at million 
excluding the million provision in fiscal and the million bad debt charge in fiscal  sg a as a percentage of sales increased to this year compared to for fiscal  reflecting the lower sales volume 
research and development expenses decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal business restructuring expenses of million million net of tax were incurred in fiscal  including million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions and a million charge associated with property and equipment to be held for sale and other costs incurred in connection with the closing of the company s wireless assembly facility 
approximately million of the fiscal restructuring expenses were associated with operations in the network communication segment 
business restructuring expenses for fiscal of million million net of tax include million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions  a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  and a million loss on the sale of a business 
approximately million of the fiscal restructuring expenses were associated with operations in the network communication segment 
reported income from operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income from operations  excluding business restructuring expenses and other charges see overview in both years  was million  or of sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal net interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due both to a lower average interest rate and a lower average balance of outstanding debt 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the high effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the unfavorable relative effect of permanent non deductible expenses on lower pretax income  as well as an unfavorable effect due to the geographical mix of taxable earnings 
for fiscal  million of the business restructuring expenses for goodwill impairment and loss on the sale of a business were not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of these non deductible business restructuring expenses  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
reported diluted earnings per share were for fiscal on net income of million  compared to for fiscal on net income of million 
diluted earnings per share  excluding the net of tax impact of the restructuring and other charges see overview  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the lower fiscal net income was primarily due to the effect of the lower sales volume and the lower gross margin percentage 
year ended july  compared with year ended july  sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the year ended july  fiscal 
sales attributable to acquisitions represented approximately of fiscal sales 
network communication segment sales declined  to million for fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal the decline in sales for this segment was primarily due to a decline in sales of wireless products attributable to the previously reported loss of the principal customer for wireless assembly services 
additionally  the slowdown in the us economy and the telecommunication market which began in the second half of the fiscal year negatively impacted sales in the network communication segment  including sales of computer interconnect products  primarily for telecom switching applications  which declined and central office products which increased only for the full year compared to a increase for the first half of fiscal an increase of in sales of enhanced gigabit network cables was more than offset by a decline in sales of the lower performance rated category network cable 
another area of growth was a increase in sales of fiber optic connectivity products  primarily single mode cable 
fiscal sales for the specialty electronic segment decreased million  or  to million 
incremental sales attributable to businesses acquired during fiscal contributed million to sales for this segment 
excluding acquisitions  the sales decline in this segment was primarily due to lower sales of industrial cables  which the company believes reflects adjusted inventory levels at electronic equipment distributors in response to the economic slowdown 
sales outside of north america increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to the acquisition of itc cdt in fiscal year  as well as higher first half sales of central office cable products in western europe 
these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effect on sales by the company s european subsidiaries due to a decline in the value of certain european currencies against the dollar 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decline in gross profit was due to lower sales volume  as well as reduced gross margins for both the network communication and specialty electronic segments primarily due to volume inefficiencies as a result of the lower sales volume 
the overall gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the lower network communication segment gross margin was primarily due to lower margins for network cable  network structured wiring components  computer interconnect  and outside plant communication cable 
in addition to volume inefficiencies  the gross margin for this segment was unfavorably impacted by lower pricing on category and e network cable and a shift in product mix for structured wiring components 
the reduction in gross margin for the specialty electronic segment was due to a lower margin for automation and process control products due primarily to a higher average cost of copper  volume inefficiencies and competitive market conditions  as well as a lower margin for aerospace and automotive cables due to product mix 
sg a increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense  the additional sg a of acquired businesses and costs associated with the establishment of the european and fiber optic management groups in the first fiscal quarter 
the increase in bad debt expense was primarily due to the bankruptcy of a large distribution customer  and higher provisions for bad debts  particularly in the fourth fiscal quarter  due to the slowdown in the telecommunication marketplace and the overall economy 
sg a as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  due to the factors noted above combined with the lower sales volume 
research and development expenses increased million to million compared to million in fiscal business restructuring expenses of million million net of tax were incurred during fiscal related to severance costs  goodwill impairment  and a loss on the sale of a business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a business restructuring expense of million million  net of tax was incurred representing severance costs associated with a workforce reduction of  including workers under contract manufacturing arrangements 
also in the fourth quarter  the company incurred a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million  net of tax 
the majority of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes 
the goodwill impairment charge reflects the company s evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill for certain of its operations based on the estimates of future cash flows for the affected operations 
fiscal business restructuring expenses also include a million loss on the sale of a business in the third quarter 
business restructuring income of million million net of tax was recognized in fiscal reported income from operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income from operations  excluding business restructuring expenses in both years  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal  and the operating margin was for fiscal compared to for fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased million to million compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the lower average balance of debt outstanding  as the company reduced debt by million during fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the fact that million of the business restructuring expenses for goodwill impairment and loss on the sale of a business were not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of the non deductible business restructuring expenses in fiscal  the effective tax rate was 
earnings per share decreased to per diluted share on net income of million for fiscal compared to per diluted share on net income of million for fiscal excluding business restructuring expenses in both years  fiscal earnings per share decreased to per diluted share on net income of million  compared to per diluted share for fiscal on net income of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million  million and million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital accounts  which more than offset a decline in net income 
the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily due to lower net income 
during fiscal operating working capital decreased million 
the decrease in operating working capital was primarily the result of decreases in inventory and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
the change in operating working capital excludes changes in cash and current maturities of long term debt 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal cash used by investing activities included million expended for capital projects and million for the acquisition of businesses 
in fiscal  the company expended million for capital projects and received million of proceeds from the sale of a business 
fiscal cash used for investing included million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisition of businesses 
capital expenditures were primarily invested in additional equipment to expand capacity for both network communication and specialty electronic products 
capital expenditures in fiscal included approximately million to purchase two previously leased buildings 
net cash used by financing activities during fiscal of million included million to reduce debt and million for payment of deferred financing fees  which were partially offset by million received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock pursuant to the company s employee stock purchase plan

in fiscal  the company used million for financing activities  including a debt reduction of million 
the company received million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock in fiscal the company entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility on december  which provides for borrowings of up to million the us facility  including a million european sub facility and a million uk sub facility 
the company also entered into a separate million revolving facility for it s canadian operations the canadian facility  which facility is supported by a letter of credit under the us facility and reduces the availability under the us facility 
the us and canadian facilities expire on january  and december   respectively 
borrowings under the us facility bear interest at either libor plus to  or a base rate  as defined  plus to 
the applicable interest rate margin is based on the company s leverage ratio as calculated under the facility 
a facility fee margin of to  which is also based on the company s leverage ratio  is payable on the maximum facility amount 
fees for letters of credit under the us facility are charged at the applicable interest rate margin 
borrowings under the canadian facility bear interest at the canadian banker s acceptance rate  plus an applicable margin of 
a facility fee of is payable on the canadian facility 
as of july   the company had availability of approximately million and million under the us facility and canadian facility  respectively 
on october   the company and the agent under the us and canadian facilities reached an agreement whereby the company reduced total available borrowings under the us and canadian facilities to million  reduced the european and uk sub facility limits to million and million  respectively  and provided security for the loans in the form of a pledge of substantially all of the company s us and canadian non real estate assets 
the us and canadian facilities have customary financial and non financial covenants 
the financial covenants consist of fixed charge and leverage ratios and a minimum net worth test 
compliance with these covenants is dependant on a number of factors  including  in the case of the fixed charge ratio  trailing four fiscal quarter capital expenditures and tax  interest and scheduled principal payments and  in the case of the leverage ratio  the company s consolidated debt 
important to both of these ratios is the company s net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as calculated under the us facility  for the trailing four fiscal quarters 
in the case of the leverage ratio  pro forma adjustments are made to ebitda for acquisitions and  in the case of both ratios  add backs to ebitda are permitted at the discretion of the lenders in the case of certain types of charges 
the company is currently in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants 
continued compliance with the financial covenants is dependent on the levels of the various components that are included in the calculations 
based on current expectations  management believes that the company s cash flow from operations and the available portion of its credit facilities will provide it with sufficient liquidity to meet its current liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of july  payments due per period total less than after payments due year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt    capital leases   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      in july the company entered into a sublease agreement for one of its facilities

outstanding letters of credit as of july  included million in connection with the purchase of itc cdt see note acquisitions under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of july  and  the company also maintained a million bond in connection with workers compensation self insurance in the state of massachusetts 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales  and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales rebates and allowances  product returns  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  long lived assets  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation  and revises its estimates when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowances for sales rebates  discounts  allowances  price protection programs  and product returns are estimated based on historical experience  contract terms  inventory levels at distributors  and other factors 
a decline in market conditions could result in increased estimates of these amounts  resulting in an incremental reduction of net sales 
allowances for bad debts are estimated based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company maintains reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle 
the net realizable market value of inventory is estimated based on current levels and aging of inventory on hand  forecasted demand  market conditions  and other factors 
changes in these factors  including fluctuations in market conditions  could result in additional inventory write downs 
the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets on an ongoing basis when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable 
our evaluation of potential impairment is based upon market prices  if available  or assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that these assets are expected to generate 
judgment is required in determining the timing of the testing  and in the assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows  which are subject to significant uncertainty 
accruals for the estimated costs of restructuring activities are made in accordance with the requirements of emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in some instances  actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time the initial costs were recorded 
the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates  among other things  and relies on actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s defined benefit and postretirement plans 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including changes in tax laws  could result in potential significant losses or gains 
the company accrues for contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require our exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  the company attempts to minimize any effects of inflation on its operating results by controlling costs of operations and  whenever possible  seeking to ensure that selling prices reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
fluctuation in copper price the cost of copper in inventories  including finished goods  reflects purchases over various periods of time ranging from one to several months for each of the company s operations 
for certain communication cable products  profitability is generally not significantly affected by volatility of copper prices as selling prices are generally adjusted for changes in the market price of copper  however  differences in the timing of selling price adjustments do occur and may impact near term results 
for other products  although selling prices are not generally adjusted to directly reflect changes in copper prices  the relief of copper costs from inventory for those operations having longer inventory cycles may affect profitability from one period to the next following periods of significant movement in the cost of copper 
the company does not generally engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of its copper inventory 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices  which arise from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
we seek to minimize these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and  when considered appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments  primarily debt obligations  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for debt obligations by expected maturity date and the currency in which the instrument s cash flows are denominated 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on the rates in effect at the reporting date for the respective debt obligations 
no assumptions have been made for future changes in such variable rates 
the fair value of fixed rate debt obligations as determined under current market interest rate assumptions does not differ materially from the carrying value as presented below 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
expected maturity date for periods ending july  demand there type notes after total us dollar equivalents in millions balance average interest rate short term obligations australian dollar vr long term debt us dollar fr euro fr us dollar vr canadian dollar vr euro vr british pound vr vr variable interest rate  fr fixed interest rate foreign currency exchange rates we have operating subsidiaries located in various countries outside of the united states  including canada  germany  the united kingdom and the czech republic 
foreign currency exposures may arise from transactions entered into by the company s subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary  as well as from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the company s strategy is to negotiate the terms of the derivatives such that they are highly effective  resulting in the change in the fair value of the derivatives largely offsetting the impact of the underlying hedged items 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income see note derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding  and holding all other variables constant  the value of foreign currency forward contracts would have decreased by million as of july  the company had no such contracts outstanding at july  commodity price risk copper is a primary raw material purchased by the company and is purchased from several suppliers 
price terms are generally producers prices at time of shipment 
we do not generally engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of our copper inventory
