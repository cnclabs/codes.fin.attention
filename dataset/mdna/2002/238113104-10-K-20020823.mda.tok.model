dollars in millions  except eps year ended june  net earnings earnings per share  diluted comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales the following table shows sales by product line over the past three fiscal years 
sales by product line dollars in millions year ended june  cardiac assist change from prior year of total sales patient monitoring change from prior year of total sales collagen products change from prior year of total sales vascular grafts change from prior year of total sales genisphere change from prior year of total sales total sales change from prior year net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal years  and shown above include the following special items 
fiscal restructuring charges of million after tax or per diluted share 
fiscal gain on sale of underutilized facility of thousand after tax or per diluted share 
fiscal gain on sale of technology of million after tax or per diluted share 
excluding the special items  net earnings and diluted earnings per share was million or per diluted share in fiscal  million or per diluted share in fiscal and million or per diluted share in fiscal sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 
cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products were million  below a year ago  primarily due to an exceptionally large number of pumps sold last year in the us to replace discontinued pump models 
the worldwide market for intra aortic balloon catheters in fiscal remained essentially unchanged  as growth in international markets offset a decline in the us market 
our strong worldwide market share also remained unchanged 
our new iab catheter  the fidelity fr  which was introduced in february  continues to be well received by customers and accounted for of all datascope balloon catheter unit sales at the end of the fourth quarter  its first full quarter of sales 
the fidelity catheter is priced at a modest premium to the profile catheter which it is intended to replace 
patient monitoring patient monitoring sales rose to a record million for the year 
this strong sales growth is primarily attributable to increased sales in the us of wireless monitoring systems and a continued sharp gain in sales of masimo set pulse oximetry sensors 
the new wireless systems use a protected radio band allocated for medical use by the federal communications commission 
increased sales of passport r portable monitors and accutorr r plus noninvasive blood pressure monitors also contributed to growth 
sales of the collagen products vascular grafts segment were million compared to million last year 
collagen products sales of vasoseal r arterial puncture sealing devices decreased to million  reflecting competitive market conditions and loss of market share 
vasoseal s new deployment technique called modified hold technique  or mht  introduced to the us market in mid april  protects the mechanical seal created by deployment of vasoseal s collagen plug  thereby largely eliminating the previous need for post procedure hold in order to achieve hemostasis 
the apparent usage of vasoseal in those hospitals certified to practice mht is running higher than usage prior to the introduction of mht 
retraining physicians for mht  however  has proved to be more difficult and time consuming than previously anticipated and this has slowed the introduction of mht to about of hospitals purchasing vasoseal at june  we believe that mht will strengthen our competitive position over time as the training process continues and mht is introduced to more physicians and hospitals 
in the fourth quarter  we received the ce mark for vasoseal elite  the next generation of both the es and vhd products  which embodies a new  proprietary hemostat that rapidly expands as it comes into contact with blood 
also in the fourth quarter  we received fda approval for vasoseal low profile  a downsized vhd model aimed at the growing market segment for and fr 
diagnostic procedures 
sales of collagen hemostats increased to million  primarily due to increased sales in international markets 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc increased to million  reflecting continued strong demand for the intergard r silver anti microbial graft in international markets and the contribution from sales of peripheral stents 
total international sales increased for the year 
sales in the us declined as the result of the termination  effective december   of intervascular s former distributor  which placed no orders in the second quarter upon being notified of its termination 
datascope began selling intervascular products through its dedicated direct sales organization in the us in january genisphere in fiscal  genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and sales remained unchanged at million 
investment spending for the development of the genisphere business was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to last year 
the percentage point decline was primarily attributable to a less favorable sales mix as a result of increased sales of lower margin patient monitoring products and decreased sales of higher margin cardiac assist and vasoseal products 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million and increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal compared to last year 
the increased r d expenses reflect our continued companywide focus on new product development and improvement of existing products 
spending on r d reflects investment in new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
the increase in r d expenses were primarily attributable to new product development projects in the patient monitoring and vascular graft product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was primarily attributable to o investment in building a us direct field force for intervascular  inc o filling open field sales positions and territory expansions in cardiac assist and patient monitoring 
the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal restructuring charges in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter 
the restructuring charges consisted of the following 
first quarter o severance expenses  asset write downs  and exit costs related to the closure of the vasoseal manufacturing and r d facility in vaals  the netherlands  and o severance expenses for employee terminations in new jersey facilities 
by the end of the fourth quarter  the manufacture of vasoseal was centralized in the mahwah  new jersey vasoseal facility and the vaals facility was formally closed and put up for sale 
we received fda clearance for manufacturing at the mahwah facility  which also houses vasoseal r d  warehousing and administration 
headcount reductions  primarily in the netherlands  totaled people  or of our worldwide employment 
all of the new jersey based employees left the company effective september  all of the vaals employees left the company by the end of may second quarter o workforce reductions in vasoseal and patient monitoring o costs associated with discontinuing the coronary stent sales business in europe  including the resulting impairment of our investments in amg and qualimed  and o closure of an unprofitable cardiac assist direct sales operation in a european country 
based on the highly competitive stent market in europe and an analysis of the future economic contributions of the stent business  we decided to exit the coronary stent business 
in conjunction with this decision  we decided not to exercise the option to purchase the remaining of the equity of amg and qualimed and to discontinue support to these businesses 
as a consequence of these decisions and the resulting impact on the operations of amg and qualimed  we determined that there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of these investments 
as a result  we adjusted the carrying value of these investments to their net realizable value by writing off our equity investment in these two companies 
we will continue to sell peripheral stent products in europe through our subsidiary  intervascular  inc the cardiac assist direct sales operation in a european country was closed because it was unprofitable 
we will distribute our cardiac assist products through a distributor in this country 
the restructuring charge in the second quarter includes severance expenses for people  or of our worldwide employment 
substantially all of the terminated employees left the company effective december  the workforce reductions will not have any significant impact on our operations 
the restructuring programs are expected to provide annual cost savings of approximately million 
interest income interest income for fiscal was million compared to million last year 
the decline in interest income in fiscal was the result of a lower average portfolio balance from million to million and a decrease in the average yield from to 
other income during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain of thousand  or per share after tax  from the sale of an underutilized facility in oakland  new jersey 
income taxes in fiscal the tax rate was compared to for last year 
the tax rate in fiscal significantly increased due to expenses related to the restructuring programs in the first half of the year that were not deductible for tax purposes  primarily in international businesses 
the tax rate in both years was favorably impacted by the following o the tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation fsc and the extraterritorial income exclusion which replaced the fsc effective january  o income exempt from foreign corporate taxes resulting from the implementation of an alternative tax planning strategy in fiscal for an international manufacturing facility that was tax exempt until january  
excluding the restructuring charge in fiscal and the special gain in fiscal  the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to last year 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million or per diluted share last year 
excluding the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal and the special gain in fiscal  net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share last year 
the decreased earnings in fiscal were primarily attributable to o slower sales growth o a reduced gross margin percentage resulting primarily from reduced sales of higher margin products  and o increased sg a and r d expenses  as discussed above 
foreign currency due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the liabilities and transactions being hedged 
a portion of the net foreign transaction gain or loss is reported in our statement of consolidated earnings in cost of sales and the balance in other income and expense 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in european currencies 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million 
cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products increased to million 
sales of intra aortic balloon pumps increased as a result of strong customer demand for the system xt  our advanced performance balloon pump launched in the first quarter of fiscal sales of balloon catheters decreased while unit sales increased slightly 
the profile fr 
catheter continued its strong growth and market penetration  accounting for of worldwide balloon catheter unit sales compared to in fiscal patient monitoring patient monitoring sales rose to million driven by strong growth of the passport portable bedside monitor and accutorr plus noninvasive blood pressure monitor 
also contributing to growth were increased sales of masimo pulse oximetry sensors and new central station monitoring systems  which utilize recently introduced telemetry that operates across the full range of federal communications commission protected medical bands 
sales of the collagen products vascular grafts segment increased in fiscal to million 
collagen products sales of vasoseal arterial puncture sealing devices increased to million  which reflects a decline in us market share  due to intensified competition and slower than anticipated growth in productivity from our newly expanded field sales organization 
we expanded the field sales organization  comprised of sales representatives and clinical specialists  by in the second half of fiscal vascular grafts intervascular sales increased to million  reflecting continued international demand for intergard silver  the world s first anti microbial vascular graft  and a favorable comparison to the depressed prior year when our us distributor reduced inventory 
genisphere in fiscal  genisphere continued to successfully pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and sales reached million compared to million in fiscal investment spending for the development of the genisphere business was approximately million in fiscal the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to in fiscal  with the slight decrease primarily attributable to lower average selling prices for certain patient monitoring products 
research and development r d expenses remained unchanged at million in fiscal compared to fiscal  with increased development expenses for the vasoseal and cardiac assist product lines being offset by lower development expenses in the patient monitoring product line 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher selling and marketing expenses for the patient monitoring and cardiac assist product lines and the vasoseal field organization expansion  partially offset by lower corporate expenses

income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was for both fiscal and fiscal the tax rate in both years was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of o the tax benefit from the foreign sales corporation o income exempt from foreign corporate taxes resulting from a tax exemption for an international manufacturing facility until january   and the implementation of an alternative tax planning strategy in fiscal o interest income exempt from federal income taxes o net effect of research and development credits 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal excluding the special items recorded in fiscal and fiscal  net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal the increased earnings in fiscal was attributable to higher gross margin from increased sales and tight expense control 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a decrease in cash and short term investments million  partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities million

full conversion of all affected country operations to the euro currency was completed by the time national currencies were removed from circulation 
statement concerning forward looking information this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the possibility that market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the cardiac assist  vascular sealing and other markets served by the company  the company s dependence on certain suppliers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and vasoseal products and the company s ability to gain market acceptance for new products 
additional risks are the possibility that fda will not approve pma applications for new vasoseal products  the possibility that the new technique for vasoseal  mht  will not significantly bolster vasoseal s competitive position  the possibility that the company will not achieve success through direct selling of intervascular products in the us  the ability of the company to successfully introduce new products  continued demand for the company s products generally  rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in documents filed by datascope with the securities and exchange commission
