table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of from sales of million in fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased decreased by  and  respectively 
sales for both fiscal years reflect the company s adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
during fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sab  which resulted in a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of million after taxes 
under sab  the company has recorded deferred profit of million and million at september  and september   respectively 
deferred profit is comprised of deferred revenue related to systems that have been delivered but do not yet qualify for revenue recognition under sab  net of the related deferred cost of sales 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases decreases of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the increase in north america primarily resulted from an increase in scientific instruments sales 
this increase was partially offset by the sales decline in vacuum technologies 
the increase in europe was primarily driven by growth in scientific instruments sales 
the decrease in the rest of the world was primarily due to the decline of vacuum technologies sales into the pacific rim and  to a lesser degree  lower scientific instruments demand in latin america 
gross profit 
gross profit was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in gross profit percentage was driven primarily by higher electronics manufacturing gross profit margins as a result of improved operational efficiency in fiscal year and higher costs from integrating an acquisition and higher start up costs for new customers in fiscal year this increase in fiscal year was partially offset by a lower gross profit percentage for vacuum technologies  which was negatively impacted by lower sales to industrial capital equipment and semiconductor equipment customers  and a lower gross profit percentage for scientific instruments  due to proportionally higher revenues from nuclear magnetic resonance nmr systems  which had lower gross profit margins but similar operating profit margins compared to the overall segment 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the decline as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from increased scientific instruments sales  particularly high field nmr systems which typically generate lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales 
the decline is also attributable to programs undertaken in the second half of fiscal year to reduce sales and marketing costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year research and development expenses increased from fiscal year primarily because the company continued to increase its focus within the scientific instruments segment on new product development for life science applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year during fiscal year  general and administrative expenses included million in amortization of intangible assets  compared to million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year the decrease in amortization resulted primarily from the company s adoption at the beginning of fiscal year of financial accounting standards board the fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  eliminating the amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by new amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions made in the first half of fiscal year 
table of contents purchased in process research and development

in addition  the company recorded a one time charge of million for purchased in process research and development in the second fiscal quarter ended march  relating to several ansys products which were in process at the time of the acquisition 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense resulted primarily from lower interest rates on invested cash 
taxes on earnings 
the effective income tax rate was excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charge for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the fiscal year rate was lower than the fiscal year rate due mainly to reductions in tax rates in non us jurisdictions where the company has significant manufacturing operations 
net earnings 
net earnings were million net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year  compared to net earnings of million net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year prior to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle sab 
the improvement in net earnings resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
segments 
scientific instruments sales of million in fiscal year increased over fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales of nmr systems  certain products selling into life science applications which accounted for approximately of scientific instruments sales  compared to approximately in the prior year  and the ansys acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year excluding sales from this and other businesses acquired in fiscal year  sales in fiscal year increased by from fiscal year earnings from operations in fiscal year were million of sales 
excluding the purchased in process research and development charge  earnings from operations of million of sales increased from million of sales in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased sales of products targeted toward life science applications and revenues from after market products and services  all of which typically have higher operating margins 
during fiscal year  operating expenses for scientific instruments included million in amortization of intangible assets  compared to million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year the decrease in amortization resulted primarily from the company s adoption at the beginning of fiscal year of fas  eliminating the amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by new amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions made in the first half of fiscal year for fiscal year  high single digit sales growth is expected  with good growth in sales for life science applications and modest  if any  growth in sales for chemical analysis applications 
operating profit margins are expected to move toward as fiscal year progresses 
vacuum technologies sales of million in fiscal year decreased from fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue decrease was caused primarily by weak demand from semiconductor equipment and other industrial capital equipment manufacturers 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales were down from the million of sales in fiscal year the lower earnings were primarily the result of lower sales in fiscal year single digit growth in vacuum technologies sales is expected for fiscal year operating profit margins for fiscal year are expected to be in the mid teens 
electronics manufacturing sales in fiscal year of million decreased from fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue decrease from the prior year period was caused by weaker demand from communications and industrial customers  largely offset by increased sales to life science such as health care equipment companies which accounted for approximately of electronics manufacturing sales  compared to approximately in the prior year 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales increased from million of sales in fiscal year the higher earnings in fiscal year were due to improved operational efficiency in fiscal year and higher costs from integrating an acquisition and higher start up costs relating to new customers in fiscal year single digit growth in electronics manufacturing sales is expected for fiscal year operating profit margins for fiscal year are expected to be in the high single digits 

table of contents with respect to consolidated results for fiscal year  the company expects high single digit sales growth  with an operating profit percentage similar to fiscal year in addition  the company expects to incur restructuring expenses of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year as it realigns resources to focus even more on life science applications 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of from sales of million in fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased by   and  respectively 
sales of million reflect the company s adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sab  which resulted in a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of million after taxes 
also as a result of the adoption of sab  deferred profit totaling million was recorded as of september  the first day of fiscal year 
this amount was comprised of deferred revenue of million related to systems previously shipped and recorded as revenue but which did not qualify for revenue recognition under sab  net of the related deferred cost of sales of million 
the deferred profit balance was million at september  geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases decreases of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the increase in north america was due to sales growth in scientific instruments and electronics manufacturing  each of which grew  which was only partially offset by flat sales in vacuum technologies 
the almost flat sales in europe resulted mainly from the decline in the european currencies relative to the us dollar compared to fiscal year the increase in the rest of the world was primarily due to sales growth in scientific instruments 
gross profit 
gross profit was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the million increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the higher sales compared to fiscal year currency fluctuations contributed to lower gross profit percentages for scientific instruments but contributed to higher gross profit percentages for vacuum technologies compared to fiscal year electronics manufacturing had lower gross profit percentages in fiscal year primarily as a result of the costs of integrating an acquisition and start up costs for new customers 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the million increase was primarily to support the higher sales volume 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to research and development expenses of million representing of sales in fiscal year both scientific instruments and vacuum technologies increased research and development expenses as they increased their focus on new product development for life science applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in costs resulted primarily from increased goodwill amortization and other general and administrative costs of businesses acquired in fiscal years and net interest expense 
net interest expense was million representing of sales in fiscal year compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the reduction in net interest expense resulted mainly from income on invested cash and reduced expenses from lower borrowing levels 
taxes on earnings 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to without the in process research and development charge for fiscal year 
table of contents net earnings 
net earnings were million diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year  prior to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle sab  compared to net earnings of million diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year the net earnings improvement resulted primarily from higher sales partially offset by higher operating expenses 
segments 
scientific instruments sales of million in fiscal year increased over fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by demand for life science products in nmr  liquid chromatography  molecular spectroscopy  and dissolution  as well as for certain chemical analysis products  but was negatively impacted by the strong us dollar 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales decreased from million of sales in fiscal year the decrease in earnings from operations resulted primarily from the impact of sab had the company not adopted sab  sales would have been million and earnings from operations would have been million of sales 
vacuum technologies sales of million in fiscal year increased over fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by broad demand for research and life science applications partially offset by a continued slowing in demand for semiconductor applications 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales were up from million of sales in fiscal year the improved earnings resulted from the increased sales  improved product mix  and favorable impact of the stronger us dollar on the segment s turin  italy factory  which sold approximately of its output into the us electronics manufacturing sales in fiscal year of million increased over fiscal year sales of million 
electronics manufacturing experienced a slowing of demand from some of its communications customers  which was more than offset by demand from new life science such as medical device customers and customers brought to the business by the acquisition in october of the operations of imagine manufacturing solutions  inc earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales decreased from million of sales in fiscal year the decrease in earnings was primarily the result of the cost of integrating the acquisition and start up costs for new customers 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
following is a summary of what management considers to be the company s most critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied  and the judgments made in their application 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenues from three sources system sales  part sales  and service contracts 
generally  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product is delivered  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  sales returns have not been significant 
system sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  and that involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing hold back or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and recognized when the installation is complete 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements  such as accessories  is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
for certain other system sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is generally deferred until customer acceptance 
revenue related to part sales is recognized when the parts have been shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities 
management determines when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on its best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and its judgment of when the company s performance obligations have been met 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company sells its products and extends trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of the company s total revenues 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically not been significant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent management s best estimates and are based on management s judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  industry and market trends and conditions  and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  changes to inventory reserves might become necessary 
product warranty 
the company s products are generally subject to warranties  and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement in cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on management s best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in the company s warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully below under the heading risk factors environmental matters  under the terms of the distribution  the company and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by the company relating to these matters are based on management s best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries  or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from the company s current expectations and best estimates  changes to the company s reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year the increase in cash from operating activities resulted primarily from improved net earnings and improved working capital utilization 
the company used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year this increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to acquisitions completed during that period 
the company generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million used for financing activities in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company established a three year unsecured revolving bank credit facility in the amount of million for working capital purposes 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of september  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at rates of libor plus to depending on certain financial ratios of the company at the time of borrowing 
this credit facility contains certain customary covenants that limit future borrowings of the company and require the maintenance by the company of certain levels of financial performance 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants and requirements 

table of contents as of september   the company and its subsidiaries had million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities for working capital purposes with interest rates to be established at the time of borrowing 
no borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities as of september  all of these credit facilities contain certain conditions and events of default customary for such facilities  with which the company was in compliance 
of the million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities  a total of million was limited for use by or in favor of certain subsidiaries 
as of september   a total of million of these facilities was being utilized in the form of bank guarantees or short term standby letters of credit related to subsidiary activity 
no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these guarantees and letters of credit as of september   and separate liabilities were recorded in the consolidated financial statements at that date for advance payments or customer deposits 
as of september   the company had million in term loans outstanding compared to million at september  as of september  and september   fixed interest rates on the term loans ranged from to and to  respectively 
the weighted average interest rates on the term loans were at september  and september  the term loans contain certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating results 
for fiscal year  the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreements 
the company also had other long term notes payable of million as of september  with an interest rate of and million as of september  with an interest rate of future principal payments on long term debt outstanding on september  were million  million  million  million  million  and million during fiscal years      and thereafter  respectively 
the distribution agreement provides that the company is responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party  and further provides that the company will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses  and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former  and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see below under the heading risk factors environmental matters 
in connection with certain acquisitions  the company has accrued but not yet paid certain purchase price amounts which have been held back to secure the sellers indemnification obligations 
these holdback amounts  which are due to be paid at various times through fiscal year net of any indemnification claims  totaled approximately million at september  in addition to the holdback payments  the company is also obligated to pay additional cash purchase price amounts in the event that contingent financial or operational milestones are met by the acquired businesses 
as of september   up to a maximum of million could be payable through fiscal year under these contingent consideration arrangements 
any contingent payments made will be recorded as additional goodwill at the time they are earned 
the company s liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes future principal payments on outstanding long term debt and minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases as of september  fiscal years thereafter total in thousands long term debt including current portion operating leases total contractual cash obligations in addition to the above  the company had cancelable commitments to purchase certain superconducting magnets intended for use with leading edge nmr systems totaling approximately million  net of deposits paid  as of september  in the event that these commitments are canceled for reasons other than the supplier s default  the company would be responsible for reimbursement of actual costs incurred by the supplier 
as of september   the company did not have any off balance sheet commercial commitments that could result in a significant cash outflow upon the occurrence of some contingent event  except for contingent payments of up to a maximum of million related to acquisitions as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  the specific timing and amounts of which are not currently determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fas  business combinations  and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively and provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets 
fas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
fas is effective for all business combinations completed after june  under fas  goodwill must be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
upon adoption of fas  amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  must cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the new criteria for recognition as intangibles under fas must be reclassified to goodwill 
adoption of fas was required for the company s fiscal year the company elected to early adopt the provisions of fas on the first day of fiscal year september  
in accordance with fas  the company ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value totaling million as of that date  including certain intangible assets previously classified as purchased intangible assets 
in connection with the adoption of fas  the company performed a transitional impairment test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in august  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for the company s fiscal year fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas applies to all entities 
the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
while fas carries forward many of the provisions of fas and apb  some of the key differences in the new standard are that goodwill is excluded from its scope  assets to be abandoned will be viewed as held for use and amortized over their remaining service period  and the standard broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
fas is effective for the company s fiscal year the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which is effective for transactions occurring after may  fas rescinds fas and fas  which addressed the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
fas set forth industry specific transitional guidance that did not apply to the company 
fas amends fas to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
fas also makes technical corrections to certain existing pronouncements that are not substantive in nature 
the adoption of fas in the third quarter of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of fas includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors customer demand 
demand for the company s products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in the case of our scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments  we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements  and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services  and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market  and sell these products  and protect our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely effected 
in the case of the company s electronics manufacturing segment  we must respond quickly to our customers changing requirements 
customers may change  delay  or cancel orders for many reasons  including lack of success of their products or business strategies and economic conditions in the markets they serve 
in addition  some customers  including start up companies  have limited product histories and financial resources  which make them riskier customers for us 
we must determine  based on our judgment and our customers estimates of their future requirements  what levels of business we will accept  what start up costs to incur for new customers or products  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs  and other resource requirements 
all of these decisions require predictions about the future and judgments that could be wrong 
cancellations  reductions  or delays in orders by a significant customer or group of customers  or their inability to meet financial commitments with respect to orders or shipments  could have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
variability of operating results 
the company experiences some cyclical patterns in sales of its products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december and many customers defer december deliveries until the next calendar year  our second fiscal quarter 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including general economic conditions  acquisitions  and new product introductions 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents for most of the company s products  we operate on a short backlog  as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
we also experience significant shipments in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how our customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 
certain of our leading edge nmr systems  probes  and components together accounting for less than of the company s revenues and operating profits sell for high prices and on long lead times 
these systems and components are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving leading edge research applications  often have customer specific features  custom capabilities  and specific acceptance criteria  and  in the case of nmr systems  require superconducting magnets that can be difficult to manufacture 
these superconducting magnets are not manufactured by us  so our ability to ship  install and obtain customer acceptance of our leading edge nmr systems is dependent upon the superconducting magnet supplier s timely development  delivery and installation of magnets that perform to customer specifications 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast shipment  installation and acceptance of leading edge nmr systems and probes  which in turn can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the achieved gross profit margin on these systems 
competition 
the industries in which the company operates scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing are highly competitive 
in each of these industries  we compete against many us and non us companies  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  compete on price  or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales  or managerial activities 
others have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than the company 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
additionally  in the case of electronics manufacturing  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally  there is substantial excess manufacturing capacity in the industry  certain competitors manufacture or are seeking to manufacture outside the us where there can be significant cost advantages  and certain customers may be willing to move to off shore manufacturing for cost reasons  larger competitors might have greater direct buying power from suppliers  and electronics manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant intellectual property protection 
for all of the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins  and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers 
some items purchased by the company for the manufacture of its products  including superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
the loss of a key supplier or the inability to obtain certain key raw materials or components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increase our costs  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced and could again experience delivery delays in superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  which has and could again cause delays in our product shipments 
in addition  end users of our nmr systems require helium to operate those systems  shortages of helium could result in higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for nmr systems  which could impact demand for those systems 
the company s electronics manufacturing segment uses electronic components in the manufacture of its products 
these components can be more or less difficult and expensive to obtain  depending on the overall demand for these components as a result of general economic cycles or other factors 
consequently  the electronics manufacturing segment s results of operations may fluctuate over time 
business interruption 
the company s facilities  operations  and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to the limited 
table of contents availability  broad exclusions  and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments  and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s employees based in certain foreign countries are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
of these  the company s employees in australia are subject to a collective bargaining agreement that will need to be renewed in april a work stoppage  strike  or other labor action at this or other facilities of the company could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
the company s success depends on its intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements  and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property  and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
third parties might claim that the company infringes their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we also might be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing  or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to avoid these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
failure to protect against these risks could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
the company has acquired companies and operations  and intends to acquire companies and operations in the future  as part of its growth strategy 
acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies  and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
foreign operations and currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of the company s sales  manufacturing activities  and employees are outside of the united states 
as a result  the company is subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs  and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers  or profit repatriations  import  export  and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
additionally  the us dollar value of the company s net sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations  although the company s manufacturing operations in other countries often act as a natural hedge against the profitability impact of currency exchange fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
these risks could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
the company s success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales  and management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 

table of contents in addition  certain employees have significant institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
the company s operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state  and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of the company s operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that the company s compliance with these regulations will have a material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at nine sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment  or disposal 
in addition  vms is overseeing and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation activities under the direction of  or in consultation with  foreign  federal  state  and or local agencies at certain current vms or former vai facilities 
under the terms of the distribution  the company and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of these environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of september   it was nonetheless estimated that the company s share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and the company therefore accrued million as of september  as to other sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and costs of future environmental related activities 
as of september   it was estimated that the company s share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of september  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental related cost than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  these amounts totaled million at september  the company therefore accrued million as of september   which represents the best estimate of its share of these future environmental related costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 

table of contents at september   the company s reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by the company as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities are being undertaken 
an insurance company agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs for which the company has an indemnity obligation  and the company therefore has a million receivable in other assets as of september  for the company s share of such recovery 
the company has not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
we believe that the company s reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of its obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges or credits against earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to the company s financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  we believe that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
governmental regulations 
the company s businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition  and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines and other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation  and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the company typically hedges its foreign currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies and with certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows 
the success of the company s hedging activities depends on its ability to forecast transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  any such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
as a result  the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
at september   forward contracts to sell japanese yen having an aggregate notional value of million were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sale transactions 
these contracts were deemed to be highly effective  and as a result  a loss of million net of tax on these contracts is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
a summary of all forward exchange contracts that were outstanding as of september  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands euro australian dollar japanese yen canadian dollar british pound swedish krona total interest rate risk the company has no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company invests any excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at september   the company s debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amounts of long term debt and notes payable approximate their estimated fair values 
although payments under certain of the company s operating leases for its facilities are tied to market indices  the company is not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with its operating leases
