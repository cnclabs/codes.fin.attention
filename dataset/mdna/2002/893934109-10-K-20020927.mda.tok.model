item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to transmontaigne inc that are based on beliefs and assumptions made by us as well as information currently available to us 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
should one or mores of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company does not intend to update these forward looking statements except as required by law 
general the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
material period to period variances in the consolidated statements of operations are discussed under results of operations 
the liquidity and capital resources section analyzes cash flows and financial position 
transmontaigne inc transmontaigne was formed in to create an independent refined petroleum products merchant based in denver  colorado 
we are a holding company that conducts our commercial activities primarily in the mid continent  gulf coast  southeast  mid atlantic and northeast regions of the united states 
we supply  distribute  transport  store  and market refined petroleum products  chemicals  crude oil  and other bulk liquids collectively referred to as products to refiners  distributors  marketers  and industrial commercial end users 
our commercial activities currently are divided into two main areas i product supply  distribution  and marketing services  and ii terminal and pipeline operations 
our product supply  distribution and marketing operations generally utilize our terminal and pipeline infrastructure to market and trade various products and provide specialized supply  logistical  and risk management services to our customers 
product supply  distribution  and marketing operations we seek to maintain a balanced position of forward sale commitments against our discretionary inventories and forward purchase commitments  thereby minimizing or eliminating exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes and the open positions in energy services and risk management contracts 
however  there are certain risks that we do not attempt to hedge or eliminate 
for example  we attempt to exploit the price relationships between various delivery locations referred to as basis geographical location differentials 
these differentials create opportunities for increased operating margins when we predict the most beneficial location highest value location for sales of our discretionary inventories of refined products 
however  the margins created from exploiting these market inefficiencies do not occur ratably over our reporting periods 
our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations typically purchase products at prevailing prices from refiners and producers at production points and common trading locations 
when we purchase products  we simultaneously sell the products for physical delivery to third party users or by entering into future delivery obligations  such as  futures contracts on the nymex 
these futures contracts minimize or eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in the quoted price of the commodity  but do not minimize exposure to basis geographical location differentials 
these products are then shipped via barge  pipelines we own  or third party owned pipelines to terminals we own or to third party terminal locations 
from these terminal locations  the products are made available to our customers either through contract sales  exchange agreements or daily priced rack sales 

table of contents rack sales 
we manage the physical quantity of our discretionary inventories of product through daily priced rack sales 
on a daily basis we establish the selling price for each product for each of our delivery locations terminals 
we announce or post those selling prices to independent local jobbers via facsimile  website  email  and telephone communications 
our selling price of a particular product on a particular day is a function of our supply at that delivery location terminal and our estimate of the costs to replenish the product at that delivery location 
the demand for a particular product is sensitive to changes in pricing 
if our objective is to increase demand for a particular product at a specific delivery location  we would post the selling price of that product at the low end of the range of prices being offered in that location to increase our local demand 
if our objective is to decrease demand for a particular product at a specified delivery location  we would post a selling price at the high end of the range of prices being offered in that location to reduce our local demand 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under daily priced rack sales 
exchanges 
exchange agreements are entered into with major oil companies and independent refiners 
these agreements provide for the exchange of product at one delivery location for product at a different location 
we generally receive a fee based on the volume of the product exchanged 
that fee takes into account the cost of transportation from the receipt location to the exchange delivery location 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under exchange agreements 
bulk and cycle sales 
bulk and cycle sales of products are entered into with major oil companies and independent refiners 
these transactions involve the sale of products in large quantities in liquid bulk markets pasadena  tx  new york harbor  chicago  il  tulsa  ok refining area  and los angeles  ca 
these transactions also involve the sale of products in large quantities prior to scheduled delivery to us by producers and refiners for transportation by pipelines  barges  vessels  or rail cars to our terminals 
these transactions may occur while the products are in transit prior to reaching our terminals 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under bulk and cycle sales 
contract sales 
contract sales of products are conducted from our own and third party terminal  storage  and delivery locations with independent local jobbers  industrial commercial end users  and governmental agencies 
contract sales provide these customers with a specified volume of product over a specified term at a specified price 
the terms of these contracts range from as short as one month to terms that span up to three years 
the pricing of the product delivered under a contract sale may be fixed at a stipulated price per gallon or it may vary based on changes in published indices eg  opis and platts 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under contract sales 
energy services 
we provide supply chain management services to our industrial commercial end users downstream of the truck loading rack location 
fuel and risk management logistical services provide our large and small volume customers an assured  cost effective delivered source of products supply through our pipelines and terminals  as well as through third party pipeline  terminal  truck  rail and barge distribution channels 
customers of our supply chain management services receive the benefits of our web based technology systems enabling the customers to minimize their total product costs while meeting their volumetric needs 
we generally receive a fee based on the volume of the products we originate for the customer in exchange for providing our supply chain management services 
our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations include energy trading and risk management activities as defined by emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
in accordance with eitf  our energy trading and risk management activities are marked to market ie  recorded at fair value in the accompanying 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet 
the mark to market method of accounting requires that the effect of changes in the fair value of our energy trading and risk management activities be recognized as assets and liabilities and included in net revenues attributable to product supply  distribution  and marketing in the period of the change in value 
the consensus on eitf previously permitted revenues from energy trading and risk management activities to be presented on the face of the statement of operations on either a gross or net basis 
we previously elected to present revenues from our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations on a gross basis with a separate line item entitled product costs in the costs and expenses section of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
product costs represent the cost of the products sold  settlement of risk management contracts  transportation  storage  terminaling costs  and commissions 
at its june meeting  the eitf amended its consensus on eitf to require that revenues from energy trading and risk management activities be reported on a net basis ie  product costs are required to be netted directly against gross revenues to arrive at net revenues 
that amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after july  nevertheless  we have chosen to adopt early that amended guidance for all periods presented 
therefore  for the year ended june  and all prior periods  we have presented revenues from our product supply  distribution and marketing operation on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net earnings loss have not been affected by this change in presentation 
net revenues attributable to our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations are as follows in thousands years ended june  gross revenues less cost of revenues net revenues our energy trading and risk management activities include our inventories discretionary volumes  energy services contracts  and risk management contracts 
our inventories discretionary volumes are held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business and consist of refined petroleum products  primarily gasoline and distillates 
our energy services contracts require us to deliver physical quantities of products over specified terms at specified prices 
our risk management contracts eg  forward sales contracts  forward purchase contracts  and swaps minimize our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
we enter into risk management contracts with the objective of offsetting the changes in the values of our inventories discretionary volumes and energy services contracts 
it is our policy not to acquire products  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on the flat price associated with the underlying commodity 
risk management policies have been established by our risk management committee to monitor and control these price risks 
our risk management committee is comprised of our senior executives 
our inventories discretionary volumes are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our energy services and risk management contracts also are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our energy services and risk management contracts are presented as unrealized gains or losses on energy services and risk management contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
terminals and pipelines we own and operate a terminal infrastructure that handles products with transportation connections via pipelines  barges  rail cars and trucks to our facilities and to third party facilities 
as of june   we owned and operated the following facilities delivery locations terminals with approximately million barrels of tank space capacity along the colonial and plantation pipeline systems  delivery locations terminals with 
table of contents approximately  barrels of tank space capacity along the explorer williams pipeline systems  delivery locations terminals with approximately million barrels of tank capacity along the florida coast  delivery location terminal with approximately million barrels of tank capacity in brownsville  texas  and delivery locations terminals with approximately million barrels of tank capacity along the mississippi and ohio rivers 
we own an interstate products pipeline operating from mt 
vernon  missouri to rogers  arkansas the razorback pipeline  together with associated terminal facilities at mt 
vernon and rogers 
the razorback pipeline is the only products pipeline providing transportation services to northwest arkansas 
effective june   we acquired for cash consideration of approximately million the remaining interest in the razorback pipeline system that we did not previously own 
we also own and operate a small intrastate crude oil gathering pipeline system  located in east texas the cetex pipeline 
the success of our terminal and pipeline operations depends in large part on the level of demand for products by end users in the geographic locations served by such facilities and the ability and willingness of our customers to supply such demand by utilizing our terminals and pipelines as opposed to the terminals and pipelines of other companies 
at our terminals and pipelines  we provide throughput  storage  and transportation related services to distributors  marketers and industrial commercial end users of products 
throughput revenues 
terminal throughput fees are based on the volume of products handled at the facility s truck loading racks  generally at a standard rate per gallon 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of throughput volumes at our terminals 
storage revenues 
terminal storage fees generally are based on a per barrel rate or tank space capacity committed and will vary with the duration of the arrangement  the product stored and special handling requirements  particularly when certain types of chemicals and other bulk liquids are involved 
transportation revenues 
pipeline transportation fees are based on the volume of products transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point 
for the years ended june  and  we averaged approximately  and  barrels per day  respectively  of transported volumes through our pipelines 
the direct operating costs and expenses of the terminals and pipelines operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits  utilities  communications  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  rent  vehicle expenses  environmental compliance costs  materials and supplies 
we cannot predict the impact of future fuel conservation measures  alternate fuel requirements  governmental regulation  technological advances in fuel economy  demographic changes  weather conditions  crop prices  and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce the demand for products in the areas we serve 
natural gas services we previously provided selected natural gas services including the gathering  processing  fractionating  and marketing of natural gas liquids and natural gas 
we discontinued this activity when we sold it effective december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
natural gas gathering and processing revenues were based on the inlet volume of natural gas purchased from producers under both percentage of proceeds and fee based arrangements 
natural gas was gathered and processed into ngl products  principally propane  butane and natural gasoline and residue natural gas 
these products were transported by truck or pipeline to storage facilities from which they were further transported and marketed to wholesalers and end users 
residue natural gas was delivered to and marketed through connections with third party interstate natural gas pipelines 
operating expenses of the natural gas processing activity include the directly related wages and employee benefits  utilities  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  rent  insurance  vehicle expenses  environmental compliance costs  materials and supplies 

table of contents critical accounting estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment  and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents the amount of trade receivables that we do not expect to collect 
the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our analysis of specific individual customer balances that are past due and  from that analysis we estimate the amount of the receivable balance that we do not expect to collect 
that estimate is based on various factors  including our experience in collecting past due amounts from the customer being evaluated  customer s current financial condition  the current economic environment and the economic outlook for the future 
inventories discretionary volumes 
at june   we held products for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business with a value of million 
our inventories discretionary volumes are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the valuation of our inventories discretionary volumes is based on quoted prices  when available 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all future periods and delivery locations in which we are committed to do business 
when quoted prices are not available  we estimate the values based on historical relationships between current and future prices and delivery locations 
energy services contracts 
at june   we were a party to energy services contracts that require us to deliver physical quantities of refined petroleum products over a specified term at a specified price 
our energy services contracts are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
at june   our net unrealized gains on energy services contracts were approximately million 
the valuation of our energy services contracts is based on quoted prices  when available 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all future periods and delivery locations in which we are committed to do business 
when quoted prices are not available  we estimate the values based on historical relationships between current and future prices and delivery locations 
accrued lease abandonment 
at june   we have an accrued liability of million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay  net of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our to be vacated office space in denver  colorado and atlanta  georgia 
the valuation of our accrued lease abandonment is based on the timing and amount of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our to be vacated office space 
our estimate of the timing and amount of sublease payments is based on information received from real estate brokers 
accrued transportation and deficiency agreements 
at june   we have an accrued liability of million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for the estimated shortfall in volumes for the remainder of the terms of our transportation and deficiency agreements 
the valuation of our accrued transportation and deficiency agreements is based on our estimate of the future volumes we expect to supply and ship with the counterparties to these agreements 
we estimate the future volumes based on our historical volumes supplied and shipped with the counterparties 
our accrued liability would be adjusted if our current projections of future volumes to be supplied and shipped with the counterparties indicated a significant increase or decrease in expected volumes due to changes in the scope and breadth of our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations 

table of contents accrued environmental obligations 
at june   we have an accrued liability of million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
the valuation of our accrued environmental obligations is based on our estimate of the remediation costs to be incurred in the future 
we estimate the future remediation costs based on specific site studies using enacted laws and regulations 
estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation  technology changes affecting remediation methods  alternative remediation methods and strategies  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
at june   the carrying amount of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock was million 
the carrying amount is based on our estimate of the fair value of the series b redeemable preferred stock at the date of issuance june  
we estimated the value of the series b redeemable preferred stock by adding together i the present value of the expected dividend payments and mandatory redemption value discounted at a risk adjusted rate and ii the value of the embedded conversion option using an option pricing model 
significant developments during the year ended june   we amended and restated our bank credit facility new facility to provide us with financing to expand our petroleum products marketing and terminaling network  support our working capital requirements and general corporate needs  recapitalize our preferred stock  and repurchase shares of our common stock 
the new facility provides us with a revolving line of credit and the ability to issue letters of credit to support our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations 
we also announced our decision to relocate our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations from roswell  georgia to denver  colorado to join our corporate headquarters 
extension of bank credit facility on june   we entered into the new facility with a syndication of banks 
the new facility provides for a maximum borrowing under the revolving line of credit that is the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is a function of our accounts receivable  inventory  exchanges  margin deposits  open positions of energy services and risk management contracts  outstanding letters of credit  and outstanding indebtedness as defined in the new facility 
borrowings under the new facility bear interest at our option based on the lender s base rate plus a specified margin  or libor plus a specified margin  the specified margins are a function of our leverage ratio as defined in the new facility 
borrowings under the new facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the new facility matures on june  the terms of the new facility include financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage  current ratio  maximum leverage ratio  consolidated tangible net worth  capital expenditures  cash distributions and open inventory positions that are tested on a quarterly and annual basis 
at june   we were in compliance with all covenants included in the new facility 
preferred stock recapitalization on june   we entered into an agreement with the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock recapitalization agreement to redeem a portion of the outstanding series a convertible preferred stock and warrants in exchange for cash  shares of common stock  and shares of a newly created and designated preferred stock series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock recapitalization agreement resulted in the redemption of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in exchange for the i issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock with a fair value of approximately 
table of contents million  ii issuance of  shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million  and iii a cash payment of approximately million 
the fair value of the consideration paid to the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock was in excess of the financial statement carrying amount of the series a convertible preferred stock that was redeemed 
that excess of approximately million has been treated in a manner similar to preferred stock dividends in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at june   there were  shares of series a convertible preferred stock that remain outstanding 
in connection with the preferred stock recapitalization agreement  we also agreed to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock from an institutional holder of the series a convertible preferred stock for cash consideration of approximately million 
we borrowed approximately million under the new facility to finance the redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock and the reacquisition of the common stock

ultimately  employees chose to relocate to denver  colorado 
those employees are entitled to receive a transition bonus and a relocation package payable upon transfer to the denver office 
the transition bonus is being accrued over the period from date of acceptance by the employee to the expected date of arrival in denver  colorado 
the relocation costs are being accrued as incurred earned by the employee 
ultimately  employees chose not to relocate and those employees are entitled to receive termination benefits on their termination date as determined by us 
the special termination benefits were accrued upon receipt of the notification from the employee that they did not intend to accept the offer to relocate to denver  colorado

we believe that  in addition to cash flow from operating activities and net earnings loss  ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing operating performance since it provides an additional basis to evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
in evaluating ebitda  we believe that consideration should be given  among other things  to the amount by which ebitda exceeds interest costs for the period  how ebitda compares to principal repayments on debt for the period  and how ebitda compares to capital expenditures for the period 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda  such as net revenue and direct operating expenses  and the variability of such components over time  also should be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our method of calculating ebitda may differ from methods used by other companies and  as a result  ebitda measures disclosed herein might not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda plus lower of cost or market write downs on our inventories minimum volumes 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is the most useful measure in evaluating our performance because it eliminates the impact on operating results from the impairment of our inventories minimum volumes

product supply  distribution and marketing our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations include energy trading and risk management activities as defined by emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
in accordance with eitf  our energy trading and risk management activities are marked to market ie  recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the mark to market method of accounting requires that the effect of changes in the fair value of our energy trading and risk management activities be recognized as assets and liabilities and included in net revenues attributable to product supply  distribution  and marketing in the period of the change in value 
we seek to maintain a balanced position of forward sale commitments against our discretionary inventories and forward purchase commitments  thereby minimizing or eliminating exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes and the open positions in energy services and risk management contracts 
however  there are certain risks that we do not attempt to hedge or eliminate 
for example  we attempt to exploit the price relationships between various delivery locations referred to as basis geographical location differentials 
these differentials create opportunities for increased operating margins when we predict the most beneficial location highest value location for sales of our discretionary inventories of refined products 
however  the margins created from exploiting these market inefficiencies do not occur ratably over our reporting periods 
during a contango or carry market structure  we utilize our and third party terminals to store products to capture commodity price differentials between current and future months 
mark to market accounting will create volatility in our net operating margins due to either the widening or narrowing of these pricing spreads from the original spread relationship 
if the spreads widen narrow  marking these storage volumes and the related forward contracts to market will produce unrealized losses gains in interim reporting periods 
these negative positive results will reverse and the originally anticipated spread will be recognized during the future periods when the physical product inventory is delivered against the short future position 
at june   we held approximately million barrels of distillates in our terminals for future delivery 
the net operating margins reported for the product supply  distribution and marketing operations include amounts realized on product sales  exchanges and arbitrage 
the net revenues from our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  the increase of million in net revenues is due principally to taking advantage of market opportunities that were caused by volatility in basis geographical location differentials 
during the quarter ended september   a disruption at a chicago refinery resulted in increased volatility in basis geographical location differentials 
this disruption increased the basis geographical location differentials for both gasoline and distillates between the gulf coast  chicago and group mid continent regions  which created significant margin opportunities in arbitraging the basis geographical location differentials between those markets 
during the quarter ended march   we were able to increase our net operating margins by taking advantage of the price volatility in the gasoline market in the gulf coast region 
that volatility also created significant arbitrage opportunities associated with basis geographical 
table of contents location differentials 
in addition  during the quarter ended march   we renegotiated and extended for an additional year  a fixed price supply contract with a large industrial commercial end user 
we recognized approximately million in net revenues associated with this contract extension and we deferred approximately million for the value of the supply chain management services that we are committed to provide over the term of the supply contract 
during the quarter ended june   we experienced a reduction in volatility in basis geographical location differentials combined with an unfavorable relationship between crude oil and refined product prices 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized impairment losses of approximately million and million  respectively  due to lower of cost or market write downs on the minimum inventory volumes 
these write downs are included in net operating margins attributable to our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations 
terminals and pipelines the net operating margins from our terminal and pipeline operations for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in net operating margins was due principally to the sale of our little rock facilities on june  and the norco system on july  for the year ended june   the net operating margins from the little rock facilities and the norco system were million 
our pipeline net operating margins per barrel of transported volumes were approximately and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in net operating margins per barrel is due principally to the higher unit tariff being realized on one of our joint tariffs  as compared to the lower unit tariff associated with our norco system which was disposed of in july selling  general  and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase of million was due principally to increased compensation and travel expenses related to our corporate relocation and transition during the year ended june  depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to the disposition of the norco system and little rock facilities 
we recognized special charges of million during the year ended june  related to the corporate relocation and transition 
we expect to recognize an additional special charge of million during the year ended june  to complete the corporate relocation and transition 
the additional special charges will consist of million in moving costs for employees relocating to denver  colorado  transition benefits of million payable to employees relocating to denver  colorado  and moving costs of million related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters 
other income and expenses dividend income and equity in earnings from petroleum related investments for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in dividend income was due principally to the decline in dividends received from west shore 
we sold our investment in west shore on october  interest income for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in interest 
table of contents bearing cash balances and lower interest rates during the year ended june  pursuant to our cash management practices  excess cash balances are used to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and commodity margin loan 
interest expense for the year ended june  was million  compared to million during the year ended june  for the year ended june   our interest expense resulted from million for outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and senior notes  million for outstanding letters of credit  million for outstanding borrowings under our commodity margin loan  and million in net payments for the interest rate swap 
the decrease of million in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of debt outstanding during the current year 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the little rock facilities  norco system  and west shore to repay our outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and commodity margin loan 
we also benefited from lower interest rates during the year ended june   as the average interest rate under our bank credit facility was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
other financing costs for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in other financing costs was due principally to a reduction in the amortization of deferred financing costs of million and a lower unrealized loss on the interest rate swap of million 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap was million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively 
the swap agreement provides that we pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of million in exchange for receiving a variable rate based on libor so long as the one month libor interest rate does not rise above 
if the one month libor rate rises above  the swap knocks out and we will receive no payments under the agreement until such time as the one month libor rate declines below 
at june  and  the one month libor rate was and  respectively 
this swap agreement expires in august gain loss on the disposition of assets for the year ended june  consists of loss on the sale of west shore  million gain on the sale of the norco system  million gain on the sale of our investment in st oil company  and loss on the sale of other assets 
gain on the disposition of assets was million for the year ended june  due to the sale of the little rock facilities

income tax expense was million for the year ended june   which represents an effective combined federal and state income tax rate of 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock were million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year dividend resulted from our election to pay the preferred dividends in kind by issuing additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
the fair value of the consideration paid to the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock to affect the preferred stock recapitalization was in excess of the financial statement carrying amount of the series a convertible preferred stock that was redeemed 
that excess of approximately million has been treated in a manner similar to preferred stock dividends in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  we reported net earnings of million for the year ended june   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  after preferred stock dividends  the net earnings attributable to common stockholders was million for the year ended june   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended june  were based on million weighted average common shares outstanding and million weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended june  were based on million weighted average common shares outstanding 
the increase in net earnings resulted primarily from the absence of an impairment charge in the year ended june   compared to a pre tax million impairment charge in fiscal  increased net operating margins from the product supply  distribution and marketing operations  offset by the net operating margins from the natural gas services activities which were sold  decreased selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to the sale of the natural gas services activities  and decreased interest expense  attributable to a decrease in average interest rates for the current year  a reduction in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from the sale of the natural gas services activities  and a reduction in the amount of discretionary inventory being carried by us during the current year 
product supply  distribution and marketing the net revenues reported for the product supply  distribution and marketing operations include amounts realized on product sales  exchanges and arbitrage transactions 
during the year ended june   we benefited from the following items increased supply disruptions in the gasoline and distillate markets  concerns regarding the availability of distillate for the northeastern region of the united states  the completion of our baton rouge dock facility which allowed us to arbitrage basis geographical location differentials between colonial pipeline supplied barrels and mississippi river based barrels  and an overall increase in the demand for products from customers supplied by us 
in the prior year  we experienced losses from liquidating a portion of our discretionary inventory position and an unfavorable impact from an abnormal price movement between crude oil and distillates 
subsequently  we amended our risk management policies to reduce the potential exposure from future abnormal commodity price movements of this nature by establishing daily reporting of our cumulative profit and loss positions to various levels of management  each of which has predetermined limits that escalate with the applicable level of authority 
our products inventory consists primarily of gasoline and distillates  the majority of which is held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business 
a portion of this inventory  based on line fill and tank bottoms  is required to be held for operating balances in the conduct of our daily product supply  distribution and marketing operations  and is maintained both in tanks and pipelines owned by us and pipelines owned by third parties 
during the quarter ended june   we embarked upon a thorough review of our inventory management strategies and customer contracts 
as a result  we lowered our required minimum inventory from over million barrels to the current level of million barrels 
we also changed our strategy regarding the risk management associated with this minimum inventory 
previously  we were hedging the minimum inventory in the futures market and we were renewing the hedges forward at the end of each month as the prior month s hedging contracts expired 
in connection with our new risk management strategy  we removed the hedging contracts on our minimum inventory  thereby eliminating any future cash receipts or payments associated with rolling the hedging contracts on the inventory that was not being sold 
during the year ended june   we experienced a cash loss of million associated with rolling the hedges into a backwardated market a market in which the current month commodity price is higher than the future price in succeeding periods with respect to the minimum inventory 
no loss of this type was realized in the year ended june  due to the change in the strategy associated with hedging the minimum inventory 
the new policy has resulted in recording the minimum inventories at the lower of cost or market with the resulting non cash write downs recognized in net operating margins 
we recognized a lower of cost or market write down of million during the year ended june  relating to our minimum inventories 

table of contents terminals and pipelines the net operating margins from our terminal and pipeline operations for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase of million in net operating margins is mostly attributable to increased utilization of our terminals during the current year which was offset somewhat by lower utilization of our pipeline systems 
the total revenues recognized by our terminal and pipeline operations increased by approximately million during the year ended the increase in net operating margins resulting from the increases in revenues was offset by an increase of approximately million in operating expenses during the year ended june  in the year ended june   we recognized a loss of approximately million for the write off of a few small terminal customers receivable balances 
natural gas services our natural gas services activities were divested effective december  selling  general  and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in selling  general  and administrative expenses is due principally to lease contract cancellation costs  additional personnel related costs related to separation and release agreements  non cash stock compensation costs  and other personnel costs related to a corporate staff reduction and relocation plan  all of which amounted to approximately million during the year ended june  that were not incurred during the current year 
the sale of our natural gas services activities resulted in a reduction of approximately million of employee costs in the current year 
during the year ended june   travel and entertainment expenses decreased by approximately million  and employee wage and benefit expenses decreased by approximately million 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to the disposition of our natural gas services activities 
non cash impairment charges on long lived assets for the fiscal year ended june  totaled million  before income taxes 
the charges include million relating to certain of our product terminals acquired in the acquisition of louis dreyfus energy corp 
and million relating to certain intangible assets recorded as a result of the same acquisition 
the impairment charges resulted from the change in the planned use of certain terminals and the abandonment of a pipeline that supplied one terminal  thereby significantly impacting the economic viability of the terminals 
each of these events significantly reduced or eliminated future cash flows related to these assets 
the million impairment charge for the terminals reduced the book value of the assets to their estimated fair value 
the additional million impairment charge for the intangible assets represented the unamortized balance of the intangible assets 
our review of the market location differentials associated with those assets showed that we received little or no value from those assets in the period ended june  there were no impairment charges on long lived assets for the year ended june  other income and expenses dividend income and equity in earnings from petroleum related investments for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase of million in dividend income was due principally to dividends being received from west shore and lion oil in the year ended june   compared to the prior year in which dividends were received only from west shore 
additionally  we recorded million of equity earnings in the year ended june  from our investment in st oil company 

table of contents interest income for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in interest bearing cash balances and lower interest rates during the year ended june interest expense for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of debt outstanding during the current year resulting from the sale of our natural gas services activities and the liquidation of our discretionary inventory in the prior year 
we also benefited by an overall reduction in our borrowing rate under our bank credit facility due to declining libor rates 
other financing costs for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june  the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap was million for the year ended june  in the year ended june   the unrealized gain on the interest rate swap was million 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap was due to a decline in the one month libor rates during the year ended june gain on the disposition of assets was for the year ended june   primarily due to the sale of the little rock facilities 
gain on the disposition of assets was million for the year ended june  and was primarily due to the sale of our natural gas services activities  partially offset by losses on the disposition and retirement of other assets no longer used in our operations 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended june   which represents an effective combined federal and state income tax rate of 
income tax benefit was million for the year ended june   which represents an effective combined federal and state income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended june  due to an adjustment in cumulative temporary differences recognized in the fiscal year ended june preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock were million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year dividend resulted from our election to pay the preferred dividends for the quarters ended march and june  in kind by issuing additional shares of series a convertible preferred stock 

table of contents financial position at june   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million  compared to million at june  the increase of in working capital is due principally to increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories discretionary volumes of million  net of amounts due under exchange agreements  being offset by decreases in the current portion of net unrealized gains on energy trading and risk management contracts of million and increases in accounts payable of million and excise taxes payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable of million is due principally to an increase in the volume of daily priced rack sales  which are billed on a gross basis  compared to exchange transactions  which are billed on a net basis  and an increase in product supply  distribution  and marketing volumes coupled with a corresponding increase in the price of gasoline 
our gross revenues for the product supply  distribution  and marketing operations were approximately million for the month ended june   compared to approximately million for the month ended june  our inventories discretionary volumes are held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business and consist of products  primarily gasolines and distillates 
our inventories discretionary volumes are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as current assets and are carried at fair value 
inventories discretionary volumes are as follows in thousands june  june  amount bbls amount bbls products held for sale or exchange products due to others under exchange agreements  net inventories discretionary volumes during the last six months of the year ended june   we increased our discretionary inventory of distillates to capitalize on the carry or contango market structure 
during a contango market  we utilize our and third party terminals to store products to capture commodity price differentials between current and future months 
at june   we held approximately million barrels of distillates in our terminals for future delivery 
our inventories discretionary volumes are an integral component of our overall energy trading and risk management activities 
we evaluate the level of inventories discretionary volumes in combination with energy trading and risk management disciplines  including certain hedging strategies  forward purchases and sales  swaps and other financial instruments to manage market exposure  primarily commodity price risk 
we evaluate the market exposure from an overall portfolio basis that considers both continuous movement of physical inventory balances and related open positions in energy trading and risk management contracts 
our inventories minimum volumes are required to be held for operating balances in the conduct of our overall operating activities 
we do not intend to sell or exchange these inventories in the ordinary course of business and  therefore  we do not hedge the market risks associated with this minimum inventory

table of contents during the years ended june  and  we recognized impairment losses of approximately million and million  respectively  due to lower of cost or market write downs on this minimum inventory 
these write downs are included in net operating margins attributable to our product supply  distribution  and marketing operations 
at june  and  the weighted average adjusted cost basis of our inventories minimum volumes was and per gallon  respectively 
during the three months ended june   we conducted a thorough review of our inventory management strategies and customer contracts 
effective july   we designated million barrels of refined petroleum products as inventories minimum volumes and we changed our risk management strategy associated with this minimum inventory 
in accordance with our revised risk management strategy  we removed the hedging contracts on the minimum inventory volumes prior to july  relative month end commodity prices from june  to june  nymex close on the last day of the month are as follows crude heating oil gasoline the following table indicates the maturities of our energy services and risk management contracts  including the credit quality of our counter parties to those contracts with unrealized gains at june  fair value of contracts in thousands maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total unrealized gain position asset energy services contracts investment grade non investment grade no external rating risk management contracts nymex futures contracts unrealized loss position liability energy services contracts risk management contracts nymex futures contracts net unrealized gain position asset

a single industrial commercial end user represented approximately million of that unrealized gain 
at june   we also had energy services contracts with that end user that were in an unrealized loss position of approximately million 
therefore  the fair value of our energy services contracts with that industrial commercial end user was approximately million at june  the following table includes information about the changes in the fair value of our energy services contracts with that industrial commercial end user for the year ended june  in thousands fair value at june  amounts realized or otherwise settled during the year fair value of additional contracts entered into during the year change in fair value attributable to change in commodity prices other changes in fair value fair value at june  approximately million was included in net revenues attributable to the product supply  distribution and marketing activities and approximately million was deferred for supply chain management services to be provided over the term of the contract see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not acquire or sell products  futures contracts  or other financial instruments solely for the purpose of speculating on changes in commodity prices 
our risk management committee reviews the discretionary inventory and related open positions in energy services and risk management contracts on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance with our inventory and risk management policies 
we have adopted policies under which changes to our net risk position  which is subject to commodity price risk  requires the prior approval of our audit committee of the board of directors 
our inventories discretionary volumes  energy services contracts  and risk management contracts are the integral components of our overall energy trading and risk management activities 
we evaluate our market risk exposure from an overall portfolio basis that considers changes in physical inventories discretionary volumes  open positions in energy services contracts  and open positions in risk management contracts 
we have established risk management policies and procedures to monitor and control our market risk exposure 
our overall risk management objective is to minimize our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
we accomplish this objective by entering into risk management contracts that offset the changes in the values of our inventories discretionary volumes and energy services contracts when there are changes in commodity prices 
at june   our open positions in risk management contracts include forward contracts purchases and sales  swaps  and other financial instruments to manage market exposure  primarily commodity price risk 
we principally utilize exchange traded risk management contracts to manage our commodity price risk 
these contracts require us to maintain initial and variation margin deposits with a third party financial intermediary 
at june   we had million on deposit to cover our margin requirements on open risk management contracts  which consisted solely of an initial margin deposit 
at june   a per gallon unfavorable change in commodity prices would have required us to deposit approximately million in variation margin 
conversely  a per gallon favorable change in commodity prices would have permitted us to reduce the deposit in our margin account by approximately million 
we have the contractual right to request that the counterparties to our energy services contracts post additional letters of credit or make additional cash deposits with us to assist us in meeting our obligations to cover our margin requirements 
capital expenditures for the year ended june  were million for terminal and pipeline facilities and assets to support these facilities 
future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability  economics and cost of appropriate acquisitions which we identify and evaluate  the economics  cost and required regulatory approvals with respect to the expansion and enhancement of existing systems and facilities  customer demand for the services we provide  local  state and federal governmental regulations  
table of contents environmental compliance requirements  and the availability of debt financing and equity capital on acceptable terms 
on june   we executed the new facility with a syndication of banks 
the new facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit that is the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is a function of our accounts receivable  inventory  exchanges  margin deposits  open positions of energy services and risk management contracts  outstanding letters of credit  and outstanding indebtedness as defined in the new facility 
borrowings under the new facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the new facility matures on june  the terms of the new facility include financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage  current ratio  maximum leverage ratio  consolidated tangible net worth  capital expenditures  cash distributions and open inventory positions that are tested on a quarterly and annual basis 
as of june   we were in compliance with all covenants included in the new facility 
at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the new facility 
we also had the ability to borrow an additional million under the new facility based on the borrowing base computation at june  we have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash 
the amounts of our contractual obligations are as follows in thousands years ending june  thereafter debt preferred stock transportation and deficiency agreements operating leases new corporate headquarters existing corporate headquarters excluding estimated sublease rentals property and equipment total contractual obligations to be settled in cash see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have outstanding letters of credit with third parties in the amount of million which expire within one year 
we believe that our current working capital position  future cash expected to be provided by operating activities  available borrowing capacity under our new facility and commodity margin loan  and our relationship with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable us to meet our planned capital and liquidity requirements 
cash flows net cash used by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended june  was due principally to increases in accounts receivable and inventories discretionary volumes 
the net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended june  was due principally to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories discretionary volumes  offset by an increase in net assets from price risk management activities and a decrease in trade accounts payable and inventory due under exchange agreements

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  and establishes that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and we will adopt sfas no

to have an impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective july  to accomplish this  we must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require us to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  we will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
we currently are in the process of assessing the impact  if any  on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of adopting sfas no 
however  we are unable to estimate the impact of adopting this statement at the date of this report 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
also provides guidance that will eliminate inconsistencies in accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets under existing accounting pronouncements 
the new rule retains many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions provided for in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale

in periods subsequent to initial measurement  changes to the liability shall be measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the liability initially 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in connection with our corporate relocation and transition  we accrued our expected lease abandonment costs and severance costs 
it would appear that sfas no 
would not permit the accrual of those expected costs in advance of those costs being incurred 
had sfas no 
been in effect for the year ended june   we believe that approximately million of accrued lease abandonment costs and approximately million of accrued severance benefits would not have been recognized at june  
table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk risk policies we are exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
we have no foreign currency exchange risks 
risk management policies have been established by our risk management committee rmc to monitor and control these market risks 
our rmc is comprised primarily of senior executives 
our rmc has responsibility for oversight with respect to all product risk management policies and our audit committee approves the financial exposure limits 
commodity risk our earnings  cash flow and liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors beyond our control  including the supply of  and demand for products 
demand for products depends on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation 
as a result  products experience price volatility  which directly impacts our revenues and net operating margins 
our net operating margins are not impacted as much by the absolute price of the commodities as they are by the impact that the absolute price has upon supply and demand and the related movement of products 
we have developed risk management strategies to mitigate the risk associated with price volatility on our product inventories 
we believe these strategies are integral to our risk policies since product inventories are required to effectively operate our product supply  distribution and marketing operations and such inventories are expected to be purchased  sold and carried over extended periods of time in the ordinary course of business 
we mitigate exposure to commodity price fluctuations by maintaining a balanced position of future commitments for product purchases and sales  either in the physical commodity market or the derivative commodity markets 
our strategies are intended to minimize the impact of product prices volatility on profitability and generally involve the purchase and sale of exchange traded  energy futures and options 
to a lesser extent  we enter into energy swap agreements  such as crack spreads  when they better match specific price movements in our markets 
these strategies are designed to minimize  on a short term basis  our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in product margins 
the barrels of products covered by such contracts vary and are closely managed and subject to internally established risk guidelines 
in connection with our products supply  distribution and marketing operations  we engage in price risk management activities 
our price risk management activities are energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
as such  the financial instruments utilized are marked to market in accordance with the guidance set forth in eitf under the mark to market method of accounting  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with third parties are reflected at market value  net of future physical delivery related costs  and are shown as unrealized gain or loss on energy services and risk management contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses from newly originated contracts  contract restructurings and the impact of price movements are included in net revenues 
changes in the assets and liabilities from price risk management activities result primarily from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  newly initiated transactions and the timing of settlement relative to the receipt of cash for certain contracts 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimate considering various factors  including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the commitments 
the values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
for certain of our energy services contracts and contract locations  calculating fair value relies on a degree of estimation in calculating the basis geographical location differentials for deferred trading months and locations without an actively traded forward cash market 
for these markets in which we cannot secure a 
table of contents forward traded basis geographical location differential quote from a broker  our mark to market model estimates the basis geographical location differentials based on a rolling historical average 
currently  it is not practicable for us to estimate the effects on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows from an unfavorable change in basis geographical location differentials 
contractual commitments are subject to risks relating to market value fluctuations  as well as counterparty credit and liquidity risk 
we have established procedures to continually monitor these contracts in order to minimize credit risk  including the establishment and review of credit limits  margin requirements  master net out arrangements  letters of credit and other guarantees 
interest rate risk at june   we had outstanding million under the new facility 
we are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the variable rate debt associated with the new facility 
the interest rate is based on the lender s alternate base rate plus a spread  or libor plus a spread  in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bi monthly  quarterly or semi annually 
based on the outstanding balance of our variable interest rate debt at june   our interest rate swap  and assuming market interest rates increase or decrease basis points  the potential annual increase or decrease in interest expense is approximately million 
in august  we entered into two periodic knock out swap agreements with money center banks to offset the exposure of an increase in variable interest rates on our debt 
each swap was for a notional value of million and was for a term expiring in august the swaps settle monthly  contain a knockout level on the one month libor at or above  and have a fixed interest rate of
