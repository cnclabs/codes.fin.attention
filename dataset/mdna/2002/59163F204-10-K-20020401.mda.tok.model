item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all statements and trend analyses contained in this item and elsewhere in this report on form k relative to the future constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to the business and economic risks faced by us  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
for a discussion of such risks  see issues and uncertainties 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
results of operations for the periods discussed below should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as changes in the telecommunications market  the addition or expiration of customer contracts  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  lengthy sales cycles  lack of market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new versions of our products or features  the timing of the initiation of wireless services or their acceptance in new market areas by telecommunications customers  the timing and expense of the expansion of our national call center network  the general employment environment  general economic conditions and the other factors discussed under the heading issues and uncertainties in this item overview we are a leading developer and provider of enhanced directory assistance and information services for the telecommunications industry 
we primarily contract with wireless carriers to provide these services to their subscribers 
under our contracts  the carriers agree to route some or all of their directory assistance and or alphanumeric messaging calls to us 
we also offer our services to multiple carriers within the same market 
when a carrier s subscribers dial a typical directory assistance number  such as  or  the calls are answered by our operators identifying the service by that carrier s brand name  such as at t connect  or sprint pcs directory assistance 
each carrier establishes its own directory assistance fee structure for its subscribers 
wireless subscribers typically pay fees ranging from to plus airtime charges for our services 
we bear no subscriber collection risk 
we charge our carriers directly on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
in order to encourage our customers to route more of their calls to us  our long term strategy has been based in part on reducing the price we charge our customers 
our average revenue per call decreased in as call volume increased 
we expect a decrease in average revenue per call to continue in  although at a lower rate than that of prior years  as we believe this reduced pricing better positions us to retain and expand service with existing carrier customers  to attract new wireless and landline carriers  and to achieve greater operating margins over time 
in  we expect to continue our call center and network expansion to prepare for anticipated growth 
this growth is expected to come from existing customers in the form of new markets acquired  as well as from increased usage within geographic markets currently being served 
we will also continue to opportunistically pursue additional significant new business 
our call center and network expansion efforts will increase our local service coverage and our capacity to process additional call volume 
our growth plan involves both capital expenditures and operating expenses  as we build infrastructure and recruit and train qualified personnel 
to better serve our customers and strengthen our relationships  we attempt to match the operating readiness of our call centers to the timing of when our customers transition call volume to us 
at times  our customers have experienced delays  and may experience some additional delays in the future  in the timing of delivery of call volume to us 
these delays can increase our ongoing operating expenses with no corresponding increase in revenues 
the result under these conditions has been  and will likely continue to be  near term reported earnings that vary widely 
however  we intend to continue to pursue and prepare for significant additional call volume in order to seek to achieve greater earnings over the long run 
results of operations the following table shows selected items of our statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues direct operating expenses general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense interest and loan fees income before income taxes income tax expense net income call centers in operation at year end compared to revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in we have offered volume discount pricing for the last several years in order to encourage customers to send additional call volume to us 
as an ongoing result of this pricing policy  as well as numerous other factors including the quality of our services  call volume has continued to increase each year 
call volume grew to approximately million calls in from approximately million calls in this increase resulted from growth in call volume under existing contracts and markets  as well as new call volume from new contracts and new markets 
our average revenue per call was approximately in compared to in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses consist of call center personnel and listings data and content acquisition costs 
these expenses increased  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the costs of servicing increased call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses decreased to in from in  due primarily to operating efficiencies realized from greater call volumes and lower costs of accessing information content 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from additional costs necessary to support our larger base of call centers and increased call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease resulted primarily from efficiencies associated with the growth of our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by to million in from million in  due primarily to equipment purchased for new call centers  for upgrades and expansions of existing call centers  product development activities and amortization related to business acquisition 
other income expense

other expense for the year ended december  consisted primarily of losses on the disposition of assets of  and other miscellaneous non operating expenses of  offset by interest income of  the increase in interest income resulted primarily from increases in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of common stock to sonera media holding bv see significant events 
interest expense and loan fees 
interest expense and loan fees decreased  to  in from million in this decrease resulted from a decrease in average debt outstanding during the year 
all debt was paid in full as of march  income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million for an effective tax rate of approximately 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was  for an effective tax rate of approximately 
these rates differ from the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately due primarily to the use of net operating loss carryforwards and the use of various federal and state tax credits 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in call volume grew to approximately million calls in from approximately million calls in this increase resulted from growth in call volume under existing contracts and markets  as well as new call volume from new contracts and new markets 
our average revenue per call was approximately in compared to in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses consist of call center personnel and listings data and content acquisition costs 
these expenses increased  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the costs of servicing increased call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses increased to in from in  due primarily to the reduction in the average revenue per call 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from costs associated with the start up of new call centers and the investment in infrastructure necessary to support additional call volume and the increase in depreciation expense associated with additional call centers 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease resulted primarily from efficiencies associated with the expansion of our operations 
depreciation and amortization

income tax expense for the year ended december  was  for an effective tax rate of approximately 
december  was  for an effective tax rate of approximately 
these rates differ from the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately due primarily to the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost which approximates their fair market value 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to approximately million at december  the net increase of million resulted primarily from the investment by sonera and cash generated from operations offset by the payment of debt and cash paid in business acquisition 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million 
all debt was paid in full as of march  working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to working capital provided by the investment by sonera and from working capital generated from operations  offset by the use of working capital for capital expenditures  the repayment of debt and cash paid in business acquisition 
cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  resulting primarily from net income  the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting primarily from net income  the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable 
cash flow from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively and was related primarily to capital expenditures for the purchase of equipment for new call centers  the upgrade and expansion of existing call centers  upgrades and expansions of corporate networks and infrastructure and  in  cash paid in the acquisition of a data extraction and processing company as discussed below in significant events 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  resulting primarily from the proceeds of the investment by sonera and the receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the repayment of all outstanding debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in  resulting primarily from borrowings under credit facilities and the receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the repayment of debt obligations future capital needs and resources 
the primary uses of our capital in the near future are expected to be the development or acquisition of technologies  features and content complementary to our business and to expand our call center and network capacity to serve existing and potential new customers and for general corporate purposes  including possible acquisitions and other corporate development activities and working capital 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately to million in  resulting primarily from projected call center expansions  increased network capacity and corporate development activities 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
commitments 
we generally lease our facilities through non cancelable operating leases extending for up to ten years 
annual payments on non cancelable operating lease commitments are detailed in note of the financial statements 
from time to time  in the normal course of our business  we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   we had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of  related to our workers compensation program 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit for the same amount 
this commitment expires on april  and is typically renewed on an annual basis 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these commitments are not reflected in our balance sheets 
significant events in february  we completed a transaction with sonera media holding b 
v 
sonera  a wholly owned subsidiary of sonera corporation of helsinki  finland  whereby sonera purchased six million newly issued shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate price of million and an approximate ownership position at that time 
sonera develops and provides mobile value added services 
a portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used to pay off all outstanding debt 
in february  we acquired enthusiasm technologies  inc  a seattle based developer of web based data extraction and processing technology which has become our content development department  for a combination of cash and stock 
this group builds application specific databases for a variety of portals  be they wired or wireless  voice or data 
our proprietary data extraction and processing technology enables the creation and ongoing maintenance of high quality databases from distributed and fragmented data on the web and elsewhere 
we believe that these capabilities will contribute to the expansion of our services and data offerings to our wireless and other customers 
the purchase price in this transaction was not material to our financial position 
significant accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements  those governing accounts receivable and the lives and recoverability of the carrying amount of equipment and other long lived assets  such as existing intangibles  internally developed software and goodwill  may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation and uncertainty 
our customer base consists of mostly very large wireless telephone carriers in the united states 
as such  management believes we have minimal risk of uncollectibility  at any point in time  related to outstanding accounts receivable 
we have not experienced significant collection issues or write offs related to these customers  consequently  we do not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could adversely impact collection of our accounts receivable and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including patents and trademarks and internally developed software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
at such time  we estimate the future cash flows expected upon eventual disposition and  if lower than the carrying amount  adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
purchased goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination  was amortized on a straight line basis  over the estimated economic life  through december  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the statement discontinues the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
the statement is effective for all business combinations occurring after june  we believe the impact of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new standard  goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life will no longer be amortized 
however  goodwill and other intangible assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
 and  other than cessation of amortization of goodwill  we believe the impact of adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the amount of amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives was  in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement are effective with fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and replaces sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and accounting principals bulletin no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of business 
we believe the impact of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position or results or operations 
effect of inflation inflation did not materially affect our business during the last several years 
issues and uncertainties while management is optimistic about our long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook 
our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly in part due to factors outside our control 
in the future  as in the past  our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly as a result of a number of factors 
we cannot control many of these factors  which include  among others changes in the telecommunications market  including the addition or withdrawal of carriers from the market  changes in technology and increased competition from existing and new competitors  the timing of the commencement of our services under new or existing contracts with our carrier customers  which depends in part on the customers ability to adapt their networks and billing systems to allow them to transfer calls to us  the timing and expense of our call center network expansion  including increased staffing and infrastructure expenses related to anticipated new call volume  the addition or expiration of contracts with carrier customers  changes in our or our competitors  customers or suppliers pricing policies  lengthy sales cycles for new and extended contracts  lack of market acceptance or delays or increased development costs related to the introduction of our services or features  and general economic conditions 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as an indication of any future results 
our future operating results could fall below the expectations of securities industry analysts or investors 
any such shortfall could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
fluctuations in our operating results would likely increase the volatility of our common stock price 
the rapidly changing telecommunications market could unfavorably affect us 
the telecommunications market is subject to rapid change and uncertainty that may result in competitive situations which could unfavorably affect us 
these changes and uncertainties are due to  among other factors mergers  acquisitions and alliances among carriers and among our competitors  which can result in fewer carriers in the marketplace  lost carrier customers  increased negotiating leverage for newly affiliated carriers and more effective competitors  changes in the regulatory environment  which may affect us directly  by affecting our ability to access and update listings data at a reasonable cost  or indirectly  by restricting our carrier customers ability to operate or provide a competitive service  increasing availability of alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and other information services  including the internet  and evolving industry standards  including frequent technological changes and new product introductions 
we have contracts with a limited number of carrier customers 
if we fail to extend or renew these contracts  or if these contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
a limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues 
for example  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues in our two largest customers  sprint pcs and at t wireless services accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively  in our business would be adversely affected by the loss of either sprint pcs or at t wireless services and could be adversely affected by the loss of any other significant customer 
of our contracts with significant customers  two expire in  including sprint pcs 
the remainder  including at t wireless services and nextel communications  expire in and beyond 
some contracts contain performance and other standards and may be terminated prior to their scheduled expiration dates under specified circumstances 
if we fail to extend or replace our contracts  or our contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
although we seek to increase the number of our customers  and maintain good relationships with our existing customers  a small number of companies dominate the telecommunications market 
this limits the potential customer base and our expansion opportunities 
we have a long sales cycle which may cause delays that adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
a customer s decision to contract for our directory assistance and information services involves a significant commitment of technical and other resources 
as a result  we have a long sales cycle for both new and extended contracts  particularly with large customers 
the selling process involves demonstrating the value added benefits of outsourcing directory assistance and using our services rather than those of our competitors 
any delays due to lengthy sales cycles could significantly affect our revenue growth and operating results 
our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to accurately estimate the amount and timing of call volume 
the actual amount and timing of call volume is often subject to factors outside of our control 
our operating results are significantly affected by costs incurred for staffing and expanding infrastructure 
we incur significant staffing and general and administrative costs in anticipation of call volume under our customer contracts 
if such call volume does not arrive as scheduled  in the amount anticipated  or at all  our operating results can be adversely affected 
this could increase our operating expenses without a corresponding increase in revenues from the anticipated call volume 
we face substantial competition from a number of other companies 
many of our competitors in the directory assistance market  including the regional bell operating companies  have far greater resources and better name recognition 
the regional bell operating companies also may have the advantage of being the local telephone carrier in their area of operation 
some of these companies are or may be developing their own versions of enhanced directory assistance services 
we also face competition from a number of other independent directory assistance providers 
if we are unable to compete successfully  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and appropriately respond to many factors  including the introduction of new services and products by our competitors  changes in subscriber preferences  changes in economic conditions and discount pricing strategies by our competitors 
our inability to achieve desired pricing levels could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
we are subject to competitive pressures with respect to pricing  which could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
the prices that we charge our carrier customers are subject to the terms of our contracts 
the changing telecommunications market  the relative leverage of the negotiating parties and the overall competitive landscape can significantly impact contract pricing negotiations 
we charge our carriers on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
our long term strategy is based in part on reducing the price we charge our customers 
generally  our pricing levels have declined and  in the future  will likely continue to decline as call volumes increase 
if we were to substantially reduce our prices without correspondingly increasing volume  there could be an adverse impact on our ability to operate profitably 
we are dependent on the wireless telecommunications industry  and a decrease in wireless usage by subscribers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
almost all of our revenues come from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to our wireless customers subscribers 
a decrease in wireless usage in general  or of our products in particular  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
wireless usage by subscribers appears to be affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including pricing  safety concerns  reliability and availability of the wireless network  government regulation and reliability and availability of alternative technologies 
we need to expand call volume and increase efficiencies in order to be successful 
in order to successfully execute our business strategies  we need to increase the volume of calls made to our call center network  while realizing the benefits of operating leverage 
we intend to increase call volume by seeking additional customers  including landline carrier customers  as well as seeking additional business from our existing customers 
we have limited experience in the landline market  which is dominated by the regional bell operating companies 
if we are unable to expand our wireless business or attract significant landline business  on a cost effective basis or at all  we may be unable to increase profitability or sustain past growth rates 
if we are unable to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop new services and features  we may not succeed 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new services and features that are accepted by the marketplace and cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings 
the development of new services and features can be very expensive 
further  given rapid technological changes  frequent introduction of new products  services and features  and changing consumer demands that characterize our industry  it can be difficult to correctly anticipate future changes in technology and industry standards 
if we fail to develop new services and features  encounter difficulties that delay the introduction of such services and features  or incorrectly anticipate future changes and develop services and features that are not accepted by the marketplace or are not cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings  we may not succeed at our business 
alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and information services could reduce the demand for our services 
our business comes primarily from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to telephone users 
however  information can be transmitted in other ways  including more intelligent communications devices and other technologies and protocols  and over the internet 
for example  as the internet continues to develop and becomes easier to use and access  technologies may be developed that decrease or eliminate the demand for telephone based or voice based directory or information services 
widespread acceptance of existing and developing technologies and protocols  such as voice recognition and wireless application protocol  could adversely affect our business 
our call volume could decline if telephone users change their usage habits and rely on the internet or other alternatives as their primary source for information 
systems failures  delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business  cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability 
our success also depends on our ability to provide reliable services 
our operations could be interrupted by significant damage to or failure of our network  our connections to third parties  our computer hardware or software or our customers or suppliers computer hardware or software 
any such significant damage or failure could disrupt the operations of our network and the provision of our services and result in the loss of current and potential customers 
in addition  as call volume increases  we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software in order to provide services 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may make it difficult for us to expand and upgrade our systems in a timely and economical manner 
if we are unable to obtain or adequately update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service or improve our service 
our operations depend on our access to the names  telephone numbers and other information that we supply directly to callers or we use in providing our services 
the availability  cost  quality and usefulness of such data varies widely across geographic regions 
if we are unable to obtain or update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service  improve our enhanced directory assistance service or provide new services and features 
ultimately  the satisfaction of our carrier customers  and our ability to renew and extend our current customer contracts and enter into new customer contracts  depends on the quality of services we provide to the carrier s subscribers 
the quality of our services is directly related to the quality of our listings data and other information content 
as we rely on a limited number of suppliers  an abrupt loss of any key supplier could adversely affect our business operations or delay our development efforts 
we rely on some key suppliers to provide us with programming and engineering services and to license us their technology 
an abrupt loss of any current key supplier could cause a disruption in our operations or a delay in our development efforts  including the planned expansion of our call center network  and could adversely affect our business operations 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel and call center operators  or our call center staff is unionized  our operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  technical personnel and call center operators 
the loss of the services of our senior management and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our strategic objectives 
we also depend on the continued service of our call center operators  who we hire from the available labor pool 
as we continue to expand our call center network  the ability to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel  operators and other skilled employees is extremely important to the operation of our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals  or we are required to pay significantly higher wages and other benefits to such individuals  or if our call center staff is unionized  it could adversely affect our business operations 
we find it more difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals during periods of low unemployment and  therefore  may be subject to increasing pressure to offer higher wages and other benefits during such periods 
in our call center hiring  we may also feel the effects of the telecommunications industry in general  which has widespread union membership among its operators and other workers 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
we regard aspects of our enhanced directory assistance and information services and their features and processes to be proprietary 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
to a limited extent  we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property 
however  these measures may be difficult and costly to meaningfully enforce 
in addition  attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights may bring into question the validity of these rights 
litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights can result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources 
future acquisitions may strain our operations 
we intend to evaluate  and in the future may pursue  acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy 
if we fail to adequately address financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions  future acquisitions may adversely harm our business 
these risks can include  among other things difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  information systems and personnel of the acquired company  including the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls and policies  and the loss of key employees of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  impairment of relationships with licensors  customers and suppliers  difficulties in entering into markets in which we have no direct prior experience  use of cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and significant write offs and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we expand our business into international markets  we will encounter risks which could adversely affect us 
we currently operate only in the united states  however  an element of our business strategy is to continue to explore international business opportunities 
if we expand into one or more international markets  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things our ability to attract sufficient business or locate a suitable partner or joint venture candidate to enable us to overcome logistical and economic barriers to entry  our ability and cost to gather sufficient information content and listings data  properly modify our features and services to meet applicable standards  and hire and train personnel  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and political  regulatory and economic developments and cultural differences 
regulations affecting our customers and suppliers and future regulations to which we may be subject may adversely affect our business 
although we are not directly subject to telecommunications industry regulation  the business of our customers and certain suppliers is subject to regulation that indirectly affects our business 
we cannot predict when  or upon what terms and conditions  further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect of regulation or deregulation on our business 
we may need additional capital in the future  and it may not be available on acceptable terms 
we may require more capital in the future to fund our operations  finance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain and expand our call center and network capabilities  enhance and expand the range of services and features we offer  and respond to competitive pressures and potential opportunities  such as investments  acquisitions and international expansion 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to reduce our operations or abandon expansion opportunities 
our common stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to a number of factors 
these factors include  among others announcements of extensions  expirations or changes in our contracts and the opening of new call centers to support such activity  announcements relating to material events concerning our customers  actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  obsolescence of technologies that we or our customers use  introductions of new technologies  and general market conditions 
from january  through december   our common stock price fluctuated from per share to per share and has on several days fluctuated more than 
similar market fluctuations have affected the market prices of equity securities of many telecommunications companies and other public companies generally 
these trading prices and valuations may change significantly and arbitrarily 
in addition  broad market factors affecting telecommunications or technology stocks may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions  including interest rate changes and recession  may also adversely affect our stock price 
our results of operations could be impacted by a significant increase in the rate of inflation 
inflation has not historically had a material affect on our business 
operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures which could adversely affect our operating results 
oregon law and provisions of our charter could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  and the board of directors has the authority to fix the preferences  limitations and relative rights of those shares without any vote or action by the shareholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
in addition  provisions under oregon law limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over our company 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of our company through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors and may deter efforts to obtain control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are invested in money market instruments  and therefore  the fair market value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  substantially all of our investments at december  were invested in overnight money market instruments and were redeemable on a daily basis 
all of the underlying investments in the money market fund had maturities of three months or less 
as a result  we believe the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
in addition  we may be exposed to interest rate risk primarily through use of short term and long term borrowings to finance operations 
a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
