this section provides supplemental information which should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the financial review is divided into three subsections entitled earnings analysis  financial condition  and liquidity and capital resources 
information therein should facilitate a better understanding of the major factors and trends which affect the company s earnings performance and financial condition  and how the company s performance during compares with prior years 
throughout this section  capital city bank group  inc  and its subsidiaries  collectively  are referred to as ccbg or the company 
capital city bank is referred to as ccb or the bank 
the year to date averages used in this report are based on daily balances for each respective year 
in certain circumstances  comparing average balances for the fourth quarters of consecutive years may be more meaningful than simply analyzing year to date averages 
therefore  where appropriate  quarterly averages have been presented for analysis and have been noted as such 
see table for annual averages and table for financial information presented on a quarterly basis 
on march   the company completed its second purchase and assumption transaction with first union national bank first union and acquired six of first union s offices in georgia which included real estate  loans and deposits 
the transaction resulted in approximately million in intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  which is being amortized over a year period

at the time of the acquisition  first national bank of west point had million in assets with one office in west point  georgia  and two offices in the greater valley area of alabama 
first bankshares of west point  inc  merged with ccbg  and first national bank of west point merged with ccb 
the company issued shares and in cash for each of the  shares of first bankshares of west point  inc  resulting in the issuance of  ccbg shares and paid consideration of approximately million

these intangible assets are being amortized over a year period 
on may   the company completed its acquisition of grady holding company and its subsidiary  first national bank of grady county fnbgc in cairo  georgia 
at the time of the acquisition  fnbgc had million in assets with offices in cairo and whigham  georgia 
the company issued shares for each of the  shares of fnbgc 
grady holding company was merged with ccbg  and fnbgc became a second bank subsidiary for ccbg 
the consolidated financial statements of the company give effect to the merger which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  financial statements for the prior periods have been restated to reflect the results of operations of these entities on a combined basis from the earliest period presented 
on november   the merger of fnbgc with ccb was completed  and ccb became the resulting bank and only bank subsidiary of ccbg 
the company is headquartered in tallahassee and  as of december   had offices covering counties in florida  four counties in georgia and one county in alabama

a further discussion of the company s operating costs can be found in the section entitled noninterest expense 
partially offsetting the higher expense level was an increase in operating revenues of million  or  over  driven by growth in earning assets and fee income 
this and other factors are discussed throughout the financial review

changes which are not solely due to volume changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes 
interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate to adjust interest on tax exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis 
in addition to growth  higher levels of liquidity and rapidly declining interest rates also significantly impacted the company s net interest margin 
for the year  the company experienced an unfavorable rate variance of million 
liquidity generated by the georgia acquisitions made the company s balance sheet more susceptible to interest rate movements over the short term 
see section entitled liquidity and capital resources for discussion of georgia acquisitions and liquidity 
management aggressively restructured rates on interest bearing liabilities to combat margin compression created by the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the funds rate during as a result  the company produced a favorable rate variance in the fourth quarter and the net interest margin increased from in the second quarter of to in the fourth quarter 
for the year  taxable equivalent interest income increased million  or  over  compared to an increase of million  or  in over the company s taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets of represents a basis point decrease from  compared to a basis point increase in over during  interest income was positively impacted by the growth and acquisition of earning assets  but adversely affected by lower yields as rates declined throughout the year 
the loan portfolio  which is the largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  increased from in the fourth quarter of  to in the comparable quarter of  which helped to buffer the decrease in yield attributable to falling rates 
interest income on funds sold increased reflecting the higher liquidity levels resulting from the recent georgia acquisitions and growth in existing markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from investment securities as maturities were not being reinvested in the securities portfolio due to the current interest rate environment and in anticipation of future loan demand 
interest expense increased million  or  over  compared to an increase of million  or  in over the higher level of interest expense in is attributable to the recent georgia acquisitions million in new deposits and growth in established markets 
the dramatic reduction in interest rates during had a very favorable impact on the company s overall cost of funds  which fell basis points year over year comparing fourth quarter to fourth quarter produces a basis point reduction in the cost of funds 
partially offsetting the favorable impact of lower rates was a slight shift in mix as certificates of deposit  which generally represent a higher cost deposit product to the company  increased from of average deposits in to in the company s interest rate spread defined as the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points in and increased basis points in the decrease in is attributable to the lower earning asset yields as discussed above 
the increase in was attributable to the change in earning asset mix and higher interest rates 
the company s net interest margin defined as taxable equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets was in  compared to in and in in  the higher level of liquidity and the rapid decline in interest rates resulted in an basis point decrease in the margin 
due to the declining interest rate environment in  the company anticipates continued lower yields on earning assets and lower rates on interest bearing liabilities 
given the current rate environment  the company s net interest margin is expected to improve in the first quarter of a further discussion of the company s earning assets and funding sources can be found in the section entitled financial condition 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in the provision primarily reflects the company s loan growth 
while still at historically low levels  the company continued to experience slight deterioration in the credit quality of its consumer loan portfolio

in at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million compared to million in at year end  the allowance represented of total loans 
management considers the allowance to be adequate based on the current level of nonperforming loans and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
see the section entitled financial condition and tables and for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses 
selected loss coverage ratios are presented below provision for loan losses as a multiple of net charge offs x x x pre tax income plus provision for loan losses as a multiple of net charge offs x x x noninterest income in  noninterest income increased million  or  and represented of taxable equivalent operating revenue  compared to  or  and  respectively  in the increase in the level of noninterest income is attributable to all categories except data processing revenues 
the increase in was primarily attributable to asset management fees and other income  partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts and data processing revenues 
factors affecting noninterest income are discussed below 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in  compared to a decrease of  or  in service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  the level of activity subject to service charges and the collection rate 
the increase in reflects the increase in the number of accounts  primarily as a result of the georgia acquisitions 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to higher compensating balances and a decline in the number of service chargeable accounts 
data processing revenues decreased  or  in versus a decrease of  or  in the data processing center provides computer services to both financial and non financial clients in north florida and south georgia 
the decrease in was primarily a result of a decline in revenues for financial clients 
the company currently processes for five financial clients  a decline from the prior year level of six 
in  processing revenues for non financial entities represented approximately of the total processing revenues  compared to in the decrease in total processing revenues for was primarily a result of a decline in revenues for non financial clients 
in  asset management fees increased  or  compared to  or in increases in both years were attributable to growth in assets under management 
at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or 
this growth was attributable to the generation of new accounts in existing markets and managed assets acquired through the georgia acquisitions 
the decline in stock market values over the past couple of years has offset a significant portion of the incremental revenues attributable to new business development  as fees are based on portfolio market value at quarter end 
at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over the company generally sells into the secondary market all fixed rate residential loan production 
the low level of interest rates during produced a high level in excess of of fixed rate production and drove mortgage banking revenues up million  or  over the prior year 
the level of interest rates  origination volume and percent of fixed rate production will significantly impact the company s ability to maintain the current level of mortgage banking revenues in in  mortgage banking revenues declined  or over  reflecting the impact of rising interest rates and a lower level of fixed rate loan production 
other noninterest income increased million  or  in versus an increase of million  or in the increase in was attributable to higher transaction volumes in the following areas which accounted for an increase of million atm debit card fees  credit card merchant fees  credit card interchange fees  accounts receivable financing  other commission revenue and safe deposit fees 
additionally  a one time gain of  was recognized on condemnation of property by the state of florida 
the increase in was attributable to credit card merchant fees  credit card interchange fees  brokerage revenues and check printing income 
noninterest income as a percent of average assets increased to in  compared to in and in  driven by service charge income and mortgage banking revenues 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  over  compared with a decrease of  or  in versus the level of noninterest expense in was significantly impacted by the company s continued expansion which added nine new offices in georgia and alabama 
factors impacting the company s noninterest expense during and are discussed below 
the company s aggregate compensation expense in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of the georgia and alabama offices  higher commissions expense related to mortgage banking  increased pension costs and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
in  both pension cost and healthcare premiums are expected to increase by approximately and  respectively 
the higher pension cost is a result of an increase in the number of plan participants and the lower than expected return on plan assets resulting from the general stock market decline 
healthcare premiums are expected to continue to increase due to additional participants and rising costs from healthcare providers 
in  total compensation increased million  or  over this increase was primarily in salaries due to raises  higher commissions and incentives 
occupancy expense including furniture  fixtures and equipment increased by million  or  in  compared to  or  in the increase was primarily due to the addition of nine offices acquired with the two georgia acquisitions and a complete data processing systems conversion 
the most significant increases occurred in depreciation  maintenance and utilities 
the increase in was attributable to higher depreciation  utilities and software licenses  and was partially offset by a decline in maintenance costs 
merger related expenses totaled  and  in and  respectively 
these expenses include severance payments  system conversions  travel and other costs associated with integrating the new offices into capital city bank 
other noninterest expense increased million  or in and decreased million  or in the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  primarily resulting from merchant credit card processing see section entitled other in liquidity and capital resources for further discussion  increased telephone costs of  due to the georgia acquisitions and expansion of the existing wide area network  increased advertising costs of  higher intangible amortization of  resulting from the georgia acquisitions  commission service fees of  resulting from higher transaction volume in merchant services  higher postage costs of  and higher credit card interchange costs of million 
the decrease in was attributable to a decrease in intangible taxes of  resulting from the elimination of this tax for banks by the state of florida  decline in other losses of  decline in telephone costs of  resulting from the completion of the wide area network  and elimination of year costs 
the net noninterest expense ratio defined as noninterest income minus noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and merger related expenses  as a percent of average assets was in  compared to in and in the company s efficiency ratio expressed as noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and merger related expenses  as a percent of taxable equivalent operating revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
income taxes the consolidated provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  compared to million in and million in the decline in the tax provision was a result of lower taxable income 
the increase in the tax provision from was primarily attributable to a higher taxable income and a decline in tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate was in  in  and in these rates differ from the statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for and is primarily attributable to the decline of tax exempt income relative to pre tax income 
tax exempt income net of the adjustment for disallowed interest as a percent of pre tax income was in  in  and in the decline during the past three years was primarily a result of maturities in the tax exempt security portfolio and management s decision to use these proceeds to fund loan growth  rather than replace maturities in the portfolio 
see section entitled financial condition for further discussion 
financial condition average assets increased million  or  from billion in to billion in average earning assets increased to billion in  a million  or  increase over average loans and funds sold increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  and were partially offset by a decline in average securities of million  or

table provides information on average balances and rates  table provides an analysis of rate and volume variances  while table highlights the changing mix of the company s earning assets over the last three years 
loans loan growth was strong during including million in loans acquired through the georgia acquisitions  the portfolio increased million  or 
areas experiencing the most significant growth included the commercial and residential real estate portfolios which  combined  grew million 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings  it can do so only by adhering to sound lending principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
thus  management will not relax its underwriting standards in order to achieve designated growth goals

allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for the estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
credit losses arise from the borrowers ability and willingness to repay  and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk  operations risk  concentration risk and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment of overall loan quality 
this is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
the balance can and will change based on changes in the assessment of the portfolio s overall credit quality 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
four components are addressed in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans that have been identified as impaired as defined by fas are reviewed for adequacy of collateral  with a specific reserve assigned to those loans when necessary 
impaired loans are defined as those in which the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
impaired loans generally include those that are past due for days or more and those classified as doubtful in accordance with the company s risk rating system 
loans classified as doubtful have a high possibility of loss  but because of certain factors that may work to strengthen the loan  its classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined 
not all loans are considered in the review for impairment  only loans that are for business purposes exceeding  are considered 
the evaluation is based on current financial condition of the borrower or current payment status of the loan 
the method used to assign a specific reserve depends on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on liquidation of collateral 
if repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses 
if repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate 
the discounted value of the cash flows is dependent on the timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower 
the reserve allocations assigned to impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the timing of cash receipts change 
commercial purpose loans exceeding  that are not considered impaired  but which have weaknesses that require closer management attention  are analyzed with a specific reserve allocated  if needed  based on the underlying value of the collateral 
the underlying value of the collateral is based on independent assessments of value 
examples of this independent assessment include appraisals  tax assessments  and evaluations from those in the business of selling assets similar to the collateral 
a general reserve is then assigned to the pool of larger loans that individually have not exhibited weaknesses as of the balance sheet date 
this reserve is allocated based on the historical loss ratio of the portfolio 
finally  large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  including consumer loans  credit card loans  and residential mortgage loans are collectively evaluated with a reserve assigned based on historical losses of that particular loan pool 
historical loss ratios are calculated quarterly by tracking actual charge offs within a specific loan type and are used to estimate losses inherent in the pool 
historical loss ratios are calculated for the previous twelve quarters  with the most recent history being emphasized because of management s belief that this more closely represents the expected near term performance of the portfolio 
the results of this calculation are adjusted for certain external factors including micro and macro economic outlook  past due and non performing trends within the portfolio  loan growth  and credit administration practices 
these factors are specifically monitored on a quarterly basis 
the adjustments to actual losses experienced over the past three years are quantitatively determined by trends in past due and nonperforming loans  loan growth and mix  and audits of internal and external examiners regarding credit administration practices 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves assigned to problem loans plus the general reserves assigned to pools of loans that are not problems 
adjustments are made when appropriate

while there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain loan losses in a particular period that are substantial in relation to the size of the allowance  management s assessment of the loan portfolio would not indicate a likelihood of this occurrence 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years 
the reserve allocations  as calculated using the above methodology  are assigned to specific loan categories corresponding to the type represented within the four components discussed 
the greatest losses experienced by the company have occurred in the consumer loan portfolio  including credit cards 
as such  the greatest amount of the allowance is allocated to consumer loans despite its relatively small balance 
management is making changes in the underwriting of consumer loans throughout the company and in the management of the credit card portfolio in an effort to reduce the charge offs associated with consumer purpose loans 
risk element assets risk element assets consist of nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate  loans past due days or more  potential problem loans and loan concentrations 
table depicts certain categories of the company s risk element assets as of december for each of the last five years 
potential problem loans and loan concentrations are discussed within the narrative portion of this section 
the company s nonperforming loans decreased  or  from a level of million at december   to million at december  during  loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
of the million removed   consisted of principal reductions  million represented loans transferred to other real estate  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status and loans refinanced  and  was charged off 
where appropriate  management has allocated specific reserves to absorb anticipated losses 
the majority of the company s charge offs in were in the consumer portfolio where loans are charged off based on past due status and are not recorded as nonaccruing loans 
the majority of the company s nonaccrual loans are secured by real estate 
specifically  approximately one half of the company s nonaccrual loans are secured by family residential properties 
these loans are believed to have little exposure to credit loss as evidenced by the relatively small amount of charge offs experienced in nonaccrual loans 
the housing markets in the areas served by the company continue to be strong despite the general decline in the economy 
consumer loans are charged off based on regulatory guidelines dictated by past due status and are not recorded as nonaccruing loans 
all nonaccrual loans exceeding  not secured by family residential properties are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when it is probable that all principal and interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms 
when a loan is considered impaired  it is reviewed for exposure to credit loss 
if credit loss is probable  a specific reserve is allocated to absorb the anticipated loss 
the company had million in loans considered impaired at year end

nonperforming assets loans plus other real estate 



nonperforming assets capital reserve nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to shareowners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if interest on nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december  restructured loans are those with reduced interest rates or deferred payment terms due to deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
other real estate totaled million at december   versus  at december  this category includes property owned by capital city bank which was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  the company added properties totaling million  and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net increase in other real estate of approximately  management does not anticipate any significant losses associated with other real estate 
potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amounts exceed of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the banks and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
furthermore  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate 
while the company has a majority of its loans secured by real estate  the primary type of real estate collateral is family residential properties 
at december   approximately of the portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
residential properties comprise approximately of the real estate portfolio 
the real estate portfolio  while subject to cyclical pressures  is not typically speculative in nature and is originated at amounts that are within or below regulatory guidelines for collateral values 
management anticipates no significant reduction in the percentage of real estate loans to total loans outstanding 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities in and  the company s average investment portfolio decreased million in each year  or and  respectively 
as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in both years  the decline in the portfolio was attributable to the maturities of investment securities in all categories 
in anticipation of future loan growth  investment maturities were not replaced during during  if loan growth does not meet management s forecast  a portion of the bank s liquidity may be invested in the securities portfolio 
in  average taxable investments decreased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
although the tax reform act of significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt securities  management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
as of december   the company may purchase additional tax exempt securities without adverse tax consequences 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized gain of million  compared to a loss of million at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

excluding acquisitions  existing markets realized growth primarily in now accounts and noninterest bearing demand accounts 
the company experienced a decline in certificates of deposits during the second half of this decline was primarily a result of increased competition and the relative low level of interest rates 
however  the decline in certificates during the second half was mostly offset by growth of nonmaturity deposits creating a favorable shift in the deposit mix and a positive impact on the bank s cost of funds 
in  the decrease was primarily due to declining balances in certificates of deposit and savings 
the decline in certificates was attributable to rising interest rates and an increase in competition 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in now  money market and noninterest bearing balances 
the most significant increase occurred in now balances primarily as a result of higher public funds

management monitors the company s financial position in an effort to ensure the company has ready access to sufficient liquid funds to meet normal transaction requirements  take advantage of investment opportunities and cover unforeseen liquidity demands 
in addition to core deposit growth  sources of funds available to meet liquidity demands include cash received through ordinary business activities ie collection of interest and fees  federal funds sold  loan and investment maturities  bank lines of credit for the company  approved lines for the purchase of federal funds by ccb and federal home loan bank advances 
the company generated approximately million in liquidity through its two georgia acquisitions in the first union branch acquisition added million in liquidity to the company 
the assumption of deposits totaled approximately million 
including the core deposit premium  the company purchased assets totaling million with the balance of million being paid to ccbg in cash 
first bankshares of west point inc generated liquidity of approximately million  primarily due to the sale of a substantial portion of west point s investment portfolio for the purpose of aligning its risk profile with that of ccb 
as of december   the company had a million credit facility under which all the funds were currently available 
the facility offers the company an unsecured  revolving line of credit for a period of three years which matures in november upon expiration of the revolving line of credit  the outstanding balance may be converted to a term loan and repaid over a period of seven years 
the term loan is to be secured by stock of a subsidiary bank equal to at least of the principal balance of the term loan 
the company  at its option  may select from various loan rates including prime  libor or the lenders cost of funds rate cof  plus or minus increments thereof 
the libor or cof rates may be fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company also has the option to select fixed rates for periods of one through five years 
in  the company reduced all of the debt outstanding on the line of credit 
the average interest rate during was 
the company s credit facility imposes certain limitations on the level of the company s equity capital  and federal and state regulatory agencies have established regulations which govern the payment of dividends to a bank holding company by its bank subsidiaries 
as of year end  the company was in compliance with all of these contractual and or regulatory requirements 
a further discussion of the company s credit facility can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million in long term debt outstanding to the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the debt consists of sixteen loans 
the interest rates are fixed and the weighted average rate at december  was 
required annual principal reductions approximate million  with the remaining balances due at maturity ranging from to the debt was used to match fund longer term  fixed rate loan products  which management elected not to fund internally from an asset liability perspective 
the debt is secured by investment securities 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the company s long term debt 
the company does not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the federal home loan bank  investment security maturities and the company s million credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
it is anticipated capital expenditures will approximate million over the next twelve months 
the capital expenditures are expected to consist primarily of three new offices in existing markets  office equipment and furniture  and technology purchases 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing the company s ability to meet its on going obligations

the ratio of shareowners equity to total assets at year end was  and  in  and  respectively 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of the total capital in the form of tier capital 
as of december   ccbg exceeded these capital guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  compared to and  respectively  in in addition  a tangible leverage ratio is now being used in connection with the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio under this standard is for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs 
an additional to may be required for other companies  depending upon their regulatory ratings and expansion plans 
on december   the company had a leverage ratio of compared to in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the company s capital adequacy 
at december   the company s common stock had a book value of per diluted share compared to in beginning in  book value has been impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities availablefor sale 
at december   the net unrealized gain was million 
at december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million and thus the net impact on equity for the year was an increase in book value of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the current unrealized gain is a result of the significant decline in interest rates during on march   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
the purchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the company acquired  shares during and  shares during on january   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock 
from march  through march   the company repurchased  shares at an average purchase price of per share 
the company offers an associate incentive plan under which certain associates are eligible to earn shares of ccbg stock based upon achieving established performance goals 
the company issued  shares  valued at approximately  in under this plan 
the company also offers stock purchase plans at a reduced price to its associates and directors 
in   shares  valued at approximately  were issued under these plans 
the board of directors approved a dividend reinvestment and optional stock purchase plan for the company in december in and  shares for this plan were purchased in the open market  and thus there were no newly issued shares under this plan 
the company offers a k plan which enables associates to defer a portion of their salary on a pre tax basis 
the plan covers substantially all of the company s associates who meet the minimum age requirement 
the plan is designed to enable participants to elect to have an amount withheld from their compensation in any plan year and placed in the k plan trust account 
matching contributions from the company can be made up to of the participant s compensation 
during and  no contributions were made by the company 
the participants may choose to invest their contributions into fifteen investment funds  including ccbg common stock 
the purchase of ccbg common stock is strictly voluntary  and there are no restrictions on the sale of ccbg common stock held in the k plan 
dividends adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to the stability of ccbg and its subsidiary bank 
cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on the company s capital levels 
when determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered 
compliance with state and federal laws and regulation  
the company s capital position and its ability to meet its financial obligations  
projected earnings and asset levels  
the ability of the bank and holding company to fund dividends 
although a consistent dividend payment is believed to be favorably viewed by the financial markets and shareowners  the board of directors will declare dividends only if the company is considered to have adequate capital 
future capital requirements and corporate plans are considered when the board considers a dividend payment 
dividends declared and paid totaled 
per share in during the fourth quarter of the quarterly dividend was raised from 
per share to 
per share 
the company declared dividends of 
per share in and 
per share in the dividend payout ratio was  and for  and  respectively 
dividends declared per share in represented a increase over inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled earnings analysis 
other as part of its card processing services operation  the bank previously maintained relationships with several independent sales organizations isos 
in late and early  a small number of one iso s merchants generated large amounts of charge backs  for which the iso or the bank have not been reimbursed 
in addition  the iso and certain merchants may have disputes about financial reserves placed with the iso 
should the iso s financial capacity be insufficient to absorb the chargebacks and cover its financial obligations arising from the disputes  the bank may face related exposure 
one lawsuit has been filed naming the iso and the bank as defendants  but the bank cannot reasonably estimate potential exposure for losses  if any  at this time 
management does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make various estimates and assumptions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is evaluated quarterly by the company for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different required allowance  and thereby a larger or smaller provision recognized as expense in any given reporting period 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses can be found in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit assets that were recognized in connection with the various acquisitions 
all intangible assets were amortized on the straight line method over various periods ranging from to years with the majority being written off over an average life of approximately years 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
core deposit assets represent the premium the company paid for core deposits 
core deposits are retail deposits that have an immediate penalty free capability and an administered rate paid 
core deposits include demand deposits  nows  savings and money market accounts 
the company makes certain estimates as it relates to the useful life of these assets  and rate of run off based on the nature of the specific assets and the customer bases acquired 
if there is a reason to believe there has been a permanent loss in value  management will assess these assets for impairment 
any changes in the original estimates resulting therefrom  may materially affect reported earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
ccbg does not actively participate in exchange rates  commodities or equities 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes ccbg to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
ccbg s asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other thantrading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company is currently liability sensitive  which generally indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  the net interest margin will be adversely impacted as the velocity and or volume of liabilities being repriced exceeds assets 
the opposite is true in a falling rate environment 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income 
nonmaturity deposits offer management greater discretion as to the direction  timing and magnitude of interest rate changes and can have a material impact on the company s interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the relative level of interest rates as compared to the current yields rates of existing assets liabilities can impact both the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest margin as rates rise and fall from one period to the next
