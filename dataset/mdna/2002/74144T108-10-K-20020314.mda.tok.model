item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios 
we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
total assets under our management were billion at december   including billion in equity securities and billion in fixed income investments 
this reflects a billion  or  decrease from the billion that we managed at the end of acquisition 
on august   we purchased robert fleming holdings interest in our consolidated subsidiary  t 
rowe price international  which at that time managed billion 
this purchase transaction resulted in goodwill of million 
coincident with the change in ownership  our international investment research contracts with robert fleming affiliates were terminated 
during the period through june   we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition to the new operating infrastructure for our international investment operations 
robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure for this subsidiary s international offices 
international expansion 
through our new subsidiary  t 
rowe price global investment services  we expanded our marketing efforts in to european investors  a move which complements our efforts in japan that began in through the daiwa sb investments venture and our subsidiary  t 
rowe price global asset management 
investors outside the united states now account for more than of our assets under management 
our expenditures to broaden our investor base may be significant and will precede revenues from any new investment advisory clients that we may obtain 
results of operations 
versus net income decreased million  or  to million  and diluted earnings per share fell from to 
a full year s amortization of goodwill arising from the t 
rowe price international acquisition accounted for 
of the decline 
total revenues declined from billion to just over billion 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds decreased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion less than in weakness in financial market valuations that began in continued through the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  pushed financial markets down to their lowest levels of the year before they recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter 
mutual fund assets ended the year at billion  down million from the average and billion from the start of the science technology fund and the international funds accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the billion net decline in mutual fund valuations during dividends paid by the mutual funds  net of reinvestments  were 
billion in net inflows from fund investors were 
billion in domestic stock funds had net investor subscriptions of more than billion while money market and bond fund investors added almost 
billion 
two us growth funds led the inflows with the small cap stock and blue chip growth funds adding a total of billion from investors 
international stock funds had net outflows of billion 
assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage fell billion during  and our advisory fees thereon were down million 
while the same financial market declines played a significant role in reducing these assets  cash inflows  primarily from third party distribution efforts and international initiatives  added about billion to assets under management in additionally  adverse market conditions pushed performance related advisory fees down million in we earn these fees primarily from a managed disposition service for distributions of venture capital investments and  though recurring  these fees vary significantly as market conditions and investment portfolios change 
administrative revenues were down million from discount brokerage commissions fell million from the prior year as investor trading activity and average commission rates were lower 
other administrative revenues declined million but were mostly offset by lower costs of the services that we provide to the mutual funds and defined contribution retirement plans 
investment income declined million to million  with smaller cash and mutual fund holdings as well as lower interest rates in accounting for the decline 
gains from our venture capital investments in that did not recur in were mostly offset by million of greater realized gains from dispositions of our available for sale mutual fund holdings 
we expect that investment income in the first half of will generally be lower than that of the comparable period 
operating expenses declined about from million in to million in compensation and related costs is our largest expense and was up only or million from our average staff size was up about versus but performance based bonus expense and the use of temporary personnel by our information technology operations were down in staff reductions  primarily in november  together with attrition during the year reduced our staff to  associates at december   a reduction from the end of our advertising and promotion expense decreased almost or million to million in as we curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that have made investors more cautious and less active 
we vary our spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and internationally 
we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first half of to be less than in the comparable period 
market conditions in the second half of the year will dictate our spending then 
international investment research fees were eliminated in august at the time of the t 
rowe price international acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expense was million higher in due primarily to additional amortization from recently completed software and technology projects  as well as the expansion of our operating facilities into new space in london in the first quarter of and in colorado springs in the fourth quarter of for the first time in several years  no facilities expansion is currently underway 
the next planned move will occur in late third quarter when our tampa service center relocates to a new leased facility 
a full year s amortization of goodwill arising from the t 
rowe price international acquisition and interest expense on our related indebtedness added million and million  respectively  to our expenses 
as a result of the issuance and adoption of new financial accounting standards  we will cease recording a recurring charge amortizing goodwill after and will evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for impairment on an annual basis using a fair value approach 
we must adopt the new accounting standards on january  and complete certain transitional testing of the goodwill carrying amount as of that date 
in order to perform this testing  we must first identify our reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill among them as of the beginning of we then have until june  to complete a comparison of the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying amounts of those reporting units as of january  if the fair values of the reporting units are at least equal to the carrying amounts of those units  then no indication of goodwill impairment exists and our adoption of the new accounting standard is complete 
while we have not completed the prescribed transitional testing at this time  we do not believe that we will recognize any impairment loss as the result of adopting the new accounting standards 
other operating expenses decreased or million from as the international transition and several technology initiatives have been brought to a close  we have substantially reduced other operating expenses 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of largely due to the full year s amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
the effective tax rate will decrease in when the goodwill amortization ceases 
minority interests declined due to the acquisition and the elimination of the interests in a remaining venture in the first quarter of versus net income increased nearly million or to million and diluted earnings per share rose from to 
total revenues increased from billion to a record billion  led by an increase of million in investment advisory fees 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds increased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion more than in however  declines in financial market valuations pushed fund assets down billion during the year 
net redemptions by fund investors were billion during defined contribution plans moved billion to other advisers on the last day of the year  offsetting net inflows that had occurred until that time 
the merger of a client into another firm and the restructuring of investments by a large state pension plan were the primary causes of the outflows at year end other fund asset decreases were the result of our redemption of almost 
billion to partially fund the t 
rowe price international acquisition and 
billion of dividends  net of reinvestments  that were paid out during mutual fund assets ended at billion  including billion in stock funds 
assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage were also higher during most of and contributed million of additional advisory fees 
in addition  performance related advisory fees earned primarily on venture capital investments that we manage were million higher in assets in other portfolios that we manage ended at billion  down from billion at the beginning of the year due primarily to international portfolios which experienced both market depreciation of billion and outflows of billion during administrative fees from advisory related services that we provide to the funds and their shareholders rose million from to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to transfer agency and recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans and the price mutual funds and includes million of b distribution fees received from the new advisor class of mutual fund shares 
administrative revenues are largely offset by the costs that we incur in providing the services  including fees paid to third parties which distribute the advisor shares to their clients 
discount brokerage added million of the increase on greater transaction volume offset by lower average commissions arising from the shift to transactions originating over the internet 
investment and other income rose more than million from to million 
net gains of million on dispositions of our stock and bond mutual fund holdings in versus losses of million recognized on fund holdings in account for million of the increase 
higher returns on our venture capital investments added million in the strong markets of late and early produced significant market gains and distributions from venture capital investments 
larger capital gain distributions resulting from our stock fund holdings added million to our income 
foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from our yen denominated debt account for a positive change of million as the losses experienced in largely reversed in operating expenses increased to million 
greater compensation and related costs  which were up million or  were attributable to increases in our rates of compensation  including performance related bonuses  and an increase in our staff size primarily to support our growing operations 
as of december   we employed more than  associates 
our advertising and promotion expenditures increased million from to million 
international investment research fees were down million from as the contract for these services terminated at the time of the t 
rowe price international acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expense was million higher in due primarily to the expansion of our operating facilities in owings mills in late and early amortization of goodwill arising from the t 
rowe price international purchase and interest expense on our acquisition indebtedness added million and million  respectively  to our expenses 
other operating expenses increased million largely due to significant broad based technology expenditures that support established and new business activities 
additional expenses in connection with our international expansion also contributed to the higher expense levels 
costs incurred for defined contribution plan recordkeeping systems and the distribution of the advisor class of fund shares also increased our expense levels  however  these charges were generally offset by additional administrative revenues 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of largely due to the new goodwill charges that are not deductible in determining our income tax expense 
minority interests declined million due to the acquisition of robert fleming s interest in t 
rowe price international 
capital resources and liquidity 
during the three years ended december   stockholders equity increased from million to nearly billion 
stockholders equity at december  includes million of unrealized investment holding gains  after provision for income taxes  and million which is restricted as to use under various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business 
net liquid assets of about million were available at the beginning of unused committed credit facilities at the beginning of include million expiring in june and million expiring in june operating activities provided cash flows of million in as net income decreased from the prior year 
comparatively  provided net operating cash inflows of million 
net cash expended in investing activities decreased million from to only million 
this significant decline is attributable to the use of million for the acquisition and the use of mutual fund proceeds to fund investments and capital expenditures in cash used in financing activities was million in this compares with cash provided by financing activities of million in net bank borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition provided cash of million in whereas we repaid million of those borrowings in there were no repurchases of common stock in compared with million used to repurchase shares in dividends paid to common stockholders were million  million higher than as the per share dividend was increased 
anticipated property and equipment acquisitions in are approximately million 
these capital expenditures and further debt reductions are expected to be funded from operating cash inflows in forward looking information

further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our future revenues will fluctuate due to many factors  including the total value and composition of assets under our management  cash inflows and outflows in the t 
rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios  fluctuations in worldwide financial markets  including those in emerging countries  resulting in appreciation or depreciation of assets under our management  the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices  the extent to which we earn performance based investment advisory fees  the expense ratios of the price mutual funds  investor sentiment and investor confidence  the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management  and broader financial services sectors  our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios  our ability to contract with the price mutual funds for payment for investment advisory related administrative services provided to the funds and their shareholders  changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans  the amount and timing of income recognized on our venture capital and other investments  and our level of success in implementing our strategy to significantly expand our business internationally 
our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds determined to terminate or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 
our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of our operating expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of advertising expenses in response to market conditions  expansion of marketing efforts both within the us and internationally  and other factors  variations in the level of compensation expense due to  among other things  performance based bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  changes in our operating expenses resulting from our acquisition of the minority interests in t

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation  and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results  including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general  or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management 
accordingly  declines of financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 
we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value  before any income tax benefits  reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during the prior twelve months 
in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of potential loss portfolio value portfolio of value stock funds domestic    international    total    blended funds   bond funds    the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year s annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at the end of during  we had net unrealized losses of million in the value of our fund investments 
investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
interest rates on our outstanding debt under the credit facility expiring in june are reset at one to six month intervals 
our borrowing rate on this debt decreased from on january  to on january  as the us federal reserve bank cut short term interest rates throughout should our cost of funds increase back to the that we experienced about months ago  and we make no repayments of principal on the existing outstanding balance of million  our interest expense for a full year would increase by million 
the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates change  the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would decrease about the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen again in  and an exchange rate gain was recognized on our yen borrowing 
in evaluating exchange rate sensitivity  a loss of million would be recognized if the yen strengthened from december  other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not material
