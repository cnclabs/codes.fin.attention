inflation management does not believe inflation had a material adverse effect on the financial statements for the periods presented 
effect of recently issued accounting standards a in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  fas also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
fas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of fas  that the company reclassify  if necessary  the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in fas fas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  fas requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in fas fas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
fas also requires the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of adoption 
the company is also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of fas certain of the company s business combinations effected prior to june  were accounted for using both the pooling of interests and purchase methods 
the pooling of interests method does not result in the recognition of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets 
as a result  the adoption of fas and fas will not have any effect with respect to the company s prior transactions that were accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
however  all future business combinations will be accounted for under the purchase method  which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
with respect to the company s business combinations that were effected prior to june   using the purchase method of accounting  the net carrying amounts of the resulting goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  were million and million  respectively 
amortization expense during the year ended december  was million of which million was amortization of goodwill and million was amortization of other intangibles
