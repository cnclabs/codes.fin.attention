this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that any of the events anticipated by the forward looking statements will occur or  if any of them do  what impact they will have on us 
overview the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business since its inception on may  the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
for the period from our inception through december   we have purchased or entered into local marketing  management and consulting agreements with radio stations throughout the us and caribbean 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of these acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
as of december   we owned and operated stations in us markets and provide sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to stations in us markets 
we currently own five stations and have obtained a license to commence operations on one station in the caribbean market 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the us based on number of stations 
we believe we are the ninth largest radio broadcasting company in the us by net revenues  based on our pro forma net revenues 
we will own and operate a total of radio stations in us markets upon fcc approval and consummation of all pending acquisitions and divestitures exclusive of new market move ins 
advertising revenue and broadcast cash flow our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally twice or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 

table of contents the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting rating is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income during the years ended december   and we will seek to continue to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december    and approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage interep national radio sales  inc  a national representative company 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
results of operations management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december   and have been presented on a historical basis 
additionally  for net revenue  operating expenses  and operating income before depreciation and amortization we have included management s discussion and analysis of results of operations on a pro forma basis 
year ended december  versus the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the disposition of radio stations during fiscal and the first quarter of approximately million of the decrease  lower sales volume associated with the company s implementation of stringent credit and collections policies and the current economic slowdown and tightening corporate advertising budgets approximately million of decrease  which has impacted the entire broadcast industry 
the september  terrorist attacks in new york  ny  which significantly affected fourth quarter advertising sales  also contributed to the decrease in revenues versus the prior year 
in addition  on a same station basis  net revenue for the stations in markets operated for at least a full year decreased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to net revenues of million for the year ended december  the decrease in same station net revenue was primarily the result of the company s implementation of stringent credit and collections policies and the current economic slowdown and tightening corporate advertising budgets  which has impacted the entire broadcast industry  as well as the events of september   which significantly affected fourth quarter advertising sales 
station operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees decreased million  or  to 
table of contents million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the station portfolio due to the disposition of radio stations during fiscal and approximately million of decrease  expense reductions achieved as a result of improved management control of cost of sales and other operating expense saving initiatives approximately million of decrease and a million decrease in the amount of bad debt expense recognized in versus the provision for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was the direct result of management s implementation of stringent credit and collection policies that have yielded significantly lower levels of bad debt expense and accounts receivable write off experience 
the unusually high bad debt expense recorded in the prior year was primarily the result of the following factors the completion of the first and second phases of the asset exchange and sales transactions with clear channel communications  and the coincidental loss of local employee incentive to enforce the collection of receivables in divested markets  the detrimental effects of certain pre existing credit and collection policies and sales employee compensation policies  the significant turnover of management and sales force  including representatives who maintained relationships with trade debtors and had responsibility for ensuring collection of outstanding invoices  and the overall declines in the us economy 
in addition  on a same station basis  for the stations in markets operated for at least a full year  station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for comparative purposes  the unusually high bad debt charge for approximately million has been excluded from same station operating expenses for the year ended december  the decrease in same station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees is attributable to improved management control of costs of sales and other expense saving initiatives 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization relating to radio station acquisitions consummated during and a full year of depreciation and amortization on radio station acquisitions consummated during partially offsetting this increase was a reduction for depreciation and amortization of stations that were divested during and lma fees 
lma fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the purchase of radio stations subsequent to december  that were formerly operated under local marketing  management and consulting agreements and the related discontinuance of fees associated with such agreements 
corporate  general and administrative expenses 
corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  certain unusual reorganization  severance and travel expenses along with unusually high audit and legal expenses incurred during the year ended december  primarily contributed to the increased corporate expenses in that year 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expense for was also attributable to the successful consolidation of the company s corporate offices  formerly located in chicago  illinois and milwaukee  wisconsin  to atlanta  georgia and the related cost savings associated with the elimination of duplicative corporate resources 
restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring and impairment charges decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the quarter ended december   certain events and circumstances caused the company to review the carrying amounts of the long lived assets of its caribbean operations 
these events included the continued deterioration of the business climate in the english speaking caribbean  which 
table of contents has generated valuation declines of media related enterprises in the area  and management s determination that the caribbean operations are not expected to generate the future cash flows that were projected in prior periods 
certain long lived assets were determined to be impaired because the carrying amounts of the assets exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets 
these impairment losses were measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceeded the fair values of the assets  determined based on the discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets 
the resulting impairment charges totaled million  consisting of a million charge to write off goodwill and the related broadcast license  and a million charge to write down property and equipment 
for the year ended december   net revenue and operating loss prior to the impairment charge of the company s caribbean operations were million and million  respectively 
during june the company implemented two separate board approved restructuring programs to i focus the company s operations on its core business  radio broadcasting  by terminating several internet service pilot projects and internet infrastructure development projects  and ii make the company s corporate infrastructure more efficient and responsive to our markets by relocating effective october   all corporate services that had been conducted in milwaukee  wi and chicago  il to atlanta  ga 
total costs incurred as a result of the restructuring programs were million  which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force  charges related to vacating leased facilities  impaired leasehold improvements at vacated leased facilities  and impaired assets related to the internet businesses 
in connection with the continued strategic initiative to focus on its core radio business  the company also conducted a review of certain non radio operations during the fourth quarter of this strategic review triggered an impairment review of the long lived assets of these operations  and it was determined that the carrying value of certain long lived assets exceeded the projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
the estimated future net cash flows were estimated based on present levels of sales volume  because the company does not expect to devote significant funding to the development of products and services provided by these non radio operations in the future 
accordingly  the company recorded a million impairment write down consisting of the following i a million impairment charge to write off goodwill of bsi  and ii a million impairment charge to write off the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  the advisory board of nevada 
for the year ended december   net revenue and operating loss of bsi were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   net revenue and operating loss of the advisory board of nevada were million and million  respectively 
other expense income 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to lower cash reserves and related decreases in interest income earned 
the increase in the company s debt levels under its senior credit facility million as of december  versus as of december  did not materially increase interest expense for the year ended december  due to decreasing interest rates on the respective outstanding debt amounts effective interest rate as of december  versus as of december  
other income  net  decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
other income  net  realized in the prior year  was primarily attributable to gains realized on the sale of assets 
other income  net  realized in the current year is primarily the result of gains realized on asset sales during the year approximately million  offset by a million charge recorded by the company in connection with a proposed settlement of certain class action lawsuits 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense decreased by million  to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a larger loss before income taxes along with a million book versus tax gain difference realized on assets sold in january the book versus tax gain difference contributed to a significantly lower effective tax rate for the current year 

table of contents preferred stock dividends  deemed dividends  accretion of discount and premium on redemption of preferred stock 
preferred stock dividends  accretion of discount and premium on redemption of preferred stock increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased dividends resulting from increasing levels of the company s series a preferred stock million of increase  dividends associated with the company s issuance of series b preferred stock in october million of increase and the accretion of million  representing the remaining unamortized original issue costs  recognized as a result of the company s redemption of all of the outstanding series b preferred stock during the quarter ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss attributable to common stockholders increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  broadcast cash flow 
as a result of the factors described above  broadcast cash flow increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  broadcast cash flow consists of operating income loss before depreciation  amortization  lma fees  corporate general and administrative expense and restructuring and impairment charges 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating the company because it is a measure widely used in the broadcasting industry to evaluate a radio company s operating performance 
nevertheless  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income loss  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap  this measure may not be compared to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
ebitda 
as a result of the factors described above  ebitda increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  ebitda consists of operating income loss before depreciation  amortization  lma fees and restructuring and impairment charges

intangible assets 
intangible assets  net of amortization  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill  although the company possesses certain other intangible assets obtained in connection with our acquisitions  such as non compete agreements 
the increase in intangible assets  net during is attributable to acquisitions during the period  less the net dispositions in the asset exchange and sale transaction with clear channel 
specifically identified intangible assets  including broadcasting licenses  are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the related acquisition 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets and specifically identified intangible assets 
although intangible assets are recorded in the company s financial statements at amortized cost  we believe that such assets  especially broadcast licenses  can significantly appreciate in value by successfully executing the company s operating strategies 
during  the company recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of the asset exchange and sale transaction with clear channel communications 
the company also recognized similar gains in fiscal we believe these gains indicate that certain internally generated intangible assets  which are not recorded for accounting purposes  can significantly increase the value of our portfolio of stations over time 
the company s strategic initiative to focus on its core radio business is designed to enhance the overall value of our stations and maximize the value of the related broadcast licenses

seasonality the company expects that its operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of the company s business reflects the adult orientation of the company s formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in the company s quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of the company s cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations and to a lesser extent  working capital needs  capital expenditures and interest and debt service payments 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from the offering of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under credit 
table of contents agreements 
our principal need for funds in the future is expected to include the need to fund future acquisitions  interest and debt service payments  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we believe the company s present cash positions and availability under its existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital needs through march  we have entered into a commitment letter pursuant to which a group of banks have committed to provide credit facilities for up to million  on the terms and conditions set forth in the commitment letter 
we expect to complete this new financing  subject to the negotiation of definitive documents  prior to the end of march  concurrently with completing our acquisitions of aurora communications and dbbc 
we intend to use approximately million to repay all amounts owing under our existing credit facility  and million to repay the indebtedness being assumed in connection with  together with the cash portions of the purchase price for  the acquisitions of aurora communications and dbbc  and other costs and expenses related to those acquisitions 
the facilities are expected to include million in the form of a reducing credit facility  a portion of which will be available in the form of letters of credit  million in the form of a term loan facility  and million in the form of a second term loan facility 
while we do not expect that the terms of the definitive financing documents will differ materially from the terms and conditions of the commitment letter  we will not be able to consummate either acquisition if we are unable to complete the financing on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the proceeds of the new credit facility will be sufficient to complete the pending acquisitions and meet the company s working capital and other funding needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the ability of the company to complete its pending acquisitions is dependent upon on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on the terms  and on the timetable  currently contemplated 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations increased million  to million  from net cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the maturing of our markets and increased focus on managing our current properties 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a lower level of acquisition activity in the current year as compared to the prior year and cash proceeds received in connection with the completion of the third and final phase of the asset exchange and sale transactions with clear channel 
cash proceeds from the first and second phases of the clear channel asset exchange and sale transactions in were received in a restricted escrow account and were remitted directly to the seller of replacement properties acquired by the company 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in the current year was primarily the result of borrowings under the company s credit facility

the financing arrangements are subject to negotiation of definitive documentation and final terms and conditions 
the ability of the company to complete the pending acquisitions is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing 
as of december   million of escrow deposits were outstanding related to pending transactions 
subsequent to december   million of deposits were applied toward transactions completed 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain financing necessary to consummate those remaining pending acquisitions  the company could be liable for approximately million in purchase price 
we expect to consummate most of our pending acquisitions during  although there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated within that time frame  or at all 
in three of the markets in which there are pending acquisitions petitions to deny have been filed against the company s fcc assignment applications 
all such petitions and fcc staff inquiries must be resolved before fcc approval can be obtained and the acquisitions consummated 
in addition  from time to time the company completes acquisitions following the initial grant of an assignment application by the fcc staff but before such grant becomes a final order  and a petition to review such a grant may be filed 
there can be no assurance that such grants may not ultimately be reversed by the fcc or an appellate court as a result of such petitions  which could result in the company being required to divest the assets it has acquired 
the ability of the company to make future acquisitions in addition to the pending acquisitions is dependent upon on the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing

under the terms of the credit facility  the company is subject to certain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including but not limited to maximum leverage covenants  minimum interest and fixed charge coverage covenants  limitations on asset dispositions and the payment of dividends

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   the company has made the determination that its deferred tax assets  the primary component of which is the company s net operating loss carryforward  are fully realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities that are anticipated to reverse during the carryforward period 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents the company has significant intangible assets recorded in its accounts 
certain of the company s stations operate in highly competitive markets 
the company determines the recoverability of its intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
future adverse changes in listenership patterns on its stations  industry trends and existing competitive pressures could result in a material impairment of its intangible assets in the future

accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 

table of contents the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  the company will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of income 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for which amortization will stop upon the adoption of sfas no 
was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether the company will incur any transition impairment losses related to its identifiable intangible assets or goodwill 
when amortization of the company s broadcast licenses is ceased on january  due to the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets will no longer be assured within the company s net operating loss carry forward period 
accordingly  the company expects to take a non cash charge of approximately million to income tax expense during the quarter ended march  to establish a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets 
in august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on january  
table of contents intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 

table of contents risk factors many statements contained in item and elsewhere in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following we face many unpredictable business risks which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including certain risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  listenership  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations  newspapers and other entertainment and communications media  changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the united states department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
we are dependent on federally issued broadcast licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more or our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must also comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be successful in consummating our pending acquisitions 
as of december   the company was a party to various agreements to acquire stations across markets 
our consummation of these pending acquisitions or future pending acquisitions is subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals and our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under the federal and state antitrust laws 
our pending or future acquisitions may also be subject to a waiting period and possible review by the department of 
table of contents justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on our ability to consummate the pending acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing  if necessary  to complete the pending acquisitions or future pending acquisitions 
as a result  our ability to consummate the pending acquisitions or future pending acquisitions is uncertain 
we may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions 
upon the completion of our pending acquisitions  we will own and operate radio stations across markets 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations  and the potential loss of customer relationships and related revenues as a result of a change in ownership 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired as part of the pending acquisitions or future pending acquisitions 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have a material adverse effect on us 
as of december   our long term debt of million was approximately of our stockholders equity 
our credit facility and the notes each have interest and principal repayment obligations which are substantial in amount and could have a substantial impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding the pending acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
as of december   million was available under our million credit facility 
on or around march   the company plans to refinance its current indebtedness with a new million credit facility  the terms of which are currently being negotiated 
we believe that the proceeds of the new credit facility will be sufficient to complete the pending acquisitions and meet the company s working capital and other funding needs 
however  the ability of the company to complete its pending acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to obtain such additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing 
any additional borrowings under our present credit facility or future credit facilities would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
the lenders have taken security interests in substantially all of our consolidated assets and we have pledged the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our business 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios in the future 
we also may incur debt obligations in connection with future acquisitions that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the debt we expect to incur in connection with acquisition activity may require us to divest assets  modify or enter into a new credit facility if certain covenants in our current credit facility would be violated 
the loss of key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of about us 
although we believe that  in making any such statements  our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  any such statement may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected 
when used in this document  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  and similar expressions  as they relate to us or our management  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those described under risk factors in this form k and as otherwise described in our periodic filings with the sec from time to time 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements  certain of which are beyond our control  include the impact of general economic conditions in the us and in other countries in which we currently do business  industry conditions  including existing competition and future competitive technologies  fluctuations in exchange rates and currency values  capital expenditure requirements  legislative or regulatory requirements  interest rates  taxes  and access to capital markets 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that any of the events anticipated by the forward looking statements will occur or  if any of them do  what impact they will have on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 

table of contents further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the acquisition of caribbean communications company ltd  ccc  the company has operations in countries throughout the english speaking eastern caribbean 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company has operations 
the company maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations generated a net loss of million for the year ended december   prior to the write down of certain long lived assets 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the eastern caribbean dollar or the trinidad and tobago dollar would change net income for the year ended december  by an amount less than million 
equity value risk during the quarter ended june   the company reached an agreement in principle to settle certain class action lawsuits 
see legal proceedings 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the lawsuits are to be dismissed in exchange for million in cash and  shares of common stock 
as the settlement is contingent upon document negotiation and court approval  the company initially measured the stock portion of the settlement based on the closing share price on june  subsequent to june   the company has remeasured the settlement liability based on the company s closing share price at each balance sheet date 
due to the volatility associated with the price of the company s common stock  significant increases in the stock price could have an adverse effect on the final reported settlement expense
