item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation e cc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company and to emmis operating company and its subsidiaries collectiv ely eoc 
eoc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ecc in connection with the company s reorganization see note c 
to our co nsolidated financial statements on june  unless otherwise noted  all disclosures contained in the management s discus sion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the form k apply to emmis and eoc 
emmis generally evaluates the performance of its operating entities based on broadcast cash flow bcf and publishing cash flow pcf 
management believes that bcf and pcf are useful because they provid e a meaningful comparison of operating performance between companies in the industry and serve as an indicator of the market v alue of a group of stations or publishing entities 
bcf and pcf are generally recognized by the broadcast and publishing indu stries as a measure of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting and publishing grou ps 
bcf and pcf do not take into account emmis debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  bcf and pcf a re not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in emmis business or other discretionary uses 
bcf and pcf are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance w ith accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
moreover  bcf and pcf are not standardized measures and may be calculated in a number of ways 
emmis defines bcf and pcf as revenues net o f agency commissions and operating expenses 
the primary source of broadcast advertising revenues is the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
publishing entities derive revenue from subscriptions and sale of print advertising 
b roadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements are aired 
publication revenue is recognized in the month of delivery o f the publication 
the most significant broadcast operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with programming  advertising and promotion  and station general and administrative costs 
significant publishing operating e xpenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with producing the magazine  and general and administrative costs 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its entities charge 
these rates are in large part based on the entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demograph ic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron r adio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a st ation s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and adve rtising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically e xchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company general ly confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have pa id cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spot s paid for in trade 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired and retai ned ten radio stations  nine television stations and three magazine publications for an aggregate cash purchase price of billion

although we expect all of our stations w ill broadcast a digital signal by the end of fiscal  we will incur additional costs  after fiscal  to upgrade the digit al signals of four of our local stations and our nine satellite stations 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility

all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
as of february   eoc s weighted average b orrowing rate under its credit facility  including the effects of interest rate swaps see discussion in item a 
below  was appr oximately and the weighted average borrowing rate  after taking into account amounts outstanding under the senior subordinat ed notes  was approximately

ecc has no additional debt service requirements in the next twelve month period since interest on its senior discount notes accretes into the princi pal balance of the notes until march however  ecc has preferred stock dividend requirements of million for the next twe lve month period 
the terms of ecc s preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share on each januar y  april  july and october while emmis has sufficient liquidity to declare and pay the dividends as they become du e  it was not permitted to do so for the october   january  and april  payments 
emmis leverage ratio und er the senior discount notes indenture exceeded for the october  january and april payments 
its leverage ratio under the sen ior subordinated notes indenture exceeded for the january and april payments 
for each of these dividend dates  ecc s bo ard of directors set the record date  but did not declare the dividend 
instead  on each payment date a wholly owned  unrestri cted subsidiary of eoc made a payment of 
per share to each preferred shareholder of record 
this subsidiary was permitt ed to make the payment to the preferred shareholders under the senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes indentures 
cu rrently  emmis meets its leverage ratio requirements under the senior subordinated notes and expects to meet its leverage ratio requirements under the senior discount notes upon application of its april equity proceeds see sources of liquidity 
we expect ecc s board of directors to declare each dividend and deem the obligation to pay each dividend to have been discharged by the subsidiary s prior payment 
we also expect our board of directors to declare  and for emmis to pay  the july  divi dend in the ordinary course of business

with respect to eoc  net working capital  excluding as sets held for sale  was million at february  and million at february  we typically use our excess cash to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had a large cash balance as of february  due to borrowi ngs under term loans when we refinanced our credit facility in december  which was used to close our acquisition of three radio stations in march the decrease in net working capital from february  to february  was due to the dec rease in cash described above and the collection of tax refunds receivable related cash collected was used to repay outstanding debt 
in december  emmis instituted a pay cut for substantially all of its non contract employees and also began a stock compensation program under its equity incentive plan 
we expect the stock compensation program  which currently e xtends through december  to result in reductions of approximately million in emmis cash compensation expense  mill ion of which will be reflected in fiscal we expect to issue approximately million shares during the first year of the plan 
while no formal decisions have been made  it is likely that the program will continue in some form during the next fisca l year 
on april   we had million available under our credit facility  less million in outstanding letters o f credit 
in april  ecc completed the sale of million shares of its class a common stock at per share resulting in total proceeds of million

also effective may  em mis completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of kxpk fm in denver  colorado to entravision communications corporat ion for million 
the proceeds from the sale of these stations were used to repay outstanding obligations under the credit faci lity 
in connection with the million of completed or planned debt repa yments described above  emmis expects to write off approximately million of deferred debt costs in the first quarter of our fis cal as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acqui sitions of radio and television stations  as well as publishing properties 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not b e able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  co nsequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will c ontinue to be renewed in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets that requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets  including broa dcast licenses 
under sfas  goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of opera tions  but instead the recorded value of certain indefinite lived intangibles including broadcast licenses will be tested fo r impairment at least annually with impairment being measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
g oodwill will also be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to b e amortized over their useful lives and measured for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or dis posal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas and began our impairment review on march  we have engaged an in dependent appraiser to conduct valuations of our indefinite lived intangible assets and expect to complete our review after th e valuations are completed at the end of may as of february   we had net unamortized goodwill and broadcast l icenses in the amount of million and  million  respectively 
the adoption of sfas will eliminate our amortiza tion of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  which was approximately million and million in the years ended f ebruary  and  respectively 
while this expense will no longer be reflected on future financial statements  it remai ns deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we expect that our impairment review  once it is completed  will result in writ e downs of some of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  but we cannot currently determine the amount of the write d owns 
however  we believe the write down may be material 
upon adoption  any transitional impairment loss recognized under s fas will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change of accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operation s

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the imp airment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single model to account for impairment of assets to be held or di sposed  incorporating guidelines for accounting and disclosure of discontinued operations 
this statement supercedes sfas and was adopted by the company on march  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operation s or financial position 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and broadcast cash flow 
for our radio operations  this seasonalit y is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all of our segments during the months o f october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
finally  particularly in our television operations  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered calendar years 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly since our senior bank debt is largely floating rate debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial po sition  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rate s 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivat ive instruments and hedging activities  as amended in june of by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these statements  which were effective for emmis on march   establish accounting and reporting stan dards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
these statements require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  depending on wheth er the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction  and on the type of hedge transaction 
gains or los ses on derivative instruments reported in the other comprehensive income must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current period 
these standards result in additional volatility in reported assets  liabilities  earnings and other compr ehensive income 
sfas no 
requires that as of the date of initial adoption the d ifference between the fair value of the derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet and the previous carrying amou nt of those derivatives be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a cha nge in accounting principle in accordance with apb accounting changes 
on march   emmis recorded the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations and the financial position of emmis 
sfas no 
further requires that the fair value and effectiveness of each hedging instrument must be measured quarterly 
the result of each measurement could result in fluctuations in reported as sets  liabilities  other comprehensive income and earnings as these changes in fair value and effectiveness are recorded to the financial statements 
for the year ended february   the fluctuations to the aforementioned areas were immaterial t o the financial statements taken as a whole and we anticipate an immaterial effect on an ongoing basis 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our cre dit facility  or approximately of eoc s total outstanding debt credit facility and senior subordinated debt and of emmis total outstanding debt eoc s debt plus our senior discount notes bears interest at variable rates 
emmis currently he dges a portion of its outstanding debt with interest rate swap arrangements that effectively set the credit facility s underlying base rate at a weighted average rate of on the three month libor for agreements in place as of february  the credit facility requires eoc to have fixed interest rates for a two year period on at least of its total outstanding debt  as define d including the senior subordinated debt 
after the first two years  this ratio of fixed to floating rate debt must be maintai ned if eoc s total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements at february  totaled million  and the agreements expire at various dates beginning february  to february  based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt  including the effect of interest rate swaps  were to increase by  our annual interest expense would be high er by approximately million 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidat ed in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge since some of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis owns a interest in an argentinean subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency peso  which until january  was tied to the us dollar through the argentine government s convertibility plan 
in january  the argentine government allowed the peso to devalue and trade against the us dollar independently 
while emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period peso to dollar  or fo rint to dollar  exchange rates for calendar  we believe any further devaluation of the forint or peso would have an immater ial effect on our financial statements taken as a whole  as the hungarian and argentine stations accounted for approximately of emmis broadcast cash flow  approximately of emmis total revenues and less than of emmis total assets as of  and for th e year ended  february  both subsidiaries have or have had outstanding loans denominated in us dollars 
in fiscal  the hungarian subsidiary repaid million in dollar denominated loans and at february  has million outstanding 
also in fiscal and subsequent to the devaluation of the peso  the argentinean subsidiary repaid million in dollar denominated loans and as of february  has no dollar denominated loans outstanding 
no gain or lo ss resulted from these transactions on a consolidated basis 
emmis maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to fore ign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
