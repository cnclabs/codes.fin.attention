item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this document  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in this document 
overview we provide online learning courses and services  which we refer to as custom e learning solutions 
we were founded in april in fiscal  we invested in both course content development and research and development as we built our course offerings and technology  releasing our first course in the later part of fiscal since fiscal  we have made significant investments in content research and development  sales and marketing activities  technology research and development  web delivery  and customer support 
we have also experienced significant headcount increases during this period 
we grew from employees on march  to on march  to on march  and to employees as of march  our revenues increased from  in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal sources of revenues and revenue recognition policy we deliver our custom e learning solutions through a catalog of existing courses and through customized content tailored to the specific needs of our customers 
we refer to the individuals taking courses as participants 
customized e learning courses have accounted for  and we expect will continue to account for  a significant portion of our total revenues 
we generate revenues by delivering courses included in our course catalog as well as delivering our customized e learning courses to participants 
customers that enter into delivered learning contracts provide participants with access to our online courses and tutor support 
additionally  customers are provided with access to management systems that allow them to track and monitor participants performance 
delivered learning contracts typically allow for a specific number of registered participants  based on a per participant fee 
these contracts also typically limit the period of time over which participants can register for and complete an online course 
we begin recognizing these delivered learning fees when a participant registers for a course 
these fees are recognized ratably over the time period a participant has access to the course  which is typically six months 
customers typically pay for the courses in advance of the anticipated timeframe of course registration and do not receive refunds for the unused portion of the available registrations agreed to in the contract 
in cases where we allow unlimited access to our courses for a specific period of time  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we also derive revenues from contracts that require development of tailored e learning solutions 
typically  these learning solution service revenues are generated from performance consulting services  implementation services  course content development  instructional plan design  and release of the course for access by participants and are recognized as earned in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production type contracts  as development progresses on the percentage of completion method 
we measure the percentage of completion based on the ratio of actual custom development or service costs incurred to date  to total estimated costs to complete the custom course or service 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts will be made on a contract by contract basis and recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  there have been no such losses 
custom contracts typically call for non refundable payments due upon achievement of certain milestones in the production of courses or in consulting services 
delivered learning fees and learning solution service revenues are each recognized only when collection is probable and there is evidence that we have completed our obligation 
if a contract includes both delivered learning fees and learning solution services  the revenues are apportioned consistent with the value associated with each and the term of the contract 
in all cases  these revenues are recognized in accordance with the policies detailed above 
we have entered into revenue sharing agreements with some of our customers and have certain reseller agreements 
under revenue sharing agreements  we receive royalties or similar payments based on sales of courses by the customer 
under reseller agreements  we provide the reseller with courses at a discount from our list price 
the reseller then assumes responsibility for sales  marketing  and related activities  and we would not expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses in connection with reseller sales 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to forecast future operating performance 
although our revenues have grown in recent years  this growth rate may not be sustainable 
in addition  we have never been profitable and expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future as we increase our content research and development  technology research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we have experienced losses in each quarter since our inception and expect that our quarterly losses will continue at least through the next three quarters 
we expect that these losses will result in large part from our ongoing emphasis on course development and sales and marketing activities 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and the percentage of our revenues from any one customer can be material 
for example  in fiscal  our largest customer  eds  accounted for and another customer accounted for of our total revenues of million  or and  respectively  when excluding the forgiveness of a million penalty associated with the restructuring of an agreement with eds 
we expect that eds and other major customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues during future fiscal periods 
sales to our largest customer comprised of our revenues in fiscal sales to our largest customer comprised of our revenues in fiscal in fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of  in fiscal  and million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in connection with an acquisition 
these amounts are being amortized over the four year vesting period of the options using the multiple option approach 
stock based compensation expense of  million was recorded in fiscal  million was recorded in fiscal  and million was recorded in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net operating loss carryforwards from inception through march   we incurred net losses for federal and state income tax purposes and have not recognized any income tax provision or benefit 
as of march   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state purposes  respectively 
given our limited operating history and losses incurred to date  coupled with difficulty in forecasting future results  a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
furthermore  as a result of changes in our equity ownership from our preferred stock offerings and initial public offering  utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations 
this is due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the degree of any such limitation cannot presently be estimated 
to date  we have not performed an evaluation to determine if such a limitation exists  and we may not perform such an evaluation until and unless we are profitable in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization

tct s results of operations have been included in the company s results of operations since the effective date of the acquisition 
strategic alliance with electronic data systems corporation on july  the company entered into an agreement with eds pursuant to which eds was issued two separate performance warrants to purchase shares of digitalthink common stock 
under the terms of the first warrant  eds could earn warrants to purchase up to  shares of digitalthink common stock exercisable at per share 
the warrant could have been earned when eds delivered third party customers from the united states prior to july   which generated a total of million of contractually committed revenue to digitalthink recognizable by july  the warrants expired october  this warrant contained a significant disincentive for non performance 
if eds failed to deliver the full million of contracted  united states revenue by july   eds agreed to pay digitalthink million 
under the terms of the second warrant  eds could earn warrants for up to  shares of digitalthink common stock exercisable at per share 
the warrant could have been earned when eds delivered third party customers from outside the united states prior to july   which generated a total of million of contractually committed revenue to digitalthink recognizable by july  the warrants expired october  this warrant contained a significant disincentive for non performance 
if eds failed to deliver the full million of contracted  non united states revenue by july   eds agreed to pay digitalthink million 
the company calculated a fixed non cash charge of million related to this transaction  based on the fair value of the warrants issued 
a portion of the warrant vested at the date of the transaction resulting in an immediate charge of million 
amortization of the remaining warrant expense would occur over three years from july through july  in proportion to the amount of revenue generated under the agreement  or on a straight line basis  whichever is faster 
through march   amortization was recorded on a straight line basis totaling million 
on march   digitalthink restructured the agreement entered into with eds  whereby eds has surrendered its vested and unvested warrants to purchase shares of digitalthink common stock and digitalthink has forgiven the million total non performance penalty associated with these warrants 
therefore  a charge of approximately million was recorded as a reduction of revenue and a credit of approximately million was recorded as other income 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets as part of our ongoing review of the company s operations and financial performance  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of the our long lived assets to be held for use including goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed pursuant to sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the conclusion of that assessment was that the value of the technology purchased associated with the arista acquisition was no longer being utilized in current product offerings and was not part of the product roadmap for the future 
as a result  we recorded charges of million to write off the arista goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal as it no longer had any recoverable value 
in addition  it is likely we may incur additional reductions in goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
strategic initiative restructuring charge since the middle of fiscal year  the company and its industry have experienced a progressive downturn  the primary direct cause of which has been a decrease in new training initiatives and a decrease in expenditures by most fortune companies 
the company believes that this decrease can be attributable to  among other things a constrained capital markets  and b other factors  including the general economic business slowdown and other higher priority objectives at potential clients 
the result has been a decrease in the overall demand for e learning training 
in response  buyers are exhibiting caution when making significant expenditures 
moreover  as the economic slowdown continues  the company s current customers delayed committed projects to reduce their spending 
consequently  the impact of the slowdown on the company s business is magnified  as it faces declining sales as the result of its customers declining business and the resulting adjustment to their spending levels 
in march we initiated a strategic initiative  under which we restructured our business in response to the current market environment and as part of our continuing program to create efficiencies within our operations 
we recorded total restructuring charges of million as part of our strategic initiative  which included the following o reducing our workforce by approximately employees  mainly within the learning services organization  resulting in a thousand severance charge 
approximately thousand was paid in march  and approximately thousand will be paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal o consolidating our sales  administrative and content and technology development facilities through building and site closures  from a total of approximately  square feet into approximately  square feet 
as of march   seven sites have been vacated san diego  california  chislom  minnesota  detroit  michigan  alameda  california  two facilities in san francisco  california and our office in the united kingdom 
property and equipment that was disposed or removed from operations resulted in a charge of million and consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million associated with leases related to excess or closed facilities  which represents the excess of the remaining lease obligations over estimated market value  net of anticipated sublease income 
amounts accrued net of anticipated sublease proceeds related to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through historical results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our statement of operations

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the following accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
the company has two types of revenue delivered learning fees and learning solution services 
delivered learning fees allow access to training systems  courses hosted by the company  tutor support  and other learning materials for a fixed period  typically six months 
delivered learning fees are recognized ratably over this access period 
learning solution services revenue consists of revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the value  scope and duration of each course hour 
revenue for these projects is recognized on percentage of completion  in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production type contracts  as development progresses based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is based on the ratio of actual custom development or service costs incurred to date  to total estimated costs to complete the custom course or service 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future learning services margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
we review  with assistance from our sales team  the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for all specific receivables that we judge to be unlikely of collection 
in addition  we record an estimated reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we have not established a specific reserves 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s credit worthiness known to us 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
effective april  the company will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
it is likely we may incur additional reductions in goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
during the year ended march   the company recorded an impairment loss related to goodwill of million associated with the arista acquisition 
operating leases 
we have many operating lease agreements related to our office buildings throughout the united states  the united kingdom and india 
the agreements qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and  as such  the assets are not included on our balance sheet 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under the agreements  but if we default on our commitments and are unable to remedy the default quickly enough  the lessors may terminate all remaining commitments and demand payment equal to the lessor s net present value of all future lease payments 
if we default on the leases and are required to make payment  this will decrease our cash available for working capital and could require us to find alternate facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement 
as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants 
for further information on these leases  please refer to our commitments section under liquidity and capital resources and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have chosen to account for our common stock incentive awards under the intrinsic value method  in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
this accounting policy is applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would have been affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using apb opinion no 
is included in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements

to date  we have met our operating expense requirements primarily from the proceeds of our equity offerings 
deferred revenue decreased from million at march  to million at march  deferred revenue results from customer prepayments of delivered learning fees and learning solutions services 
in both cases  prepayments remain in deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria have been met 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and net cash provided by investing activities totaled in fiscal the source of cash resulted from the sales of marketable securities offset by the acquisition of capital assets  including hardware for our web site  computer and office equipment  and platform development costs  and purchases of marketable securities

in december we entered into a million line of credit agreement  expiring in december  and had available million from this line of credit as of march  subsequent to march   the balance on the line of credit of million was repaid 
the company leases its facilities and certain equipment and furniture under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal and thereafter 
future lease payments under the operating lease agreements are approximately as follows fiscal year ending march  s thereafter  total  we believe our existing cash resources and available borrowings are sufficient to finance our presently anticipated operating expenses and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors 
the rate of expansion of our operations in response to potential growth opportunities and competitive pressures will affect our capital requirements as will funding of continued net losses and substantial negative cash flows 
additionally  we may need additional capital to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
actual resources sought may differ materially 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure a larger bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
currently  we have no other immediately available sources of liquidity 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors 
interest rate risk as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  consisting of cash and highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
additionally the company had marketable securities  classified as available for sale  with maturities greater than three months totaling million 
these investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates of from the market rates in effect at march  would cause the fair value of these investments to change by an immaterial amount 
declines in interest rates over time would result in lower interest income 
foreign currency and exchange rate risk almost all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in us dollars and are primarily from the united states 
however  a portion of our future revenue may be derived from international customers 
revenues from these customers may be denominated in the local currency of the applicable countries 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to significant foreign currency fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  as we engage in business outside the united states  changes in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could make us less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposure  and may use financial instruments to limit this exposure  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a materially negative impact on our business
