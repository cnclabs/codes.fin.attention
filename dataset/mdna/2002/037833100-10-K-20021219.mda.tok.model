item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition below 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
all information presented herein is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped  and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
revenue on multiple element sales arrangements is allocated to various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element of the transaction and is recognized as each element is delivered 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and directly to certain education  consumer  and commercial customers 
the company generally does not require collateral from its customers 
however  when possible  the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in europe  asia  and latin america 
however  considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral  flooring arrangements  or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of the company s distribution channels  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product lifecycle status  product development plans  and component cost trends 
the personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are made 
the company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been canceled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these formal and informal commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees  negatively affecting gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified 
valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles the company reviews property  plant  and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
although the company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property  plant  and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in the company s business in a geographic region or business segment in the future  including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores  could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified 
as of september   the company had million in goodwill 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  the company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that goodwill be allocated to various business units of the company s business to which it relates  the company estimate the fair value of those business units to which the goodwill relates  and the company determine the book value of those business units 
if the estimated fair value of business units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value  the company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those business units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in process research and development and developed technology 
once this process is complete  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  can be determined 
based on the company s estimates as of september   there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  changes in various circumstances including changes in the company s market capitalization  changes in the company s forecasts  and changes in the company s internal business structure could cause one or more of the company s business units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill 
additionally  in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions  the company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of property  plant  and equipment  identifiable intangibles  or goodwill 
valuation of non current debt and equity investments as of september   the company held investments in certain debt and equity securities with a combined carrying value of million 
these investments  which are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non current debt and equity investments  have been categorized as available for sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non current debt and equity investments in two quarters during the last two fiscal years 
various factors are considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  including the length of time and extent to which the investment s market value has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the company s non current debt and equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility 
the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of million related to two of these investments in the fourth quarter of as a result  as of september   the company had no significant unrealized gains or losses recorded against the carrying value of its non current debt and equity investments 
should the fair value of these investments fall below the company s current cost bases and or the financial condition or prospects of either company deteriorate  the company may determine in a future period that such a decline in fair value is other than temporary  requiring an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made 
additional information regarding these investments and potential charges related to their impairment may be found below under the caption factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
net sales net sales and macintosh unit sales for geographic segments and by product follow net sales in millions and macintosh unit sales in thousands change change americas net sales    europe net sales    japan net sales  retail net sales other segments net sales total net sales    americas macintosh unit sales europe macintosh unit sales  japan macintosh unit sales retail macintosh unit sales other segments macintosh unit sales total macintosh unit sales    power macintosh net sales a powerbook net sales imac net sales    ibook net sales software  service  and other net sales  total net sales    power macintosh unit sales a powerbook unit sales imac unit sales    ibook unit sales total macintosh unit sales    net sales per macintosh unit sold b a includes server sales and amounts previously reported as power macintosh g cube 
b based on net sales associated with macintosh units and total macintosh units sold 
net sales increased million or during compared to  while macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year over year at approximately million units 
on a geographic basis  performance in the domestic market was relatively strong  especially when considering the performance of the company s retail segment which currently operates exclusively in the united states 
however  the european and japanese markets remained sluggish throughout the company s net sales in were positively influenced by a number of factors 
first  net sales from software  service  and other sources rose million or in versus this increase was driven by several factors including a increase in combined third party and apple branded software sales  million in net sales of ipod  the company s portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of  a increase in the sale of computer accessories  and a increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts 
the growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third party software in the company s retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of apple branded software titles 
second  overall unit sales of macintosh portable systems grew by  units or in reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable systems 
during  portable macintosh systems represented of total systems sales versus in and in growth in this area has been most pronounced for ibook  the company s education and consumer oriented portable macintosh system 
ibook unit sales increased in and in third  the company s retail segment grew from stores at the end of to stores at the end of the retail segment s net sales grew from million in to million in while the retail segment may cannibalize some net sales from the company s preexisting sales channels in the us  the company does believe that a substantial portion of the retail segment s net sales are incremental to the company s total net sales 
see additional comments below related to the retail segment under the heading segment operating performance 
fourth  the company s average unit pricing remained relatively stable during as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing year over year on comparative macintosh systems 
net sales per macintosh unit sold during of  per unit reflects the shift in mix towards relatively higher priced portable macintosh systems and reflects the impact on net sales of the relatively higher priced new imac design introduced during the impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in unit sales of relatively higher priced power macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative macintosh systems during for most of the company s macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure 
fifth  any comparison of net sales in versus must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of as discussed below  this was attributable to several factors at the beginning of  including continuing deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers  rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the company during that quarter that cost the company approximately million  and a plan implemented by the company during the first quarter of to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately  units during that quarter 
net sales during the first quarter of are discussed in more detail below 
offsetting the favorable factors discussed above  the company s net sales in were negatively impacted by several notable factors 
first  unit sales of power macintosh systems fell during as compared to this followed a decline in power macintosh unit sales in from the company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their power macintosh systems due to the company s ongoing transition to mac os x  its new operating system  and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their macintosh applications to run natively in mac os x 
further  the company did not experience the anticipated increase in power macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of adobe s photoshop during additionally  many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of mac os x jaguar released in the fourth quarter of others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for mac os x such as quarkxpress 
second  despite the overall increase in net sales during in the americas  the company continues to see weakness in its us education channel 
total net sales in this channel fell in and in these declines are consistent with industry data that shows the company losing market share in the us education market in each of the last two fiscal years 
the company believes this weakness has been caused by multiple factors  including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the company s competitors who sell windows based personal computers 
additionally  some of the company s education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding 
the company continues to take steps to address weakness in the us education channel 
however  it is difficult to anticipate how this trend will affect fiscal and to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse 
third  the personal computer industry in general and the company specifically continue to see relatively soft demand for its products 
despite an overall increase in unit sales of consumer oriented macintosh systems during  consumer sales remain far below levels experienced in and earlier 
worsening global economic conditions over the past three years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the company s products in virtually all of its markets 
further  growth in the overall personal computer industry has been slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer  creative  and business personal computer upgrade cycles 
in short  the company believes that expansion in the overall market for personal computers has for the most part stalled and that growth awaits a combination of economic recovery and technological advancements 
net sales decreased billion or during compared to  while macintosh unit sales fell from demand for all of the company s products in all of the company s geographic operating segments was negatively impacted throughout by unfavorable global economic conditions 
on a year over year basis  net sales and macintosh unit sales were down in all of the company s geographic operating segments  and net sales and unit sales by product were down for each macintosh product category except ibook 
in addition to general economic conditions  two other primary factors contributed to the decline in net sales during first  as discussed below  the company executed a plan during the first three quarters of to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels 
as a result of these efforts  the company s macintosh channel inventory fell by approximately  units during the first nine months of second  the company believes that many of its professional users were delaying upgrades of their power macintosh systems due to the company s ongoing transition to mac os x  its new operating system  and in anticipation of software vendors transitioning their mac applications to run natively in mac os x 
several positive factors combined to partially mitigate the overall decline in net sales during the net sales per macintosh unit sold remained relatively strong during after adjusting for the million impact to net sales of the rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the company during the first quarter of  falling only about from the relatively strong per unit sales in reflects somewhat lower year over year pricing on comparative systems  offset by a shift in overall sales mix toward higher priced portable systems 
also  the company experienced very little shift in the mix of overall combined unit sales of relatively lower priced consumer and education macintosh systems  imac and ibook  and their higher priced professionally oriented equivalents 
combined unit sales of imac and ibook systems accounted for of total macintosh unit sales in and in second  combined unit sales of portable systems  ibook and powerbook  actually rose during despite the negative economic climate and the overall decline in unit sales 
not only does this increase in portable system sales reflect a general industry shift toward portable systems  it is also specifically attributable to the strong demand for redesigned ibooks introduced during the third quarter of and for the titanium powerbook g which was introduced during the second quarter of third  a small decline in net sales in the us education market during compared to was partially mitigated by a increase in us education unit sales during first quarter net sales decreased to billion compared to the same quarter in and decreased from the fourth quarter of both the year over year and sequential declines in net sales during the first quarter of were attributable to several factors  including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers and rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the company during the quarter that cost the company approximately million 
in addition  the company implemented a plan during the first quarter to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal to lower levels by the end of the first quarter of the company ended fiscal with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell through of the company s products during the fourth quarter of that year 
the company reduced macintosh channel inventory during the first quarter by approximately  units 
these factors contributed to the year over year decline during the first quarter in total macintosh unit sales that were experienced across the company s entire product line 
these factors also reduced the net sales per macintosh unit sold a function of total net sales associated with macintosh units and total macintosh cpu unit sales during the first quarter of to  a decline of approximately from the same period in segment operating performance the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis 
the company s reportable operating segments include the americas  europe  japan  and retail 
the americas segment includes both north and south america  except for the company s retail segment 
the european segment includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa 
the japan segment includes only japan 
the retail segment operates apple owned retail stores in the united states 
each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services 
further information regarding the company s operating segments may be found in part ii  item on this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note  segment information and geographic data 
americas net sales for the americas segment increased or million in as discussed above  the americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in us education sales in of million 
the americas segment also experienced a decline in power macintosh unit sales 
however  outside of the us education channel  unit sales of consumer desktop and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in  rising a combined in sales of software  peripherals  and accessories were also up in the americas during growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during in the americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of discussed above 
however  growth in the americas was somewhat negatively affected  particularly with respect to consumer oriented systems  by the significant growth of the company s retail segment in the us more than of the retail segment s macintosh unit sales during were for imacs and ibooks 
the americas segment s net sales and unit sales declined and  respectively  from the operating performance of the americas segment for reflects the company s overall performance characterized by significant declines in year over year quarterly net sales and units sales  particularly during the first quarter and particularly in consumer channels  with sequential increases in unit sales and net sales during each of the last three quarters of net sales in the americas segment during were also negatively affected by the company s overall reduction in channel inventories during the year 
consumer sales in the americas were particularly hard hit by current economic conditions 
outside of the us education channel  unit sales of the company s consumer oriented imac fell in the effect of falling consumer demand in the americas segment was partially offset by strong us education sales 
the company s unit sales in us education markets rose in driven by the acceptance of the company s new portable products  particularly the ibook  and reflect a general shift in demand in the us education market towards portable versus desktop systems 
portable systems accounted for of total unit sales in the company s us education market in compared to during during and  the americas segment represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total net sales and represented approximately and  respectively  of total macintosh unit sales 
europe economic conditions in europe remained weak throughout  and the overall demand for the company s products in that region remained flat during versus unit sales in europe for reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer oriented products  particularly ibook whose unit sales increased in  offset by declines in power macintosh unit sales 
net sales in europe fell million or during compared to  while europe s unit sales fell 
europe s results reflect the worsening economic climate in europe in the latter half of and reductions in channel inventories as experienced in the company s other geographic operating segments 
combined unit sales of the company s consumer oriented products in europe were particularly impacted during  falling from japan net sales in japan remained flat during versus  with a slight decline in unit sales of 
consistent with the company s other geographic operating segments  during japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of power macintosh systems 
japan s imac unit sales increased in however  in the case of japan the increase in imac unit shipments in versus was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the company in the first quarter of discussed above 
additionally  net sales in japan on a sequential and year over year comparative basis generally worsened as progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions that currently exist in japan 
net sales and unit sales in japan fell and  respectively  in versus although unit sales and net sales in japan have generally trended upwards as progressed  the japan segment has been particularly affected by current unfavorable economic conditions 
reflecting the continuing harsh consumer climate in japan  the japan segment s combined unit sales of imacs and ibooks during were down from  and professionally oriented systems unit sales fell 
retail by the end of september  the company had retail stores operating in the united states  of which were opened during fiscal the company has opened additional stores during the first quarter of during  approximately of the retail segment s net sales came from the sale of apple branded and third party peripherals and software 
this compares to for the company as a whole 
with an average of stores open  the retail segment achieved average annualized revenue per store during the fourth quarter of approximately million and had approximately million visitors 
the retail segment reported a loss for all of of million  and a loss for the fourth quarter of of million 
expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure  operating lease commitments  personnel  and other operating expenses 
capital expenditures associated with the retail segment totaled million in and million in as of september   the retail segment had employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of million 
the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
investment in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky  particularly in light of the significant investment involved  the current economic climate  and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment s operating expenses 
results for this segment are dependent upon a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed below under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
backlog in the company s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects 
in particular  backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages 
backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply 
because of the foregoing  backlog cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 
further information regarding the company s backlog may be found below under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september  are as follows in millions  except gross margin percentages net sales    cost of sales    gross margin    gross margin percentage gross margin increased to of net sales in from in as discussed below  gross margin in was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of experienced in the first quarter of as a percentage of net sales  the company s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal from in the first quarter down to in the fourth quarter 
this decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry 
the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal in light of weak economic conditions  flat demand for personal computers in general  and the resulting pressure on prices 
the foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in and the general demand for personal computers during are forward looking 
gross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors  including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained  targeted gross margin levels will be achieved  or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services  and potential changes to the company s product mix  including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
gross margin declined to of net sales in from in this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative experienced during the first quarter of compared to gross margin for the same quarter in in addition to lower than normal net sales  first quarter margins were negatively impacted by the rebate programs and price cuts discussed above that decreased revenue by approximately million 
additionally  actual and forecasted declines in net sales caused the company to recognize during the first quarter of approximately million of charges associated with purchase order cancellations and loss commitments for component purchases 
without these charges  gross margin for the first quarter of would have been approximately  and gross margin for all of would have been approximately 
as a percentage of net sales  the company s gross margin increased each quarter as progressed reaching during the fourth quarter 
this pattern reflects the favorable impact during of declining component costs  especially for dram  hard drives  and flat panel screens 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended september  are as follows in millions  except for percentages research and development percentage of net sales selling  general  and administrative expenses    percentage of net sales research and development r d the company recognizes that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
r d expense increased or million to million in as compared to this followed a million or increase in as compared to the overall increase in r d expense over the last two years relates primarily to increased r d headcount and support for new product development activities 
r d spending in also included capitalized software development costs of approximately million associated with the development of mac os x jaguar and approximately million associated with the new powerschool enterprise student information system 
r d spending in also included capitalized software development costs of approximately million associated with the development of the original version of mac os x 
further information related to the company s capitalization of software development costs may be found in part ii  item of this form k at note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a sg a decreased million or during as compared to the decrease in sg a in is primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and advertising expenses  decreased spending related to information systems  and benefits directly related to the company s restructuring actions in and these decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the company s retail segment 
sg a expenditures decreased million or during as compared to declines in sg a spending in both and reflect the company s overall efforts to stabilize and selectively reduce recurring sg a costs in light of lower net sales and to reduce discretionary marketing and advertising expenses 
given current economic conditions and the company s continued strategic investments in new product development and its retail segment  the company is currently identifying additional opportunities to make appropriate reductions in sg a costs 
special charges included in operating expenses special charges included in operating expense for the three fiscal years ended september  are as follows in millions restructuring costs purchased in process research and development executive bonus restructuring actions during fiscal  the company recorded total restructuring charges of million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the company s operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the company s retail operating segment 
once fully implemented  the company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately million 
of the million restructuring charge for fiscal  million was incurred in the fourth quarter of related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its powerschool product strategy 
headcount actions  primarily in corporate operations  sales  and powerschool related research and development  resulted in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide at a cost of million 
the shift in product strategy at powerschool included discontinuing development and marketing of a powerschool product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of million 
the remaining charge in of million was incurred in the first quarter of and will ultimately result in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide  of which were eliminated by september   at a cost of million 
positions were eliminated primarily in the company s operations  information systems  and administrative functions 
in addition  these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the company s information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities 
related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled million  and charges for asset impairments totaled million 
of the total charge in of million  substantially all had been spent by september   except for approximately million related primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases 
restructuring actions during the first quarter of  the company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an million restructuring charge 
this charge was comprised of million for the write off of various operating assets and million for severance payments to approximately employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing functions 
of the million accrued for severance  million had been spent before the end of  and the remainder was spent in of the million accrued for the write off of various assets  substantially all was utilized before the end of purchased in process research and development ipr d during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired emagic gmbh  a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production  for approximately million in cash   of which was allocated to ipr d 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was expensed upon acquisition  because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the ipr d relates primarily to emagic s logic series technology and extensions 
at the date of the acquisition  the products under development were between complete  and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the company s fiscal at a cost of approximately  the remaining efforts include finalizing user interface design and development  and testing 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined by an independent third party valuation using the income approach  which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the ipr d projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology  and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
in may  the company acquired powerschool  inc powerschool  a provider of web based student information systems for k schools and districts that enables schools to record  access  report  and manage their student data and performance in real time  and gives parents real time web access to track their children s progress 
of total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to ipr d and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the ipr d relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design  develop  and deploy a functioning  scalable web based student information system for use by k schools 
at the date of the acquisition  the powerschool product under development was approximately complete  and it was expected that the remaining would be completed during the company s fiscal at a cost of approximately million 
the remaining efforts  which were completed during  included completion of coding  finalizing user interface design and development  and testing 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined by an independent third party valuation using the income approach  which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the ipr d projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology  and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
executive bonus during the first quarter of  the company s board of directors approved a special executive bonus for the company s chief executive officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of approximately million  the majority of which was not tax deductible 
approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft 
the other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus

interest and other income  net net interest and other income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this million or decrease is primarily the result of declining investment yields on the company s cash and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments fell to in compared to in net interest and other income increased million or to million during the increase was due in part to interest income from higher cash and invested balances in  partially offset by declining interest rates and investment yields  and a rebalancing of the aggregate investment portfolio to a higher proportion of lower risk and better credit investments

the company s expects this decline to be most pronounced in the second half of the fiscal year 
the foregoing statements are forward looking 
interest and other income  net could differ from expected levels because of several factors  including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
additionally  actual future interest and other income  net may be significantly impacted by unforeseen changes in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and the fair value of the company s short term and long term investments

management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the first quarter of its fiscal management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the first quarter of its fiscal management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs associated with a restructuring and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management is committed to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities  and may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs  as well as the amounts recognized

these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods ranging from to months 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
as of september   the company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately million

factors that may affect future results and financial condition because of the following factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the company 
the company s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
for much of the past years  demand for the company s products has been negatively impacted by worsening global economic conditions 
continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results 
should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  demand for the company s products could continue to be adversely affected  as could the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
the terrorist attacks that took place on september   disrupted commerce throughout the world and created many economic and political uncertainties that have had a strong negative impact on the global economy 
the long term effects of the september  attacks on the company s future operating results and financial condition remain unknown 
the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  the potential for future terrorist attacks and other acts of hostility  and the potential for war in the middle east have created economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
the market for personal computers is highly competitive 
the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
over the past several years  price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense 
the company s competitors who sell windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing products that began in the second half of calendar the company s results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality  hardware performance  and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
further  as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet  an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company s existing products 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including consumer  education  professional and consumer digital video editing  and design and publishing 
additionally  several of the company s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design  technical features  and solutions of the company s products 
the company has many substantial competitors  many of whom have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
additionally  there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the company s markets 
the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing microsoft s windows operating systems 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms  including windows 
the company has higher research and development and selling  general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenues  than many of competitors 
the company s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technology to the marketplace 
as a result  the company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell windows based personal computers 
many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures 
further  as a result of the expansion of the company s retail segment and costs associated with marketing the company s brand including its unique operating system  the company incurs higher selling costs as a percent of revenue than many of its competitors 
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins  its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure 
the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 
due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
during  the company introduced a new client operating system  mac os x  and delivered its first major upgrade  mac os x version during  the company delivered another major upgrade  mac os x jaguar 
inability of the company to improve the performance and functionality of mac os x  advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades  or obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on mac os x or create new applications to run on mac os x  may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
because orders for components  and in some cases commitments to purchase components  must be placed in advance of customer orders  the company faces substantial inventory risk 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry  no assurance can be given the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may again have  a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
consistent with industry practice  components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
future operating results are dependent upon the company s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components  some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources 
although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  certain key components including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources 
some key components including without limitation dram  tft lcd flat panel displays  and optical and magnetic disk drives  while currently available to the company from multiple sources  are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
in addition  new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for  and subsequently qualifies  additional suppliers 
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and motorola  the sole suppliers of the powerpc risc based microprocessor for the company s macintosh computers  to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the windows operating systems 
further  despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary  the company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by windows based systems and translates to slower overall system performance 
there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the company s suppliers to provide advanced g and g microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
the inability in the future of the company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price performance features could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the united states 
many of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
in addition  the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
final assembly of products sold by the company is conducted in the company s manufacturing facilities in sacramento  california  and cork  ireland  and by external vendors in fullerton  california  taiwan  korea  the people s republic of china  and the czech republic 
currently  manufacture of many of the components used in the company s products and final assembly of all of the company s portable products including powerbooks  ibooks  and the ipod is performed by third party vendors in taiwan 
if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic  business  environmental  political  or military conditions or events  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s products could experience quality problems that result in decreased net sales and operating profits 
the company sells highly complex hardware and software products that may contain defects in design and manufacture 
sophisticated operating system software and applications such as the company sells often contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software 
defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties that may be beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells 
failure to do so could result in lost revenues  loss of reputation  and significant expense to remedy 
the company s retail initiative requires a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
since may of  the company has opened retail stores in the united states and anticipates opening more stores in calendar the company s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  information systems  inventory  and personnel 
the company has also entered into substantial operating leases commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from to years 
the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  a relatively high proportion of the retail segment s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store constructions costs and lease expense 
as a result  should the retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason  significant losses would result 
certain of the company s stores have been intentionally designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing  corporate events  and brand awareness 
because of their unique design elements  locations and size  these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the company s typical retail stores 
the company has opened two such stores and has several others under development 
because of their location and size  these high profile stores also require the company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores 
current leases on such locations have terms ranging from to years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from million to million 
closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
many of the general risks and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its retail segment 
also  many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control  that could adversely affect the retail segment s future results  cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected  and or have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include  among other things  macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity  inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation  lack of consumer acceptance of the company s retail approach  failure to attract new users to the macintosh platform  inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins  failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners  lack of experience in managing retail operations  costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of apple branded and third party retail inventory  and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost 
unit sales of the company s professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over past two to three years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin 
unit sales of power macintosh systems fell during as compared to and fell in from power macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total macintosh unit sales from in to in the company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of such systems 
the company also believes that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their power macintosh systems due to the company s ongoing transition to mac os x and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented macintosh software applications to run natively in mac os x 
in addition to the negative impact on net sales  declining sales of power macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the company s overall gross margin because power macintosh systems are generally higher priced and have higher individual gross margins than the company s other macintosh systems 
continued deterioration in power macintosh unit sales will adversely affect the company s future net sales and gross margin 
if future unit sales of power macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover  it will be difficult for the company to improve its overall profitability 
the company faces increasing competition in the us education market 
sales in the united states to both elementary and secondary schools  as well as for college and university customers  remains a core market for apple 
net sales in these markets fell to of the company s total net sales in from in this drop reflects declines in both net sales and macintosh unit sales in these markets of and  respectively  in fiscal compared to these developments are consistent with industry data showing the company losing market share in the us education market in each of the last two fiscal years 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers 
although the company has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain its existing share of that market 
failure to increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the company s products 
the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers and cataloguers  many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers 
in addition  the company also sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users  certain education customers  and certain resellers through its online stores around the world 
the company also sells its own products and certain third party products through its retail stores in the united states 
many of the company s significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions 
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased 
historically  the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada  and certain parts of asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weaknesses in foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and the euro  can adversely impact consumer demand for the company s products and the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales 
conversely  strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the company of product components  negatively affecting the company s results of operations 
margins on sales of apple products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including tariffs and antidumping penalties

the company s future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers 
the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as microsoft office 
the company also believes the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  acceptance by customers of mac os x  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market  as well as the company s decision to end its mac os licensing program  have caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
in addition  past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company s products 
moreover  there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x  the company s new operating system  on a timely basis or at all 
in august  the company and microsoft corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements 
in addition  for a period of five years through august  and subject to certain limitations related to the number of macintosh computers sold by the company  microsoft was required to make versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products for the mac os 
although microsoft has released microsoft office and internet explorer for mac os x  microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to august while the company believes its relationship with microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the mac os  the company does compete directly with microsoft in a number of key areas 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the mac os following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating system 
discontinuance of microsoft office and other microsoft products for the macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
the company s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties  and the company s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods  the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms 
because of technological changes in the computer industry  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others 
the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in significant expenses  and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel 
several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation 
the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases 
however  no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party  the company s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected 
information regarding claims and potential litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in part i  item of this form k 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  or financial condition 
however  the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in part i  item of this form k or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
the company expects its quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
the company s profit margins vary among its products  its geographic markets  and its distribution channels 
as a result  the overall profitability of the company in any given period will depend  in part  on the product  geographic  and channel mix reflected in that period s net sales 
the typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the company s fiscal quarters can adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months  a pattern typical in the personal computer industry 
this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics or components suppliers  can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 
the company s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where the majority of the company s employees are located 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in the company s stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees 
as of september   a substantial majority of the company s outstanding employee stock options were out of the money 
the company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance 
the company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance 
such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs  higher policy deductibles  and lower coverage limits 
for some risks  because of cost and or availability  the company does not have insurance coverage 
for these reasons  the company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost 
the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables 
this risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen 
the company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company also has non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables  there can be assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses 
additionally  if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  it becomes more likely that the company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors 
the market value of the company s non current debt and equity investments is subject to significant volatility 
the company holds minority investments in several public companies with a combined fair market value of approximately million as of september  these investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility 
the company has categorized its investments in these companies as available for sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non current debt and equity investments twice in the last two fiscal years 
the company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement that the company provide consumers with the ability to return to the company product at the end of its useful life  and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws  there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the parliament of the european union is working on finalizing the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the directive 
the directive makes producers of electrical goods  including personal computers  financially responsible for the collection  recycling  and safe disposal of past and future products 
the directive must now be approved and implemented by individual european union governments by june  while the producers financial obligations are scheduled to start june the company s potential liability resulting from the directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial 
however  because it is likely that specific laws  regulations  and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual european member states  it is not currently possible to estimate the company s existing liability or future expenses resulting from the directive 
as the european union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the directive  the company will continue to assess its potential financial impact 
similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies  including federal and state legislation in the united states  the cumulative impact of which could be significant 
business interruptions could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  labor disputes  and other events beyond its control 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations  including certain major components suppliers and manufacturing vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 
unanticipated changes in the company s tax rates could affect its future results 
the company s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of the company deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
the company s stock price may be volatile 
the company s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock in the future 
item a 
disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non hedge portfolios  the company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge  there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as of october  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities  and exposure definition 
management does not believe that ongoing application of sfas no 
will significantly alter the company s hedging strategies 
however  its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment 
the company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio 
the external managers adhere to the company s investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process 
during  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the sec 
the notes were sold at of par  for an effective yield to maturity of 
the notes pay interest semiannually and mature on february  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and long term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments 
the company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents  highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments 
as of september   billion of the company s investment portfolio classified as short term investments was invested in us agency and corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from to years 
as of september   million of the company s investment portfolio classified as short term investments was in us agency securities with underlying maturities ranging from to years 
the remainder all had underlying maturities between and months 
due to liquidity needs  or in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for the purpose of duration management of the company s investment portfolio  the company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities 
as a result of such activity  the company recognized net gains of million in and million in in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million decline in fair value 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
except in instances noted above  the company s policy is to hold investments to maturity 
the company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions  including interest rate swaps  collars  and floors  with financial institutions in order to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt  and or to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
the company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program 
during the last two years  the company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt  and or to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
the interest rate swaps  which qualified as accounting hedges  generally required the company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month us dollar libor and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts 
these swaps effectively converted the company s fixed rate year debt to floating rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate 
due to prevailing market interest rates  during the company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of million 
during the company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of million 
both the gains in and were deferred  recognized in long term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt 
at certain times in the past  the company has also entered into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program 
the company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management 
the company s asset swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with associated gains and losses recorded in interest and other income 
interest rate asset swaps outstanding as of september   had a weighted average receive rate of and a weighted average pay rate of 
the unrealized loss on these assets swaps as of september   of million was deferred and then recognized in income in as part of the sfas no 
transition adjustment effective on october  the company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during realizing a gain of million 
foreign currency risk overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  and probable but not firmly committed transactions 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures 
however  the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate of hedging instruments 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries 
in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate random market price paths 
the value at risk is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual gains and losses in the future associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
