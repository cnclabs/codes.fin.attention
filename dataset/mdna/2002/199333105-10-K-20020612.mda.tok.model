item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve work station and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current size and leadership position largely as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april these acquisitions have significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
as a result of these acquisitions and internal growth  our revenues have increased from approximately million in fiscal  the year of our initial public offering  to approximately million in fiscal the operations of our acquired businesses have been substantially integrated with our existing businesses 
we converted nearly all of our acquired north american businesses onto our computer system which integrates all of our applications from order entry to production planning to accounting  facilitating company wide information flow 
further acquisition integration activities included cost reductions resulting from internally supplying chain and forged attachments to acquired hoist businesses we ve acquired  consolidating purchasing efforts through our purchasing council  reducing duplicative sales and marketing activities  eliminating administrative headcount and consolidating treasury and accounts receivable functions 
our acquisition integration activities also included revenue enhancements through cross selling of products between existing and acquired businesses 
the next phase of the integration of these businesses includes reducing our excess manufacturing capacity and improving our productivity 
this phase is currently in progress through our facility rationalization program and lean manufacturing efforts 
the latter phase of these integration activities was delayed for a period of approximately two years  from early through early  due to difficulties encountered with the assimilation of our asi acquisition 
substantially all of the assets of that business  which formerly comprised our solutions automotive segment  were sold in may asi did not prove to be a good fit for us mainly because of the highly volatile nature of its business  its significant dependence on the auto industry and its heavy use of working capital 
despite the fact that the write off associated with that disposition increased our financial leverage  the proceeds furthered our efforts to reduce debt and future interest expense  which has recently been one of our primary objectives 
many of the us industrial sectors that we serve have been impacted by soft economic conditions since mid these conditions deteriorated significantly in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued to decline throughout fiscal  impacting our net sales and financial performance 
after reaching a historical high of million in fiscal  our net sales declined to million in fiscal  and further by to million in fiscal  primarily due to this downturn in the business cycle 
despite these economic conditions and their impact on our operating results  we maintained our leading market share  generated positive cash flow from operations and repaid million and million of debt in fiscal and  respectively 
our positive cash flow was favorably impacted by our lean manufacturing efforts  which began in fiscal these efforts are fundamentally changing our manufacturing processes  resulting in significant inventory reductions 
results of operations net sales of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and with percentage changes for each segment  were as follows change change fiscal years ended march  vs 
vs 
amount amount products segment solutions segment total net sales sales fluctuations during the periods were primarily due to the downturn in the general economy and the industrial sectors in particular 
net sales in fiscal of million decreased by million  or  from fiscal  and sales in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal our products segment net sales declined and in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to decreased unit sales resulting from the soft us industrial markets 
our solutions segment net sales decreased and increased in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to soft us industrial markets and our decision to exit our domestic general contracting business  which had net sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the growth in fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of our european operations  partially offset by soft us industrial markets 
gross profit of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total segment net sales  were as follows fiscal years ended march  amount amount amount products segment solutions segment total gross profit our gross profit margins were approximately  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit margin for fiscal and were primarily the result of the significant decline in net sales over the years presented and the resulting decrease in absorption of fixed production costs  partially offset by discretionary cost control measures 
the gross profit margin in our products segment decreased in fiscal due to the decrease in net sales and resulting decrease in production cost absorption  the lack of a general price increase to offset inflationary costs especially insurance costs  and a million reclassification of certain crane builder expenses to cost of products sold from general and administrative expenses in fiscal despite soft industrial markets  increasing energy costs and a million reclassification of certain crane builder expenses to cost of products sold from general and administrative expenses in fiscal  the gross profit margin in the products segment increased in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from our cost control efforts and the integration of acquisitions 
the gross profit margin in our solutions segment increased in fiscal despite the decrease in net sales and the resulting decrease in production cost absorption 
this decrease was primarily attributable to weak margins in fiscal the solutions segment s gross profit margin decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of relatively low sales volumes in soft us industrial markets and increasing energy costs 
additionally  our margins were adversely impacted by unprofitable operations in our general contracting business  a service we no longer provide  and operational inefficiencies at one of our european facilities that was consolidated 
selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and reductions reflect cost control efforts due to soft economic conditions as well as the variable nature of some expenses  particularly commissions  travel expenses and sales office costs 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the expense reductions resulted from cost control measures and the reclassification of million and million of crane builder expenses into cost of products sold in fiscal and  respectively  partially offset by sales office expansions into new geographic regions and the expenses associated with our strategic alternatives evaluation in fiscal restructuring charges of million  or of net sales  in fiscal were attributable to the closure of manufacturing facilities in fiscal we anticipate that our restructuring charges for fiscal in connection with our ongoing facility rationalization initiative will be between million to million 
amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  relating primarily to non tax deductible goodwill amortization 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease was the result of a paydown of senior bank debt of million and a reduction in interest rates 
the fiscal increase was primarily the result of increased interest rates 
other income and expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the expense in fiscal included an unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized on certain marketable equity securities held by our captive insurance subsidiary  a loss on the january sale of a small subsidiary  and a gain on the sale of assets held for sale 
the remaining fluctuations were due to the sale of marketable securities by our captive insurance subsidiary for settlement of a portion of our general and products liability claims 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not meaningful in fiscal and were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the percentages reflected the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from business acquisitions  offset by the impact of tax credits and other tax items 
as a result of the above  income loss from continuing operations was  and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our existing bank credit agreement  as recently amended  provides availability up to million and matures on march  since the expiration date is within one year from the balance sheet date in our current financial statements  outstanding balances are classified as current liabilities in our march  consolidated balance sheet 
at march   million was outstanding under our bank credit agreement 
subsequently  million of proceeds resulting from the may  sale of substantially all of the assets of asi were applied to further reduce the outstanding balance 
the recent amendment also waived and modified certain financial covenants 
interest is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio  amounting to basis points at may  our obligations under the bank credit agreement are secured by all equipment  inventory  receivables  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
our senior subordinated notes issued on march  amounted to million  net of original issue discount of million  and are due march  interest is payable semi annually based on an effective rate of  considering million of proceeds from rate hedging in advance of the placement 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales and dividends and other restricted payments 
prior to april   the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
on or after april   they are redeemable at prices declining annually from to on and after april  in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires companies to carry all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
our use of derivative instruments is limited to cash flow hedges  as defined in sfas no 
 of certain interest rate risks 
in order to provide interest rate risk protection we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in june  to effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the million interest rate swap agreement matures in june net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal was the result of a reduction in working capital components  especially inventory  despite decreased income from continuing operations 
the million decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of an increase in net working capital components and deferred income taxes 
operating assets net of liabilities provided cash of million in fiscal  used cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and amounts included million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sale of a portion of land included in net assets held for sale 
the fiscal amount included the acquisition of weco for million 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
those amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment as well as million  million and million of dividends paid in fiscal  and  respectively 
our existing bank credit agreement terminates on march  and if we are unable to enter into a new bank credit agreement prior to such termination  our ability to fund our operations will be significantly impaired 
we have received a term sheet for a new bank credit agreement that provides for borrowings up to million and will mature in however  the term sheet is not binding on the lenders  and we may not be able to negotiate this agreement on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we anticipate the closing of the new bank credit agreement will occur prior to the termination of our existing bank credit agreement 
we believe that the reduced availability of million contemplated under the term sheet  will be  together with cash on hand  cash provided by operations and cash provided by the future sales of securities  sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe our history of positive cash flow and the assets we have available as collateral will help us finalize a new bank credit agreement 
as proposed in the term sheet  our new bank credit agreement would result in a decrease in the interest rate of our bank debt 
borrowings under our new bank credit agreement will be secured by a first priority security interest in all of our personal property  mortgages on certain of our real property and a pledge of the capital stock of our subsidiaries limited to for our foreign subsidiaries  and will contain covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to sell a substantial portion of our assets  to merge or to make acquisitions or investments 
it will also obligate us to meet certain financial requirements and will restrict our ability to pay dividends 
we were in default of certain financial covenants under our existing bank credit agreement as of march  we have obtained a waiver of the defaults along with an amendment that modifies certain covenants prospectively 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
further  our facility rationalization program currently in progress reduces our annual capital expenditure requirements and also provides for transfers of equipment from the rationalized facilities to other operating facilities 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased spending in fiscal reflects a deferral of certain projects due to soft market conditions as well as reduced needs resulting from our facility rationalization program 
the increased spending in fiscal was the result of our decision to purchase real estate that was previously leased 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico and the pacific rim 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through price increases 
we did not implement a general price increase in fiscal due to the soft economic conditions 
in the future  there can be no assurance that our business will not be further affected by inflation or that we will be able to pass on cost increases 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges attributable to our facility rationalization program  acquisitions and the magnitude of acquisition integration costs 
therefore  the operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included cash of million and an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
we may also receive additional payments of up to million from the proceeds of certain designated receivables and up to million over the next two years based on the financial performance of the asi business 
accordingly  the asi operation was reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements and prior periods have been restated 
the income loss from discontinued operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fluctuations were primarily due to the volatility of the automobile industry and the asi operation s dependence on certain significant customers 
the loss on the sale of the discontinued operations was million and was reflected in our fiscal statement of operations 
cash used by discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and provided by discontinued operations was million in fiscal the net current assets of discontinued operations of million were reflected on the march  balance sheet 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plants and equipment and goodwill and other intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
effects of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations in june sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method 
the elimination of the pooling of interests method is effective for transactions initiated after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in june of sfas no 
eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life and the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
will apply to goodwill and intangible assets arising from transactions completed before and after the effective date 
this statement  which will be effective for our fiscal year beginning on april   must be adopted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are currently assessing the statement and the impact that adoption will have on our fiscal consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption  we will stop amortizing goodwill which  based upon current levels of goodwill for continuing operations  would reduce amortization expense by approximately million on an annual basis 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations in june sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement  which is effective for our fiscal year beginning april   may be adopted as of april  we are currently assessing the statement and the impact  if any  that adoption will have on our fiscal consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in august sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement  while retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 changes the criteria to be met to classify an asset as held for sale as well as the grouping of long lived assets and liabilities that represent the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning april  we are currently assessing the statement and the impact  if any  that adoption will have on our fiscal consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting our operating results the success of our business is affected by industrial economic conditions 
periods of industrial economic slowdown or recession in the united states or other countries  or the public perception that one may occur  could decrease the demand for our products  affect the availability and cost of our products and adversely impact our business 
in fiscal  for example  we were negatively impacted by the general slowing in the economy 
that impact has continued  and in fiscal we experienced a loss 
our significant indebtedness could limit our operational and financial flexibility 
we have incurred indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
as of march   we had total funded debt of approximately million 
this represents approximately of our total capitalization at that date 
we may need to incur additional debt to fund our continued growth 
we may not be able to service or refinance our debt at maturity on terms that are acceptable to us 
our debt service  consisting of interest expense and required principal payments  was million in fiscal the degree to which we are leveraged could have other important consequences to holders of our common stock  including the following o we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  which reduces the funds available for our operations  o a portion of our debt is at variable rates of interest  which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  for example  interest expense in fiscal would have increased million for every percentage point increase in interest rates  based upon average variable rate debt outstanding  and o our debt instruments contain numerous financial and other restrictive covenants  such as restrictions on paying dividends  incurring additional debt  selling assets and making capital expenditures 
our existing bank credit agreement  which had outstanding borrowings of million at march   terminates on march  we have received a term sheet for a new bank credit agreement providing for aggregate borrowings up to million that we anticipate the closing of the new bank credit agreement will occur prior to the termination of our existing bank credit agreement 
however  the term sheet is not binding on the lenders  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate this agreement on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
for instance  a new bank credit agreement could result in an increase in the interest rate of our bank debt over the rate we currently pay or more restrictive covenants than our existing bank credit agreement currently contains 
if we are unable to enter into a new bank credit agreement by march   our ability to fund our operations will be significantly impaired 
a write off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth and cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit agreement 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
fas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill should be amortized over their useful lives 
as a result of our prior acquisitions  we have a material amount of goodwill recorded on our financial statements 
at march  our recorded goodwill was approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we may have to write off all or a portion of our goodwill if its value becomes impaired 
although any such write off would be a non cash charge  it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly 
a write off of goodwill could also cause us to violate covenants contained in our bank credit agreement that require a minimum level of net worth 
any such violation could disqualify us from making additional borrowings under our bank credit agreement and could require us to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies 
historically  a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions 
our acquired companies have and will continue to place significant demands on our management  operational and financial resources 
realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the acquired companies sales and marketing  distribution  manufacturing  engineering  finance and administrative organizations 
the integration of our acquired companies will continue to demand substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired companies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies  that these companies will operate profitably or that we will realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions 
we may be adversely impacted by our inability to identify and finance future acquisitions 
although we have not made any acquisitions since april  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions again in the future 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify appropriate future acquisition candidates or  if we do  that we will be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition  finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired business effectively and profitably into our existing operations 
consummating an acquisition could require us to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing 
additional equity financing could depress the market price of our common stock 
additional debt financing could require us to accept covenants that would  among other things  limit our ability to pay dividends 
our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have operations and assets located outside of the united states  primarily in canada  mexico  germany  denmark  france and china 
in addition  we import a portion of our hoist product line from china and japan  and sell our products to distributors located in approximately countries 
our international operations are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  risk of governmental expropriation  political risks and risks of increases in taxes 
also  in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met 
these factors may adversely affect our future profits 
our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our income and profitability 
the principal markets that we serve are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on performance  functionality  price  brand recognition  customer service and support  and product availability 
our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could reduce our gross margins and net income 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and rights agreement  as well as the new york business corporation law  contain provisions that could have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and applicable new york law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control that shareholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws will o authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval  o regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders  and o limit the right of shareholders to remove a director 
our rights agreement and applicable provisions of new york law impose limitations on persons proposing to acquire us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel prices 
we may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
the principal raw material used in our specialty chain and forging operations is steel 
the steel industry as a whole is very cyclical  and at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  labor costs  competition  import duties  tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs 
through our purchasing council  we purchase steel on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices and market conditions 
in an environment of increasing raw material prices  competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on any price increases to our customers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel 
we are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost 
our facilities are subject to many federal  state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment and we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with such provisions 
failure to comply with environmental laws  regulations and permits  or changes in such laws  including the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance and could also include fines and civil and criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  clean up costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years and  over time  we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
environmental liabilities could exist  including clean up obligations at these or other locations where materials from our operations were disposed of  which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  canada  germany  denmark  the united kingdom  mexico  france and china and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese renminbi 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions 
at march   we had one interest rate swap agreement in effect which converts million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in june we do not have any other swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
including the effect of our existing swap agreement  at march   approximately of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
at that date  we had approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million
