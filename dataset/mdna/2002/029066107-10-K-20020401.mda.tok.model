item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth our net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  marketing  selling  general  and administrative expenses  r d expenses  operating income  other income  earnings before income taxes  and net income  expressed as a percentage of net sales  for the years ended december   and net sales cost of goods sold gross profit marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses special charges research and development operating income other income  net 
earnings before income taxes net income revenues net sales in fiscal year decreased by to  million from  million in fiscal year which was higher than  million in fiscal year net sales in and included sales attributable to acquisitions  also refer to acquisitions below 
our fiscal year net revenue continued to be impacted by softness in it and communications market segments with general it spending and growth in core technology applications  such as pcs  down year over year 
our small systems business  which provides power protection  uninterruptible power supply ups  and management products for the pc  server  and local area networking markets  was negatively impacted in fiscal years and by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
the rate of growth in the large systems segment  consisting primarily of ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications  was negatively impacted in fiscal year by the significant reduction in corporate investment for these types of applications  particularly in the second half of this negative impact was partially offset by the inclusion of incremental revenue activity for fiscal year attributable to the acquisitions of advance power and networkair  formerly airflow company  which were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the large systems segment experienced healthy growth in fiscal year  driven by the build out of data centers and share gains in the phase ups market as well as the acquisition of dc power and precision cooling products 
apc experienced strong demand for its products across all solution applications in despite decreased net sales in  sales of products introduced in have contributed to overall net sales and represented approximately   and of net sales in  and  respectively 
foreign sales to unaffiliated customers  primarily in europe  the far east  canada  and south america  in fiscal year were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year also refer to note to notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of net sales  approximately basis points lower than in fiscal year  for fiscal year  gross margins were of net sales  approximately basis points lower than in fiscal year the gross margin erosions were associated with product mix shifts to lower margin products  principally the continued growth of our lower gross margin large system segment  the effect of pro active consumer product price cuts in and  and manufacturing inefficiencies from continued global capacity expansion prior to our capacity rationalization efforts during the second half of additionally  gross margins included the effects of third quarter charges for excess inventory of million and restructuring costs of million  principally associated with the large systems segment 
these charges were the result of events or assessments that occurred during the third quarter of the charge for excess inventory related to specifically identified finished goods and raw materials inventories 
there were no additional inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during the fourth quarter of approximately million of inventories included in the third quarter charge were physically disposed during the fourth quarter 
disposition of the remaining inventories has continued into early  we anticipate that all excess inventory will be physically disposed by no later than the end of the first half of the restructuring costs were associated with manufacturing downsizing actions in denmark and the uk and included the effects of employee terminations  facilities closures  and the related impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
these actions were announced and substantially completed in the third quarter of we anticipate the final settlements of our restructuring actions to be completed by no later than the end of the first half of we expect to generate significant employment cost savings as a result of our restructuring actions 
due to the timing of the facilities closures and contractual or regulatory obligations to certain workers  the financial benefits of these actions did not commence until the fourth quarter of and will continue to phase in gradually during the first half of also refer to note to notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
total inventory reserves at december  were million compared to million at december  this increase was due primarily to the aforementioned charge for excess inventory as well as routine provisioning throughout the year 
apc s reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
apc maintains an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
segment results also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for important information regarding apc s reportable segments while we experienced increased unit volumes during fiscal  net sales for products in the small systems segment  which provides power protection  ups  and management products for the pc  server  and local area networking markets  decreased in fiscal year by from the prior year  while small systems net sales increased in fiscal year by over the prior year 
the overall decrease in and the decline in the rate of growth during were impacted by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
profits for the small systems segment declined in from comparable levels in as a result of pro active price reductions in combined with a mix shift within the segment toward lower margin products 
profits for this segment remained relatively stable during as a percentage of net sales in spite of declining sales growth and pro active price reductions during  principally due to transitioning the manufacture of certain products to lower cost facilities 
net sales for products in the large systems segment  consisting primarily of ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications  increased and over the prior years in and  respectively 
the rate of growth during fiscal year was negatively impacted by the significant reduction in corporate investment for these types of applications  particularly in the second half of the large systems segment experienced healthy growth in fiscal year driven by the build out of data centers and share gains in the phase ups market with our silcon products  as well as the acquisition of dc power and precision cooling products 
profits for this segment have declined due to cost inefficiencies resulting from continued global capacity expansion  coupled with declining sales volumes  particularly in the second half of additionally  profits were negatively impacted by continued investment in product and business development initiatives for this business segment in fiscal year  as well as the restructuring costs discussed above associated with manufacturing downsizing actions in denmark and the uk which included the effects of employee terminations  facilities closures  and the related impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
operating expenses marketing  selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year total spending in approximated levels in due to focused efforts to control expenses while improving the productivity and efficiency of our global resources 
spending rose due to increased investment in sales personnel and distribution costs as well as increased investment in it support 
these increases were substantially offset by reduced spending on administrative support 
the increase in total spending in was due primarily to continued investments in building our sales capabilities  including a global relational sales organization 
during the third and second quarters of  we agreed to license worldwide patent rights relating to uninterruptible power supply technology for lump sum cash payments of million and million  respectively 
these license fees were paid from operating cash during the third and second quarters of apc evaluated the portion of the license fees that represented payment for prior use of the subject technology and the portion that represented payment for future use 
considering each of our markets and the historical and projected revenue realized in markets utilizing the licensed technology  we estimated the present value of royalty payments  basing this calculation on an appropriate royalty rate and the technology s contribution to the overall value of affected products 
separate present values were calculated for both historic and projected product sales  the historic values were expensed and the projected values were capitalized 
accordingly  write offs of the fully paid up portions of the patent licenses were recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the third and second quarters of as special charges to pre tax earnings of million and million  respectively  including direct expenses of million and million  respectively 
the remaining balances of million and million have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as long term assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years and nine years  respectively  the estimated remaining economic lives of the patent licenses 
the allowance for bad debts was of gross accounts receivable at december  compared to at december  accounts receivable balances outstanding over days represented of total receivables at december  compared to at december  this increase reflects in part a growing portion of our business originating in areas where longer payment terms are customary  including a growing contribution from international markets  as well as the product mix shift towards large systems business  which typically carries longer sales cycles and collection cycles 
in addition  we have experienced slower payment cycles as a result of what we believe is tighter fiscal management by our customers during the recent macro economic downturn 
we continue to experience strong collection performance 
write offs of uncollectable accounts represent less than of net sales 
a majority of international customer balances are covered by receivables insurance 
r d expenditures were million or of net sales in fiscal year  million or of net sales in fiscal year  and million or of net sales in fiscal year the increases in total r d spending primarily reflects increased numbers of software and hardware engineers and other costs associated with new product development and engineering support  combined with incremental costs attributable to advance power and networkair  formerly airflow company  which were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
other income  net and income taxes other income is comprised principally of interest income combined with a million gain in fiscal year on the sale of a building in billerica  massachusetts 
although interest income increased substantially from to due to higher average cash balances available for investment during  interest income decreased substantially from to due to lower short term interest rates during our effective income tax rates were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is due to the tax savings from an increasing portion of taxable earnings being generated from apc s operations in jurisdictions currently having lower income tax rates than the present us statutory income tax rate 
effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on apc s operations 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  apc has been able to increase its working capital position as the result of continued positive operating results and despite internally financing the capital investment required to expand its operations 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments position increased to million at december  from million at december  worldwide inventories were million at december   up from million at december  like many other vendors participating in the communications and internet infrastructure build out  apc has been impacted by the rapid decline in forecasted demands during and late apc has also experienced shipment cancellations and rescheduled sales orders from customers in the telecommunications and service provider industry  while our global capacity expansion and rebalancing in our large systems business drove the need for additional safety stock 
additionally  apc s third quarter results include the effects of a charge for excess inventory that totaled million relating to specifically identified finished goods and materials inventories 
the inventories subject to the write off are categorized as follows million of residual  unusable quantities located at facilities impacted by recent downsizing actions  million of unusable or unsaleable quantities related to declining and changing demand requirements  and million of custom finished goods impacted by canceled sales orders  primarily from customers in the telecom and internet infrastructure industries 
there were no additional inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during the fourth quarter of approximately million of inventories included in the third quarter charge were physically disposed during the fourth quarter 
disposition of the remaining inventories has continued into early and we anticipate that all excess inventory will be physically disposed by no later than the end of the first half of inventory levels as a percentage of quarterly sales were in the fourth quarter of  unchanged from in the third quarter of and up from in the fourth quarter of at december   we had million available for future borrowings under an unsecured line of credit agreement at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s cost of funds rate plus 
and an additional million under unsecured line of credit agreements with a second and third bank at similar interest rates 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december  apc had no significant financial commitments  other than those required in the normal course of business  at december  apc has several non cancelable operating leases  primarily for warehousing and office space  expiring at various dates through these leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to nine years and require apc to pay its proportionate share of utilities  taxes  and insurance 
future minimum lease payments under these non cancelable leases are million  million  million  million  million  and million thereafter 
during and  our capital expenditures  net of capital grants  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of manufacturing and office equipment  buildings and improvements  and purchased software applications 
the nature and level of capital spending was made to improve manufacturing capabilities  principally in brazil and india  as well as to fund it related capital equipment and software purchases to support business process improvement initiatives 
capital spending included large systems segment global capacity expansion into lower cost locations closer to local end user customers and markets 
substantially all of apc s net capital expenditures were financed from available operating cash 
we had no material capital commitments at december  apc has agreements with the industrial development authority of ireland  otherwise known as the ida 
under these agreements  we receive grant monies for costs incurred for machinery  equipment  and building improvements for our galway and castlebar facilities 
these grants are equal to and  respectively  of such costs up to a maximum of million for galway and million for castlebar 
such grant monies are subject to apc meeting certain employment goals and maintaining operations in ireland until termination of the respective agreements 
under separate agreements with the ida  we receive direct reimbursement of training costs at our galway and castlebar facilities for up to  and  respectively  per new employee hired 
also refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
during the first quarter of  we announced global headcount reductions of approximately 
these actions impact personnel worldwide throughout a broad range of functions within the organization 
the majority of these terminations are the result of our recent decision to consolidate apc s philippines based manufacturing operations resulting in the closing of apc s manufacturing facility in the province of laguna 
these actions have been and are being implemented during the first half of we anticipate annualized employment cost savings of approximately million 
we believe that current internal cash flows together with available cash  available credit facilities or  if needed  the proceeds from the sale of additional equity  will be sufficient to support anticipated capital spending and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
acquisitions airflow in the fourth quarter of  we acquired privately held airflow company  a maryland based manufacturer of precision cooling equipment primarily used in data center  internet  and telecommunications applications 
for airflow company we paid million in cash plus expenses  of which million will be paid at scheduled dates over three years in the event no indemnity claims arise 
our cash outlays associated with the acquisition were financed from operating cash 
at december  and  the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired has been included in goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  airflow s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
advance power early in the second quarter of  we acquired privately held advance power ltd  a uk based manufacturer of dc power systems used in communications and internet applications  for million in cash plus expenses 
our cash outlays associated with the acquisition were financed from operating cash 
at december  and  the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired has been included in goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  advance power s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
abl electronics corporation early in the second quarter of  we acquired privately held abl electronics corporation  a north american provider of computer and network cables  switches  and other connectivity products  for million paid in a combination of cash and stock  plus expenses 
our cash outlays associated with the acquisition were financed from operating cash 
at december  and  the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired has been included in goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  abl s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
select assets of arris group inc in the fourth quarter of  we acquired select inventory and related technology associated with outside plant  networking power product lines from arris group inc for million paid in cash 
the product lines were acquired from arris energylinkt family of power supplies  enclosures and equipment for network broadband power  including the tspt total system power line 
the products lines are designed for outdoor use  commonly installed on utility poles or adjacent to fiber nodes  and provide back up power for broadband cable applications 
our cash outlays associated with this purchase were financed from operating cash 
foreign currency activity we invoice our customers in various currencies 
realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are measured based upon the effect of changes in exchange rates on the actual or expected amount of functional currency cash flows 
transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in  and at december   apc s unhedged foreign currency accounts receivable  by currency  were as follows in thousands foreign us currency dollars european euros   japanese yen   swiss francs   british pounds   apc also had non trade receivables denominated in irish pounds of approximately us million  liabilities denominated in various european currencies of approximately us million  and liabilities denominated in japanese yen of approximately us million 
we continually review our foreign exchange exposure and consider various risk management techniques  including the netting of foreign currency receipts and disbursements  rate protection agreements with customers vendors and derivatives arrangements  including foreign exchange contracts 
we presently do not utilize rate protection agreements or derivative arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  also refer to note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  bad debts  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  restructuring reserves and contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in general  revenue is recognized when title has passed at the time of delivery of product for all of our operating segments as stipulated by the delivery terms for the sales transactions 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition  we require persuasive evidence of the arrangement  that the price is fixed or determinable  and that collectibility is reasonably assured 
installation is not applicable for small systems and other segment products based on the nature of the products sold 
generally  revenue associated with large systems sales is also recognized at the time of delivery pursuant to the delivery terms  as we do not perform installation 
delivery terms vary  but often include origin based terms eg  fob shipping point and ex works and destination based terms eg  ddu ddp delivered duty unpaid delivered duty paid 
certain large systems product lines and  at times  one product line included in the small systems segment require electrical hardwire installation or duct installation which is performed by the customer or their contracted licensed contractor electrician 
since we do not perform the installation  revenue recognition at the time of delivery is proper as customer acceptance of the unit is not required 
also  payment by the customer is not contingent upon installation of the product 
we offer additional services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  including on site services  installation consulting services  remote monitoring services  power audit services  and network integration services 
revenue is recognized at the time services are provided or is deferred and recognized over the service period where applicable 
the fair value of these services are based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions and such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through certain customers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes a customer specified acceptance provision  acceptance generally occurs at our factory prior to delivery 
as we introduce new products in  particularly powerstruxure  we anticipate that installation and customer acceptance provisions will become more common  and therefore increasingly significant for determining delivery and performance and consequently our entitlement to recognize revenue 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for sales returns  doubtful accounts  and inventory obsolescence  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation significant management judgments that affect the application of our revenue policy also include estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and channel inventories when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we provide limited rights of return to distributors and retailers for our small systems product lines 
we provide appropriate reserves for returns at the time that related revenue is recognized based on historical patterns of returns and contractual provisions in accordance with the provisions of sfas and sab returns of large systems products generally do not occur 
historically  returns have represented of gross sales and have not differed significantly from prior estimates 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances in view of customer credit worthiness  customer concentrations  historical bad debts  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a majority of international customer balances are covered by receivables insurance 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  our inventory reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
we maintain an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
for pending claims for which there is an estimatable range of loss greater than zero  we record the best estimate of liability within the range 
if no point within the range is considered the best estimate  we record the minimum estimated liability 
because of uncertainties related to the identifiable range of loss on any pending claims  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending claims and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
the litigation process is uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
should our assessment suggest impairment  we would determine recoverability based on an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows resulting from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
expectations about future taxable income incorporate numerous assumptions about actions  elections and strategies to minimize income taxes in future years 
our ability to take such actions  make preferred elections and implement tax planning strategies may be adversely impacted by enacted changes in tax laws and or tax rates  as well as successful challenges by tax authorities resulting from differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
to the extent we believe that recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses generated in for the start up of brazilian operations  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million

we adopted eitf on january  our adoption of eitf will result in a reclassification for the  and consolidated income statements to reduce net sales and also reduce marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the adoption of eitf will have no impact on profit from operations  net income or earnings per share 
factors that may affect future results this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this document 
our annual and quarterly results are likely to be volatile 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the growth rates in the ups industry and related industries  including but not limited to the pc  server  networking  telecommunications and enterprise hardware industries  timing of orders from  and shipments to  customers  timing of new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products  increased competition  our ability to execute our planned job reductions and realize anticipated cost savings  changes in manufacturing costs  changes in the mix of product sales  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component constraints and shortages  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  expansion of manufacturing capacity  factors associated with international operations  acts of terrorism  war and political instability  and volatility in world economic conditions 
we currently compete with several firms providing power protection and related products and services and expect competition to increase in the future  which could affect our revenue and profitability 
we believe that we are one of less than ten global companies providing a full range of ups products and services worldwide 
the ups  power protection and related industries  however  are highly competitive on both a worldwide basis and a regional geographic basis 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual product and application niches 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect our revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in our products include product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  and product design and price 
some of our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
failure to alter our products to meet the demands of technological innovation could seriously harm our business 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products or in responding effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
the timely availability of new products and enhancements  and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
delays in such availability or a lack of market acceptance could have an adverse effect on our business 
defects in our products could seriously harm our business 
our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers 
these defects could result in loss or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  or financial condition 
loss of any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel  many of whom we would have difficulty replacing 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  and management  sales  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
because we depend on foreign operations and revenues  we are exposed to currency fluctuations  import barriers and other risks related to conducting foreign operations 
we manufacture and market our products worldwide through several foreign subsidiaries  distributors  and resellers 
our worldwide operations are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to customer and vendor financial instability  volatility in world economic conditions  the disruption of markets  changes in export or import laws  restrictions on currency exchanges  potentially negative tax consequences  longer payment terms  acts of war  terrorism and political instability  and the modification or introduction or government policies with potentially adverse effects 
international sales  which are both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the united states  accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
we invoice our customers in various currencies 
to date  we do not use any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  we may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
a significant portion of products in our small systems and large systems reportable operating segments are manufactured in foreign locations  particularly developing countries such as brazil  china  india  and the philippines  which subject apc to a number of economic and other risks 
the small systems have particular exposure to the philippines  a country which is experiencing political and financial instability 
disruption of manufacturing efforts in these international facilities could materially adversely impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and potentially result in the loss of business 
because our business relies upon a variety of computer systems to operate effectively  the failure or disruption of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
apc is a highly automated company whose efficient and effective operation relies on a variety of information systems  including e mail  enterprise resource planning  electronic data interchange  customer resource management and e commerce systems 
disruption in the operation of these systems  or difficulties in maintaining or upgrading these systems  could have an adverse effect on our business 
in january  we upgraded our enterprise resource planning system 
difficulties that we have encountered  or may encounter  in connection with our implementation and use of this upgraded enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our order management and fulfillment  financial reporting and supply chain management processes  and any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on sole source suppliers may result in product delays or price increases 
we currently obtain certain components of our products and certain finished products from sole sources 
in the future  our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for components and products in a timely and cost effective manner 
our inability to secure and qualify alternative sources of supply in a timely manner may disrupt our ability to fulfill customer orders 
we generally purchase these sole source components and products using purchase orders and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components and products is dependent in part on our ability to provide the suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements 
however  our operating results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components and products 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and others could infringe on or misappropriate our propriety rights and information 
our success will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets  patents  and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
although we own certain patents  and we have applied  and in the future we may apply  for patents  our intellectual property protection may not be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors which independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we attempt to ensure that our products and processes do not infringe upon third party patents and other proprietary rights  but from time to time third parties have alleged  and in the future may allege  such infringement 
if third parties allege or determine infringement  we may not prevail in such a challenge 
furthermore  if infringement is determined  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to identify and successfully integrate acquisitions  our ability to expand and our financial results could suffer 
we have limited experience in integrating acquired companies or technologies into our operations 
we may from time to time pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets  products or technologies 
we may not be able to integrate successfully products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies into our business or product offerings 
in addition  the integration of acquired companies may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
further  these acquired companies  assets  products or technologies may not contribute significantly to our sales or earnings  and the sales and earnings from acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the integration process or other factors 
if we are not successful in the integration of such acquired businesses  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products developed by us or our competitors  and acts of war  terrorism and political instability and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our tax rate depends on earnings derived from certain foreign manufacturing operations 
our tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that we derive from our ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and our ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of our total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should our ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  our effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for in addition  should our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to our ireland or philippines manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  our overall effective tax rate could increase 
we are  and may become  involved in litigation  which could materially harm our business 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
the litigation process is uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation
