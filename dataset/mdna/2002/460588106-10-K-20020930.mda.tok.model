to accommodate our financial needs for inventory financing  we have arranged a line of credit with one financial institution in the aggregate amount of  at june   our indebtedness was  or a decrease of  compared to june  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to this consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  and goodwill impairments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we will perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  the company must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to the company s results of operations 
issues and uncertainties the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the companys financial outlook 
the computer industry is characterized by a number of potentially adverse business conditions  including pricing pressures  evolving distribution channels  market consolidation and a decline in the rate of growth in sales of personal computers 
heightened price competition among various hardware manufacturers may result in reduced per unit revenue and declining gross profit margins 
as a result of the intense price competition within our industry  we have experienced increasing pressure on our gross profit and operating margins with respect to our sale of products 
our inability to compete successfully on the pricing of products sold  or a continuing decline in gross margins on products sold due to adverse industry conditions or competition  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an integral part of our strategy is to increase our value added services revenue 
these services generally provide higher operating margins than those associated with the sale of products 
this strategy requires us  among other things  to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees in a competitive labor market  provide additional training to our sales representatives and enhance our existing service management system 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in increasing our focus on providing value added services  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  our revenues have been based primarily upon sales in the new york metropolitan area and albany  new york 
our strategy  encompassing the expansion of service offerings and the expansion of existing offices  has challenged and will continue to challenge our senior management and infrastructure 
we cannot predict our ability to respond to these challenges 
if we fail to effectively manage our planned growth  there may be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the success of our strategy depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel and sales representatives  including independent sales representatives  in a very competitive labor market 
our ability to grow our service offerings has been somewhat limited by a shortage of qualified personnel  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such skilled personnel and representatives 
the loss of a significant number of our existing technical personnel or sales representatives  difficulty in hiring or retaining additional technical personnel or sales representatives  or reclassification of our sales representatives as employees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the computer industry is characterized by intense competition 
we directly compete with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors as well as with certain computer manufacturers that market through direct sales forces and or the internet 
the computer industry has recently experienced a significant amount of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions  and manufacturers of personal computers may increase competition by offering a range of services in addition to their current product and service offerings 
in the future  we may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
moreover  additional suppliers and manufacturers may choose to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force and or the internet rather than or in addition to channel distribution  and may also choose to market services  such as repair and configuration services  directly to end users 
some of our competitors have or may have  greater financial  marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than us 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential competitors 
our business is dependent upon our relationships with major manufacturers and distributors in the computer industry 
many aspects of our business are affected by our relationships with major manufacturers  including product availability  pricing and related terms  and reseller authorizations 
the increasing demand for personal computers and ancillary equipment has resulted in significant product shortages from time to time  because manufacturers have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of certain products to meet demand 
in addition  many manufacturers have adopted just in time manufacturing principles that can reduce the immediate availability of a wide range of products at any one time 
we cannot predict that manufacturers will maintain an adequate supply of these products to satisfy all the orders of our customers or that  during periods of increased demand  manufacturers will provide products to us  even if available  or at discounts previously offered to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers will not adversely change in the future 
our failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer  the deterioration of our relationship with a major manufacturer or our inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on may   the hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation merged 
atec sells the products of both companies and we believe that we have strong relationships with both companies 
while we do not believe that there will be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as a result of this merger  there can be no assurance that such a material adverse effect will not occur 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introduction of new hardware and software products and services 
this may render many existing products and services noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
our continued success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the technological developments of new products and services and to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
our success will also depend upon our abilities to address the technical requirements of our customers arising from new generations of computer technologies  to obtain these new products from present or future suppliers and vendors at reasonable costs  to educate and train our employees as well as our customers with respect to these new products or services and to integrate effectively and efficiently these new products into both our internal systems and systems developed for our customers 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing product and service developments or enhancements in response to these technological changes 
our failure to respond effectively to these technological changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid product improvement and technological change characterize the computer industry 
this results in relatively short product life cycles and rapid product obsolescence  which can place inventory at considerable valuation risk 
certain of our suppliers provide price protection to us  which is intended to reduce the risk of inventory devaluation due to price reductions on current products 
certain of our suppliers also provide stock balancing to us pursuant to which we are able to return unsold inventory to a supplier as a partial credit against payment for new products 
there are often restrictions on the dollar amount of inventory that we can return at any one time 
price protection and stock balancing may not be available to us in the future  and  even if available  these measures may not provide complete protection against the risk of excess or obsolete inventories 
certain manufacturers have reduced the period for which they provide price protection and stock balancing rights 
although we maintain a sophisticated proprietary inventory management system  we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully manage our existing and future inventory 
our failure to successfully manage our current or future inventory may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
as a result of the rapid changes that are taking place in computer and networking technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  our product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change  with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
the computer industry has experienced rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers 
in some instances  we have been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not continue to decline or that we will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
most of the personal computers we sell utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought a successful antitrust action against microsoft  which could delay the introduction and distribution of microsoft products 
the potential unavailability of microsoft products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risks we presently do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in commodity prices or other market risks  nor do we invest in speculative financial instruments 
borrowings under our line of credit are at prime plus a quarter percent  which is adjusted monthly 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of atec s borrowings and short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material risk exposure and  therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
