item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion of the financial results  liquidity  and other key items related to the company s performance 
this section should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in the financial statements section of this report 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
all references to    and refer to fiscal year periods ended september     and  respectively 
introduction rayovac corporation is one of the oldest battery companies in the united states  founded in as the french battery company 
rayovac s product portfolio includes alkaline  rechargeable  and heavy duty batteries  hearing aid batteries  lighting products  and other specialty batteries 
our financial performance is influenced by a number of factors including general economic conditions and trends in consumer markets  our overall product line mix  including sales prices and gross margins which vary by product line  and our general competitive position  especially as impacted by our competitors promotional activities and pricing strategies 
these influencing factors played significant roles in our financial results during  and we manage our business based upon three geographic regions 
the regions are as follows north america  which includes the united states and canada  latin america  which includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean  and europe rest of world europe row  which includes the united kingdom  continental europe and all other countries in which we do business 
set forth below are other significant developments that have impacted our results and may continue to affect our performance 
continued manufacturing cost reduction initiatives we continually assess our worldwide manufacturing capacity and product costs in light of existing and forecasted market demand 
with our continued focus on cost reduction and rationalization  we believe we can continue to drive down our cost of goods manufactured with continued focus on cost reduction initiatives 
in furtherance of this goal  we closed our wonewoc  wisconsin plant during and now source lighting products previously made at this plant from third party suppliers 
with this closure  we now outsource all of our lighting products 
similarly  we closed our zinc carbon battery plants in tegucigalpa  honduras  and santo domingo  dominican republic in and  respectively 
we closed the mexico city  mexico plant in october with the closure of the mexico city  mexico plant  and prior to the acquisition discussed below  the guatemala city  guatemala plant is our only remaining zinc carbon manufacturing plant 
the consolidation of our zinc carbon capacity within latin america is consistent with the global market trend away from zinc carbon toward alkaline batteries 
in october  we announced the closure of operations at our madison  wisconsin packaging center and middleton  wisconsin distribution center and combination of the two operations into a new leased complex being built in dixon  illinois 
transition to the new facililty is expected by june meeting consumer needs through technology and development we continue to focus our efforts on meeting consumer needs for portable power and lighting products through new product development and technology innovations 
we have announced improvements and new developments in our rechargeable  alkaline  hearing aid  and lighting products product lines 
during  we introduced a one hour charger for nickel metal hydride nimh batteries  and began selling higher performing nimh batteries 
in  we announced the development of a revolutionary rechargeable nimh battery system capable of recharging batteries in as little as minutes and which we anticipate will be available in the retail market during these technological advancements are expected to provide consumers with portable  rechargeable power as the use of digital cameras and other high drain devices continues to grow 
in  we launched our new  more powerful maximum plus alkaline batteries  with bold new graphics 
also during and  we increased the performance of our hearing aid batteries  and launched innovative packaging allowing consumers to more easily dispense the hearing aid batteries 
finally  we rejuvenated our lighting products product line through a series of new product launches designed to reach unique markets within the mass and retail channels 
we believe that our products are well poised to meet the portable power and lighting needs for consumers 
we will continue to focus on identifying new technologies necessary to meet consumer and retailer needs within the marketplace 
competitive landscape the alkaline battery business is highly competitive on a global scale 
within north america  there are three primary branded providers of alkaline batteries 
the alkaline marketplace has seen changes in recent years related to product line segmentation  with attempts to segment the category into high performance  regular and value positions  combined with the introduction of private label batteries at certain retailers 
in addition  market participants continue to engage in high levels of promotional activities to gain market share 
within latin america  poor economic conditions have dramatically impacted battery sales especially within the heavy duty product line 
heavy duty batteries continue to be the largest share of the battery market in latin america 
in north america the majority of consumers purchase alkaline batteries 
the rechargeable business has experienced dramatic changes over the past three years 
primary rechargeable alkaline sales have declined over this period with a shift towards rechargeable batteries  such as nimh  which are higher performing in high drain devices 
our development of a one hour charger and an innovative minute rechargeable battery technology help us maintain the number one market position within the rechargeable category in the united states with approximately market share  as estimated by management 
within the hearing aid battery category  we continue to hold the number one global market position based on management estimates 
we believe that our close relationship with hearing aid manufacturers and other customers  as well as our product performance improvements and packaging innovations position us for continued success in this category 
recent developments on october   we acquired the consumer battery business of varta ag varta 
the combination of the rayovac and varta brands makes us a much stronger global competitor selling in more than countries worldwide 
we believe that the combination of these two businesses provides us with a strong platform for market growth  improved customer service  and technology advancements for consumers 
we are now one of the largest consumer battery companies in the world with the number one market position in germany  the largest european battery market  number two overall market position in europe  a stronger number one position in latin america  excluding brazil  as well as the leading value brand in north america all market shares based on management estimates on a unit basis 
on october   we announced a series of initiatives to position the combined company for future growth opportunities and to optimize the global resources of the combined varta and rayovac organizations 
these initiatives include the elimination of duplicate costs in the varta and rayovac organizations and are expected to provide significant benefit to the combined organization 
we expect that all geographies will benefit from these initiatives 
seasonal product sales rayovac s quarterly results are impacted by our seasonal sales 
sales during the first and fourth fiscal quarters of the year are generally higher than other quarters due to the impact of the december holiday season 
the seasonality of our sales during the last three fiscal years is as follows percent of annual sales fiscal quarter ended december march june september fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  highlights of consolidated operating results net sales 
our net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
increases in hearing aid battery and lighting product sales were unable to offset declines in heavy duty and alkaline sales 
net income 
our net income for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million the previous year 
the increase reflects a reduction in interest expense attributable to the retirement of million in senior subordinated notes following the june stock offering  plus a million reduction in debt during fiscal due to strong cash flow from operations 
in addition  fiscal results reflect a million pretax restructuring charge  and a million extraordinary loss  net of tax 
these improvements were partially offset by a bad debt reserve of million  net of tax  recognized in fiscal related to the bankruptcy filing of a key customer 
segment results 
we evaluate segment profitability based on income from operations before special charges and corporate expenses  which includes corporate purchasing expense  general and administrative expense and research and development expense 
all depreciation and amortization included in income from operations is related to a segment

this was partially offset by a million bad debt reserve  net of recoveries  resulting from the bankruptcy filing of a key customer 
latin america revenue from external customers segment profit segment profit as a of net sales our revenue from external customers decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year due primarily to decreased sales of zinc carbon batteries 
net sales were impacted by unfavorable economic conditions  curtailment of shipments to certain distributors and wholesalers who were delinquent on payments  political uncertainties in argentina and venezuela  and the unfavorable impacts of currency devaluation which contributed approximately million of the sales decline versus fiscal in spite of the sales decline  the segment remained profitable  with profit of million in fiscal however  this was a decrease of million  or  from the previous year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the sales decline  partially offset by lower advertising expenses and a reduction in other operating expenses in the region

hearing aid battery sales increases of million  or  were driven by strength in the professional channel and expanded retail distribution in fiscal lighting product sales decreases of million  or  were driven by weakness in the lights and lantern battery category reflecting the lingering impact of the yk phenomenon and our inability to anniversary a strong hurricane season in the previous year 
specialty battery sales decreases versus last year primarily reflect softness in camcorder and lithium battery sales reflecting general softness in lithium battery demand from oem customers in the pc  telecommunications  and electronics industries and the transition to a camcorder battery licensing agreement 
our profitability decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million the previous year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to sales volume decreases and operating expense increases partially offset by improved gross profit margins 
the operating expense increases were primarily driven by increased distribution costs reflecting fuel surcharges  higher shipping and handling costs and bad debt write offs due to customer bankruptcies 
the improvement in gross profit margins was primarily the result of previously announced cost rationalization initiatives and a favorable shift in product mix away from lower margin lithium  camcorder  and lighting products to more profitable alkaline and hearing aid batteries

capital expenditures for fiscal were million  a decrease of million from fiscal capital expenditures in were funded by cash flow from operations 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million which will include spending for leasehold improvements on our new north american packaging and distribution center  spending required by newly acquired varta entities  and continued technology investments as well as continued investment in our manufacturing operations 
as of september   our current credit facilities include a revolving credit facility of million and a million five year amortizing term loan 
as of september   million and million  respectively  of the revolver and the term loan were outstanding 
in addition  approximately million of the remaining availability under the revolver was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
the term facility also provides for annual prepayments  over and above the normal amortization 
such payments would be a portion of excess cash flow ebitda  as defined  less certain operating expenditures including scheduled principal payments of long term debt

impact of recently issued accounting standards see discussion in note w to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management judgment and estimates in areas that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of assets and asset impairment we evaluate certain long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and certain intangibles for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
we adopted financial accounting standards statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  statement no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  and that impairment of such assets be evaluated as discussed above at least annually 
we evaluate deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and other assumptions  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease future earnings projections and could  therefore  change the determination of whether the asset is realizable 
see notes c  h  i  v    and to the consolidated financial statements for more information about these assets 
revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk we recognize revenue from product sales at the point at which all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
the company is not obligated to allow for product returns 
the company enters into various promotional arrangements  primarily with retail customers  which require the company to estimate total purchases from the company 
in addition  the company enters into promotional programs  primarily with retail customers  which require the company to estimate and accrue the estimated costs of the promotional program 
the company monitors its commitments for promotional arrangements and programs  and uses statistical measures and past experience to record a liability for the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs and could  therefore  change the liability recorded 
the company s trade receivables subject the company to credit risk which is evaluated based on changing economic  political  and specific customer conditions 
the company assesses these risks and makes provisions for collectibility based on our best estimate of the risks present and information available at the date of the financial statements 
the use of different assumptions may change the estimate of collectibility 
see notes b  c  and e to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our revenue recognition and credit policies 
pensions our accounting for pension benefits is primarily based on discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets  and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the markets and or interest rate declines  as was experienced in fiscal  our pension liability increases  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our employee benefit plans 
restructuring restructuring liabilities are recorded for estimated cost of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments  and measures undertaken by management to exit certain activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by management after evaluating detailed analyses of the costs incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets  lease termination payments  plus any other items directly related to the exit costs 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  changes in estimates  resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability  may be required as management executes the restructuring plan 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of recent restructuring initiatives and related costs 
loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the outcome of existing litigation and the impact of environmental matters are examples of situations evaluated as loss contingencies 
estimating the probability and magnitude of losses is often dependent upon management judgments of potential actions by third parties and regulators 
it is possible that changes in estimates or an increased probability of an unfavorable outcome could materially affect future results of operations 
see further discussion in item legal proceedings  and notes c  t  and to the consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above  are also critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
our notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note in the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
the general level of us interest rates  libor  ibor  and to a lesser extent european base rates  primarily affects interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements  as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales are made primarily in pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros  mexican pesos  dominican pesos  guatemalan quetzals  venezuelan bolivars  argentine pesos  chilean pesos and honduran lempira 
foreign currency purchases are made primarily in pounds sterling  euros  mexican pesos and guatemalan quetzals 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  intercompany loans  firm purchase commitments and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts  foreign exchange rate swaps and foreign exchange options 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for purchases of zinc used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks 
earnings projections are before tax 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding interest rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable shift in the underlying interest rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in one year s interest expense on the related debt due to the same shift in interest rates  would be a net loss of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding foreign exchange rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying foreign exchange rates would be immaterial 
the net impact on future cash flows  after also including the gain in value on the related accounts receivable and contractual payment obligations outstanding at september  due to the same change in exchange rates  would be a net gain of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding commodity price derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying commodity prices would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in cost of one year s purchases of the related commodities due to the same change in commodity prices  would be a net gain of million
