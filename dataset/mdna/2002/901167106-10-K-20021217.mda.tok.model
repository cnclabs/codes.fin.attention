loss on investment 
loss on investment was due to the write down of the investment in cyberian outpost  which was sold to fcop acquisition  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of fry s electronics  a private company  on november  for 
per share 
net interest income expense 
net interest income decreased to  for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was due primarily to the borrowings on our revolving credit agreement made in the last fiscal quarter of income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate for the years ended september  and was 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
additionally  capital needs are created as acquisition opportunities are pursued 
our primary sources of financing have been net cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the sale of equity or subordinated notes 
at september  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september  this was a result of million in income before the non cash impairment charge  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease of million in accounts receivable and a tax benefit of options exercised of million 
this was offset by an increase in inventory of million  a deferred income tax benefit of million  an increase of million in prepaid and other current assets and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as minor changes in other operating accounts 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was approximately million 
purchase of property and equipment of million was the primary use of cash in investing activities 
approximately million was used to open twenty two new stores and relocate remodel eight stores and the balance of million was used for other miscellaneous capital expenditures for equipment  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
in addition  million was used for new stores to be opened or relocated after fiscal cash paid for acquisitions and related expenses were million 
in fiscal  net proceeds of million were received from the sale of five of the company s owned properties which the company leases from the buyer 
the termination of the joint venture investment with cyberian outpost 
com provided million in cash  which represented our share of the distribution upon the cessation of the joint venture 
during fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and was used to fund acquisitions  
table of contents open new stores  relocate remodel stores and other capital expenditures for equipment  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures other than new store openings and remodeling or relocating existing stores  which is estimated to be million in the next months 
on june   the company signed a three year senior credit facility which provided the company the ability to borrow up to million 
on may  the credit facility was amended to increase the availability to million 
the credit facility was amended on september  to allow the restrictive covenants to be calculated without the impact of an impairment charge to intangible assets 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by the company s inventory and certain other assets and bear interest at the lender s base rate at september   or eurodollar pricing plus if the company commits to borrow amounts for a period of at least days 
the company s weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings during was approximately 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants and conditions  including requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and a designated net worth level as well as limits on capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants at september  the credit facility also restricts the company from paying cash dividends 
there was  outstanding under the credit facility as of september  the credit facility has a maturity date of july  we believe that cash expected to be generated from operations  and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of acquisitions  for the next months 
we may need to seek additional debt and or equity financing in order to fund any future acquisitions 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our total revenue and net income for the year during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  with a majority of net income for such quarters realized in the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending 
critical accounting policies presented below is a discussion about our application of critical accounting policies that require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and where different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical for the company  and will discuss them separately below allowance for bad and doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence provision  income tax accruals  self insurance reserves  goodwill and other intangible assets valuation and deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this md a 

table of contents allowance for bad and doubtful accounts most of our accounts receivable are due from our vendors and less than are due from customers 
our net accounts receivable balance at september  of  constitutes of our total assets  and the reserve of  is of gross accounts receivable 
we categorize our accounts receivable by business type and estimate our bad debt reserve using four aging classifications current  to days  to days and over days 
for each business type  based on the amounts in each aging category  we apply a percentage to determine the amount of the reserve to be applied to each category 
if a further review of a business type shows that this methodology needs to be adjusted  the percentage of reserve is adjusted accordingly 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have increased our bad debt reserve to reflect our estimated valuation of gross receivables 
it is also possible that bad debt write off could increase significantly in the future 
we have historically estimated our bad and doubtful debt allowance as a percentage of the aging categories  which could differ materially if the historical trend changed 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported accounts receivable balance and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of the results of operations 
for those reasons  and in view of the fact that our accounts receivable balance is of our total assets at september   we believe that the accounting estimate related to bad and doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to assume that our estimate of bad debts was changed to the lower end or upper end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  the estimate for bad debt as of september  would range from  to  accordingly  the amounts we would record for net receivables would range from  to  as compared to the recorded amount of  inventory obsolescence inventory represents a significant portion of our assets 
our profitability and viability is highly dependent on the demand for our products 
an imbalance between purchasing levels and sales could cause rapid and material obsolescence  and loss of competitive price advantage and market share 
we believe that our product mix has provided sufficient diversification to mitigate this risk 
at the end of each reporting period  we reduce the value by our estimate of what we believe to be obsolete  and we recognize an expense of the same amount  which is included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income 
in our industry merchandise models change periodically 
when they do  we reclassify the old model into a discontinued category 
we also reclassify merchandise into the discontinued category when we decide we no longer want to sell the item 
generally  we will sell these discontinued models for normal retail 
in estimating our reserve  we analyze the sales of discontinued merchandise by department and determine what profit or loss was made in the quarter 
if product of the discontinued department sold for below cost during the quarter  then we apply that negative percentage to the value of the inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
in addition to this reserve we also identify the selling costs to be incurred in the sale of such discontinued inventory and add that to this obsolescence reserve 
we also evaluate the obsolescence of our service parts inventory based on the aging of this inventory 
we apply a percentage to each aging category in order to determine the reserve amount 
as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have reduced our net inventory value to reflect our estimated amount of inventory obsolescence 
it is also possible that obsolescence could rapidly become a significant issue in the future 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to assume that our estimate of future inventory obsolescence for all of our merchandise and parts was changed to the lower end or upper end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  the estimate as of september  would range from  to  as compared to 
table of contents the actual recorded amount of  accordingly  the amounts by which we would record net inventory would range from  to  as compared to the actual recorded amount of  income taxes our estimate of the expense or benefit and the sufficiency of the income tax accrual is somewhat dependent on our assessment of certain tax filing exposures 
we provide for potential tax exposures arising from routine audits by taxing agencies 
it is reasonably possible to assume that actual amounts payable as a result of such audits could be materially different from amounts accrued in the consolidated balance sheet 
our estimate of deferred tax assets is impacted by our assessment of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to be able to realize the deferred tax asset 
based on management s assessment of our historical performance and the current economic conditions  we have determined that no valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is required as of september  as we believe that we will be sufficiently profitable as to realize all recognized deferred tax assets 
should we not generate the expected levels of taxable income  a valuation allowance could be required 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for workers compensation  general liability insurance and medical dental benefits and evaluate our liability estimate on a quarterly basis based on actuarial information and past experience 
historical claims are reviewed as to when they are incurred versus when they are actually paid and an average claims lag is determined 
once the average historical lag is determined  it is applied to the current level of claims being processed 
management believes  and past experience has confirmed  the underwriting cost reductions outweigh the financial risk incurred by self insurance of workers compensation  general liability and medical dental benefits 
accounting standards require that a related loss contingency be recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
we determined that the total future liability related to claims that have already incurred but not billed is  we believe that the accounting estimate related to assessment of future liability for current insurance claims is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement that our management make assumptions about future costs of claims based on historical costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets valuation we amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives on a straight line basis over the period of their useful lives 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we performed our annual test for impairment in september we performed a valuation analysis of the company with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
as a result of this review  it was determined that of our goodwill  and a portion of our intangibles  were impaired 
as of september   no goodwill balance remains on the consolidated balance sheet and the net book value of other intangible assets is  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement that several assumptions are inherent within the discounted cash flow analysis  such as anticipated revenue and expense growth rates discount rates  among others 
deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising we receive cash discounts for timely payment of merchandise invoices and recognize these amounts based on the sale of the inventory 
the amount of the deferral for discounts received but not yet recognized is  as of september  and is classified as a reduction in gross inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also receive substantial funds from our vendors for volume rebates and coop advertising 
these funds can be earned in two ways  the first is based on levels of inventory purchases and the second is based on 
table of contents performance of specific advertising activities 
amounts earned based on levels of inventory purchases are recognized in the income statement based on when the inventory from each vendor is sold 
amounts earned based on performance of specific advertising activities are recognized in the income statement as these activities are performed 
the amount of the deferral for amounts received related to levels of inventory purchases is  as of september  no amounts were deferred as of september  for specific advertising activities as we did not have any unfulfilled obligations in relation to cash received prior to the year end 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in inventory levels  the vendor mix of the inventory on hand  and the timing of performance of specific advertising activities in relation to when the cash for these activities is received

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
at september   we had  of variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility which approximates fair value 
a adverse change in interest rates for this variable rate debt would have an approximate  annual impact on our earnings and cash flows
