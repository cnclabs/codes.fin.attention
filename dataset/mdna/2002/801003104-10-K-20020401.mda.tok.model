sangstat is a global biotechnology company expanding on its transplantation foundation to discover  develop and market high value therapeutic products in immunology  hematology oncology and auto immune disease 
since  we have been dedicated to improving the outcome of organ and bone marrow transplantation through the development and marketing of products to address all phases of transplantation in the worldwide market 
we are headquartered in fremont  california 
we maintain a strong european and uspresence  including direct sales and marketing forces in all major european markets and the us and distributors throughout the rest of the world 
historically  our business was comprised of two segments pharmaceutical products and transplantation services 
in october  we implemented a new strategy focused on growing a core business in high value therapeutics that builds on our expertise in transplantation but extends into new therapeutic areas 
as a result of this new strategy  we decided to dedicate significant resources to our pharmaceutical products segment  which consists of four marketed products and three principal product candidates 
on april   we sold our transplantation services segment  the transplant pharmacy  to chronimed  for cash proceeds of million 
consequently  the historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been restated for all periods presented to account for the transplantation services segment business as a discontinued operation 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations and excludes our discontinued operation 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for consideration net of underwriting discounts of  we anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering will be used for repayment of existing indebtedness to abbott laboratories and general corporate purposes  including in licensing and partnering opportunities 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  is recognized upon receipt by the customer  when a purchase order has been received  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  including contract pricing agreements  promotions  other volume based incentives and estimated future returns  in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return  and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on historical rates 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties that are recorded in the same period as the related revenue 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates for these revenue adjustments  it is possible that actual amounts realized could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could affect our operating results 
revenue from collaborative agreements is recognized in accordance with the related contract terms 
upfront or milestone payments received under such agreements are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the life of the agreement where significant obligations for future services or the company s participation exist or as milestones are met and no significant obligation for future services exists 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we classify inventory not expected to be utilized within the next twelve months as long term assets 
we evaluate our inventory levels based on our estimates of marketing approval and forecasts of future sales  among other things 
if these estimates or forecasts change at some time in the future we may be required to record additional charges for the write down of excess or obsolete inventories 
at december  we classified approximately million of bulk cyclosporine raw materials inventory  net of reserves  as other long term assets 
foreign currency gains and losses many of our foreign sales are invoiced in local currencies  creating receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro and the japanese yen but also in the uk pound 
the risk due to foreign currency fluctuations associated with these receivables is partially reduced by local payables denominated in the same currencies  and presently we do not consider it necessary to hedge these exposures 
however  we may revise our hedging policy from time to time as our foreign operations change 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included on other income expense net in our statement of operations and were not significant for any period presented 
income taxes sangstat has operations in several countries other than the united states  including france where we manufacture thymoglobulin 
this product is then sold to other sangstat entities in other countries  including the united states 
we believe that we record these sales at an appropriate transfer price  however it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge these transfer prices and assess additional taxes on prior period transactions 
any such assessment could require us to record an additional tax provision in our statement of operations 
we have substantial deferred tax assets that relate to prior period losses  primarily in the united states 
we evaluate these deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction by estimating the likelihood of the company generating future profits to realize these assets 
in most cases  we have assumed that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets and have created valuation reserves to reduce the net asset values to zero 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  we may be able to reverse the valuation allowances in future periods should the company generate taxable income 
at december   we had approximately million of valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over total revenues of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased sales of gengraf and thymoglobulin in the us  which accounted for  and  of the increase  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales of other products 
it should be noted that net product sales in fiscal included a full year of sales of gengraf  which was launched in the us in may  compared with only eight months of sales in fiscal on june  we  in discussions with the fda that began on june   concluded that a recall of sangcya oral solution from the us market would be required 
following further discussions with the fda as to the type of recall and mechanism for conducting it  we announced this decision on july  as a result  net sales for the year ended december  were reduced by  for returns of sangcya oral solution from customers following the product recall 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over total revenues of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to sales of gengraf  which was launched in the us in may  and increased sales of thymoglobulin in the us  which accounted for  and  of the increase  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales outside the us 
in particular  sales in europe for the year ended december  were adversely affected by weakening currencies 
had average exchange rates remained the same as in fiscal  total revenues in fiscal would have been higher by approximately  included in total revenues was revenue from collaborative agreements of  in  an increase of  or over revenue from collaborative agreements of  in revenue from such agreements in fiscal represented an increase of  or over revenue of  for the year ended december  in  and  we recognized revenue of   and  from milestone payments from abbott laboratories under the co promotion agreement for cyclosporine 
the unamortized portion of these milestone payments is shown as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the co promotion agreement 
we also recognized revenue from milestone payments of  in from amgen under the collaborative distribution agreement for our cyclosporine products in certain territories outside the us 
cost of sales 
cost of sales were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over cost of sales of  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales for the year ended december  was due to the overall increase in sales and the higher cost of gengraf compared to our other products 
cost of sales of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or over cost of sales of  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to the establishment of inventory reserves resulting from the us recall of sangcya oral solution 
these product recall charges  which totaled  included a percent reserve for all sangcya oral solution and cyclotech finished goods and components  as well as a partial reserve against our bulk cyclosporine inventories that we do not expect to use prior to lot expiration 
the remainder of the increase in cost of sales for the year ended december  was due to the overall increase in sales and the higher cost of gengraf compared to our other products 
research and development 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or over research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease in spending on research and development mainly relates to payments to abgenix for a license fee payment and sangstat s negotiated share of prior development costs incurred by abgenix for abx cbl totaling  which did not recur in  and a decrease in spending on sangcya oral solution and related products 
this decrease in spending was partially offset by an increase in spending on rdp and the ongoing development of abx cbl for the year ended december  research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or over research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in spending on research and development for the year ended december  mainly relates to charges for a license fee and reimbursement of development costs for abx cbl totaling  clinical trials to pursue label expansion of thymoglobulin and continued pre clinical work on rdp the expenses for the year ended december  also included  to cover the cost of terminating sangcya oral solution clinical trials following the previously discussed product recall 
while we allocate scientists and track resources when required pursuant to the terms of a partnering or similar arrangement  members of our research team typically work on a number of products concurrently  and our equipment and intellectual property resources often are deployed over a range of products with a view to maximizing the benefit of our investment 
accordingly  the company has not and does not intend to separately track the costs for each of its research projects so as to enable accurate disclosure of the actual costs incurred to date on a product by product basis 
for the year ended december   however  we estimate that the majority of our research and development expense was associated with our three leading product candidates  rdp  abx cbl and cyclosporine capsules 
the balance of our expense was associated primarily with ongoing development of our marketed products  primarily clinical trials for thymoglobulin  and early stage product candidates 
we have completed phase i clinical trials for rdp and subsequently started a phase iia trial in october we currently expect to announce results of this trial in the second half of we are also conducting a phase ii iii study for abx cbl  which we expect to complete by the end of we are conducting bioequivalence and stability studies for a cyclosporine capsule 
if the results from these studies are favorable  we expect to file for marketing approval for this product in a major european country  which we currently estimate will occur in late we also have under way two clinical trials involving thymoglobulin 
one trial compares thymoglobulin with simulect 
the study was closed early in march  with a total enrollment of participants out of a planned  after an interim analysis revealed significantly fewer acute rejections of implanted kidneys in patients treated with thymoglobulin versus simulect 
the second trial investigates the use of thymoglobulin in myelodysplastic syndrome  we aim to complete enrollment of patients into this study by the end of the primary end point is days after enrollment 
of course our timeline is an estimate that is subject to change from time to time 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our proposed drugs  we are unable to further specify with meaningful certainty the estimated completion date or estimated cost of completion of our proposed products  or whether any of our products will eventually be successfully developed 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties surrounding the development and cost of these products and effectively precluding such disclosure  see risk factors if we do not develop and market new products  our business will be harmed 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or over selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses for the year ended december  reflects the results of sangstat s cost control efforts through the continuation of its cost containment program  including a reduction in launch and marketing expenses for gengraf  a reduction in sangstat s share of phase iv gengraf study expenses  and a reduction in legal expenses associated with the novartis lawsuits 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to expenses of  associated with the launch of gengraf 
expenses for the year ended december  also included  to cover the cost of managing the product recall of sangcya oral solution and terminating ongoing marketing programs 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by an overall reduction in spending resulting from the cost containment measures announced in october amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense for the imtix acquisition related intangible assets was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization expense in includes the write off of  representing the net book value of the intangible asset related to distribution rights for multitest and celiptium  two minor products formerly sold in europe 
sales of these two products were discontinued in the fourth quarter of interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for both fiscal and  the change in interest income versus the prior year primarily reflected the change in the average cash balances available for investment 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in fiscal over reflected the effects of the finova loan termination agreement 
we recorded a full year of interest expense in fiscal on the notes payable to aventis  abbott laboratories and the convertible note and eight months expense on the finova note payable compared to twelve months for aventis  six months for abbott and ten months for the convertible debt in fiscal other income expense net 
other income expense net for the year ended december  was an expense of  compared to income of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase in other expense in fiscal was due primarily to the expenses of  related to a breach of contract suit in europe including  in interest and other charges that was assessed by the appeals court in lyon  france on march   partially offset by an  reimbursement claim we received from a supplier 
in fiscal and  income was provided primarily by gains on the sale of equity securities of  and  respectively 
income taxes 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and a provision of  and  respectively  for european income taxes based upon the financial results of our european affiliates 
net loss from continuing operations 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss for the year ended december  was primarily due to higher product sales and lower selling  general and administration and research and development expenses  partially offset by higher cost of sales and manufacturing expenses  resulting primarily from the higher product sales 
in addition  the fiscal year ended december  included product recall returns and charges totaling  that did not recur in net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net loss for fiscal was due primarily to the product recall returns and charges totaling  and increases in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by the increase in net sales net of related cost of sales 
net loss from operations of discontinued operation 
net sales of transplantation services for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or from sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales reflects the sale of our transplantation services business  the transplant pharmacy  that closed on april  net sales of transplantation services in fiscal represented an increase of  or over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase in net sales in fiscal was due primarily to an increase in the number of patients serviced by the transplant pharmacy 
net sales for all periods consisted entirely of drug sales to transplant patients 
net loss for transplantation services for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss reflects the sale of our transplantation services business  the transplant pharmacy  that closed on april  net loss for transplantation services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net loss for was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses  partially offset by an increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy 
net loss from disposal of discontinued operation 
net loss on disposal of discontinued operation of  represents sale proceeds of  less estimated expenses of  incurred for the discontinued operation 
these expenses primarily related to the costs associated with the closure of the transplant pharmacy operation including employee severance and the estimated future lease obligations for the facilities supporting the transplant pharmacy 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we financed our operations substantially from proceeds of approximately  from public offerings of our common stock   from private placements of equity securities and  from the convertible note and the note payable to abbott laboratories 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and total assets of  during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of  and  respectively for the years ended december  and the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was due substantially to a significant reduction in net loss and a reduction in other current assets due to the reclassification of  to cash and cash equivalents 
this cash had previously been treated as restricted since it served as collateral for the loan with finova 
however  the loan was repaid in june and therefore the cash is no longer restricted 
other factors contributing to the net cash provided by operating activities included an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in other receivables 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was substantially due to a reduction in net inventories and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net loss 
the reduction in inventories is primarily due to provisions of  relating to the sangcya oral solution product recall  which resulted in a corresponding increase in net loss for fiscal net cash used in also included an increase in other current assets reflecting  cash used as collateral for the note payable to finova 
in fiscal year  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the amount of net loss incurred  as well as an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable over the prior year partially offset by deferred revenue of  representing milestone payments from abbott laboratories in connection with our co promotion agreement with abbott 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled   and  during the years ended december   and respectively 
the amount for fiscal is primarily the result of a decrease in other assets  proceeds from the sale of the transplant pharmacy and maturities of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
in fiscal years and  cash was provided by maturities of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and purchases of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  during the years ended december   and respectively 
in fiscal year  net cash was provided primarily by the sale of common stock  partially offset by repayments of notes and capital lease obligations 
in both fiscal years and  cash was provided by the issuance of notes payable and the sale of common stock which are described in more detail in the following paragraphs 
on april  we signed an agreement with finova to provide a line of credit of up to million the loan agreement 
at december  we had drawn down million under the line of credit and had set aside a corresponding compensating balance  which was included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
subsequently  we repaid the loan balance of  on june   and terminated the loan agreement 
since the loan has been repaid  the  compensating cash balance previously classified as other current assets has now been classified as cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with this financing  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
this warrant was valued using the black scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected life  five years  stock volatility   risk free interest rate   and no dividend payments during the expected term 
the calculated value of the warrant of  and the additional financing fees of  were reflected as additional interest expense over the life of the loan 
in august  we entered into a global co development  supply and license agreement with abgenix  inc for abx cbl  an antibody developed by abgenix 
the agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide license for the marketing and sale of abx cbl  an anti cd monoclonal antibody for the treatment of steroid resistant graft versus host disease gvhd 
abx cbl is currently in a multicenter  randomized  and controlled phase ii iii study 
we made an initial license fee payment of  and an additional payment to abgenix of  as partial reimbursement of one half of the development costs incurred by abgenix between january  and august  the agreement requires us to pay a further  as reimbursement of these development costs in two equal installments at the end of june and  the first of which has been paid 
development costs incurred after august  are being shared equally  as would any potential profits from future sales of collaboration products 
we share responsibility for product development  including the ongoing clinical trial 
abgenix will be responsible for manufacturing abx cbl 
we also have the right  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  to commercialize other anti cd antibodies developed by abgenix 
if abx cbl receives regulatory approval and is launched  we will be required to pay abgenix for our share of development expenses incurred prior to january  the amount has not been determined  but the agreement limits our obligation to  we do not have any obligation to reimburse abgenix until the first anniversary of the launch of abx cbl and the timing of reimbursement varies depending on abx cbl s sales 
in march  we issued a million convertible note due march  this note bears interest at the rate of through march  and thereafter at the rate of on any overdue amount 
the interest is payable semi annually in september and march 
the note  or any portion thereof  is convertible at the option of the holder at any time before march  into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each  of principal amount 
we received net proceeds of  in may  we received a loan of million from abbott laboratories 
the loan bears interest at  payable annually 
the loan matures on december   and can be pre paid without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
in february  the company repaid million on the loan 
notes payable include  and  at december  and  respectively  representing the current accreted value of the non interest bearing note issued in connection with the acquisition of imtix 
the note was discounted at a rate of and the remaining unpaid balance of million at december  is payable as follows million in  and million in in fiscal years  and we purchased   and  respectively  of new property and equipment 
in fiscal year purchases consisted primarily of manufacturing and other equipment 
in fiscal years and this purchasing consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters in fremont  california and expenditures associated with the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning erp system 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
such carryforwards expire beginning in through in addition  we had available research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state tax purposes respectively 
the federal tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in through and the state tax credit carryforwards have no expiration dates 
our ability to realize the benefits of the nol and credit carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the respective taxing jurisdictions prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to avail ourselves of such benefits 
furthermore  utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
we believe we have sufficient funds to continue operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through additional financings  including private or public equity and or debt offerings and collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners in order to pursue new business opportunities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the status of competitive products  the maintenance of our manufacturing facility and the establishment of third party manufacturing arrangements  the maintenance of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and the costs of manufacturing scale up and working capital requirements for inventory and financing of accounts receivable 
euro currency the single european currency euro was introduced on january  with complete transition to this new currency required by january we have completed all necessary changes to our internal systems and have fully transitioned to the euro 
we expect that use of the euro may affect our foreign exchange activities and may result in increased fluctuations in foreign currency results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows  as we had no stand alone or embedded derivatives at december  and had not historically entered into any derivative transactions to hedge currency or other exposures 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
we adopted the applicable disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in our consolidated financial statements as of december  and adopted the remaining provision of sfas no 
on april  we have concluded that the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
after march  did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we will adopt sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning january  we are in the process of evaluating existing goodwill and intangibles under the transitional impairment test in sfas no 
and  accordingly  have not yet determined whether or not there will be an impairment loss 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a change in accounting principle 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june   however early application is permitted 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this statement on our financial condition and operating results 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas no 
on january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity security prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount  which is consistent with the estimated effects at december  we generally have the ability to hold fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
substantially all of our long term obligations bear interest at fixed rates which are not subject to future increases in interest rates 
the fair value of these long term obligations  including current portion  at december  was million compared to book value of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corresponding fair value at december  was million compared to book value of million 
we therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
if our notes payable and convertible debt were subject to rate fluctuation  a hypothetical interest rate increase of would have added approximately  to our interest expense for and  for december  expected maturity date total fair value liabilities in thousands long term debt fixed rate denominated average interest rate variable rate denominated average interest rate total equity price risk 
following the sale of our portfolio of corporate equity securities in december and january for a net gain of  we no longer hold any such securities 
foreign currency risk 
many of our foreign sales are invoiced in local currencies  creating receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro and the japanese yen 
the risk due to foreign currency fluctuation associated with these receivables is partially reduced by local payables denominated in the same currencies  and presently we do not consider it necessary to hedge these exposures 
we intend to re assess our hedging policy from time to time as our foreign operations change 
a movement in the currency exchange rate would not have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december  and actual results may differ materially
