overview we are a leading provider of metropolitan area networking solutions that enable service providers to convert raw bandwidth into profitable services over legacy and next generation infrastructures 
our products consist of advanced routers that enable service providers to offer a wide range of products and services that increase revenue and maintain customer loyalty 
riverstone was created by the combination of two businesses previously acquired by cabletron 
these businesses are zeitnet  which cabletron acquired in  and yago systems  which cabletron acquired in the majority of our net revenues come from sales of our routers 
in fiscal year  british telecom accounted for of our net revenues  earthlink accounted for of our net revenues  metricom accounted for of our net revenues  and vitts networks accounted for of our net revenues 
in fiscal year  telseon accounted for of our net revenues 
in fiscal year  no individual customer accounted for or more of our net revenues 
we began shipping products outside the united states in fiscal year  and these shipments accounted for of our net revenues during fiscal year  of our net revenues during fiscal year and of our net revenues during fiscal year our industry has experienced erosion of average selling prices 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  which may reduce our gross margins or revenues 
we expect our quarterly gross margins to fluctuate with changes in our product mix 
most of our sales within the united states have been through direct sales channels 
we intend to add and maintain a limited number of strategic distribution relationships that complement our direct sales efforts 
international sales are made through a combination of direct and indirect sale efforts 
in fiscal we initiated sales and marketing efforts internationally  focusing initially on europe and asia 
as part of this effort  we have negotiated separate reseller agreements with various network integrators in europe and asia 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec recently advised companies to review their critical accounting policies and practices in the context of their financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of such financial statements to ensure that important information is communicated to facilitate an investor s understanding of a company s results of operations fr cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  our most important accounting policies often require us to make estimates and judgments of uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our results of operations during the period reported and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related warranty accounting 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is deemed probable 
if uncertainties exist  revenue is recognized when these uncertainties are resolved 
revenues from service and maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the period the services are performed  typically twelve months or less 
when we make sales to international network integrators and value added resellers  in some cases they are given privileges to return a portion of inventory up to a maximum amount with placement of new orders for an equivalent amount of product 
we accrue estimated warranty costs and sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment based on contractual rights and historical experience 
if the historical data we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances do not properly reflect future returns  a change in accruals for sales returns and allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination was made and our revenues could be adversely affected 
additionally  if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
lease financing 
we enter into transactions in which customers receive financing for the purchase of company equipment from third party leasing organizations  who in turn remit payment to us 
in certain transactions during fiscal year  the company guaranteed a portion of the customer s lease payments to be made to the lessor 
we record these transactions consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases sfas and related interpretations 
substantially all of our customer leasing transactions involve capital leases 
when we provide a financing guarantee  we record revenue at the time of shipment  subject to a sales reserve 
we base the amount of the reserve on a percentage of the guaranteed lease payments  based on specific customer analysis supplemented with industry experience 
accordingly  we have deferred revenue subject to this reserve that will be recognized by the end of the respective lease terms if all lease payments are made by end users 
as of march  and march   we had guaranteed payments associated with lease transactions of approximately million and million  respectively 
if the customer defaults are higher than our historical experience  an increase in sales reserves would be made in the period in which such a determination was made and our revenues could be adversely affected 
inventories 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
while we believe that our provision for excess and obsolete inventory is adequate  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology  we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
accounts receivable 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experiences 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate  if there is a sudden deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
strategic investments 
as part of our long term strategy  we have made investments in equity and convertible debt of public and private companies 
the investees are generally companies in the telecommunications industry that have received and are expected to continue to receive funding from top tier venture capital firms  have passed a credit review consistent with other of our customers and have a sound business model and experienced management team 
we hold less than of the equity of each of these companies and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
accordingly  these investments are accounted for using the cost method 
we use independent valuations or recent third party investments of cash for equity to support the initial carrying value of the investments 
we review the carrying value of these investments at the end of each reporting period to determine if any investments are impaired 
this review includes an evaluation of historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
other than temporary impairments are recognized in earnings if the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for more than six months or the issuer has experienced significant financial declines or difficulties in raising capital to continue operations 
our ability to recover investments from these investees is largely dependent on equity market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers  and private sales 
all of these factors are difficult to predict  particularly in the current economic environment and our net income in the future could be adversely affected by investment impairment charges 
if one or more of our investees experience a significant financial decline  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us  if any  from these investees could be adversely affected 
the strategic investments are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
basis of presentation our fiscal year ended on february  effective march   we changed our year end to a week fiscal year  ending on the saturday closest to the last calendar day in february 
through august   riverstone was a subsidiary of cabletron 
through this date  our consolidated financial statements have been taken from the consolidated financial statements of cabletron using historical results of operations and historical bases of the assets and liabilities attributable to our operations 
through august   the consolidated financial statements also included allocations to us of cabletron corporate expenses  including centralized legal  accounting  treasury  real estate  information technology  distribution  customer services  sales  marketing  engineering and other corporate services and infrastructure costs 
all of the allocations and estimates in our financial statements were based upon assumptions that our management and cabletron s management believed to be reasonable reflections of the cost of services provided or benefit received by us 
the financial information presented herein is not indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future  nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone company for the periods presented 
results of operations the following table shows consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended mar  mar  feb  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income interest expense loss on investments net loss before income taxes income taxes net loss net revenues 
net revenues were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from fiscal year to and million or from fiscal year to the increases in net revenues were primarily due to the addition of new service provider customers both in the united states and internationally 
international sales increased by and and domestic sales increased by and in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the economic downturn and the reduction of capital spending by our existing and potential customers adversely impacted our product demand and made it increasingly difficult to accurately forecast our future revenues  as evidenced by declining quarterly revenues during our fourth quarter 
the current economic conditions may cause future revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
in order to establish relationships with companies in markets consistent with our long term strategic direction  we have invested in equity and convertible debt of private and public companies that are also our customers 
during fiscal year  sales to these strategic investee companies represented of our net revenues  with sales to no one investee company exceeding of our net revenues 
additionally  sales to companies in which cabletron held investments at the time of the sales represented of our net revenues 
during fiscal years and  sales to companies in which cabletron held investments represented and of our net revenues  respectively 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes costs of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead and amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  and other costs related to warranty and contractual obligations and customer service and support 
cost of revenues was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from fiscal year to and million or from fiscal year to cost of revenues was  and of net revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues for all periods is primarily related to the increase in net revenues 
the improvements in gross margins are primarily attributable to decreased component prices and economies of scale achieved from increased sales levels 
our gross margins are highly variable and could decline in the future due to many factors such as our and our competitors pricing policies  increased warranty costs and new product introductions by us or by our competitors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultants and outside service provider fees  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs related to the development  testing and enhancement of our asics and software  and the depreciation of property and equipment related to these activities 
our research and development efforts can require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from fiscal year to and million or from fiscal year to the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal related primarily to increased expenditures on the design and development of our new products 
approximately million of the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal related to cabletron s transfer to us of its research and development group based in reading  england during the first quarter of fiscal year historically  these engineers worked on cabletron s products 
the remaining increases for fiscal and resulted from increased personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal year  and  respectively 
we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development are critical to attain our strategic objectives and we expect our research and development expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars as we continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  and trade shows  advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses excluding stock based compensation were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from fiscal year to and million or from fiscal year to the increases in sales and marketing expenses during these periods resulted primarily from the addition of sales and marketing personnel to support increased sales and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect these expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollars during fiscal year as we support our products and market segments 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses  professional and contractor fees  finance  legal  facilities  human resources and provisions for doubtful accounts 
through august   included in general and administrative expenses are expenses for services provided by cabletron under our services agreement with them 
before the effective date of the services agreement  march   cabletron allocated to us general and administrative expenses that it incurred on our behalf  based on headcount and revenue 
general and administrative expenses excluding stock based compensation were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from fiscal year to and million or from fiscal year to the increase from fiscal year to was due to a million increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a result of the impact of the deteriorating economy on our customer base and increased general corporate expenses 
the increase from fiscal year to was primarily due to the addition of personnel to support the increase in revenue and general corporate expenses consistent with the increased scale of operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollars during fiscal year stock based compensation 
we recorded total unearned stock based compensation of million during the twelve months ended march   related to stock option grants to employees based on the excess of the determined fair market value over the exercise price at the date of grant and for an individual who changed employment status from cabletron to riverstone  of which approximately million and million was expensed as stock based compensation during fiscal year and  respectively 
this expense was classified as cost of revenues or operating expense depending upon the classification of the respective employees 
we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense during the twelve months ended march   relating to stock option grants to employees of cabletron and enterasys of which million related to the acceleration of vesting of these options during our third quarter of fiscal year we recorded approximately  and million of compensation expense related to options granted to consultants during fiscal year and  respectively 
we also recorded  of stock based compensation related to stock option grant modifications during fiscal year restructuring charges 
on february   we announced a restructuring in an effort to better align our business operations with the current market as well as service provider and carrier industry conditions 
the restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction  discontinuance of certain products and an asset write off related to the workforce reduction and discontinued product line 
the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of approximately employees across all business functions 
for the year ended march   we recorded charges of approximately million  million and million relating to severance  discontinued product line and asset write offs  respectively 
we expect that the restructuring will result in an approximately million reduction in annual salary and other payroll related expenses 
loss on investments 
the company has invested in equity and convertible debt of certain public and private companies 
these investments have been made to establish relationships with companies in markets that the company believes are consistent with its long term strategic direction 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  certain private companies in which we held investments were experiencing financial declines and were not likely to have sufficient cash flows to operate in the next twelve months 
as a result  we determined that investments in these investees had declined in fair value on an other than temporary basis and accordingly recorded impairment write downs of our minority equity and convertible debt investments of million 
interest and other income  net 
interest income is earned on funds we keep on deposit in interest bearing money market  short term investment and long term investment accounts 
riverstone had interest income of million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
during  we recorded no interest income as cash was managed centrally by cabletron 
interest income increased significantly during fiscal years and due to higher cash balances resulting from the proceeds from our initial public offering on february   the sale of our common stock to cabletron in july and the issuance of convertible notes in november interest expense 
interest expense was million   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest expense in fiscal year consisted of accrued interest and amortization of debt issuance costs  both attributable to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in november  as well as interest on trade accounts receivable that were sold to an unrelated financial institution 
interest expense in fiscal years and is related to a note payable associated with a financing arrangement to provide equipment financing assumed as part of the yago acquisition 
borrowings under this arrangement carried interest at an effective rate of and were repaid fully during fiscal year income taxes 
we recorded a  provision for income taxes in fiscal primarily due to state minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 
prior to our being spun off from cabletron on august   our operating results were included in cabletron s consolidated  combined or unitary federal  state and foreign income tax returns 
effective as of august   we will file our united states federal  state and foreign income tax returns on a separate basis 
our provision for income taxes has been determined on a separate company return method for fiscal  and we have not recognized any deferred income tax benefit for net operating losses incurred in fiscal  and because cabletron utilized certain of our net operating losses incurred prior to the contribution of the cabletron owned assets relating to our business to us on august  and the balance of our net operating losses represent deferred tax assets we have inherited in the spin off transaction for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance 
under a separate company return method and due to our history of operating losses  our management has concluded that  after considering all the available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be not be realized 
effective as of june  and in anticipation of the august  contribution to riverstone of the cabletron owned assets related to the riverstone business  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with cabletron 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  cabletron is required to reimburse us for any tax net operating losses attributable to us that are used by cabletron  and we are required to reimburse cabletron for any tax liabilities attributable to us that are paid by cabletron 
no amounts were paid to or received from cabletron in fiscal year and in connection with the tax sharing agreement and there were no outstanding amounts due to or from cabletron as of march  we are in the process of establishing foreign subsidiaries in various foreign countries with different rates of tax to facilitate the expansion of our international business operations 
as a result  we anticipate that our mix of domestic and foreign income before taxes in the various taxing jurisdictions may fluctuate between each quarter and this could cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate in fiscal liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  cabletron administered our cash 
we transferred cash receipts related to our business to cabletron periodically  and cabletron provided funds to cover our disbursements 
we completed our initial public offering in february and realized net proceeds of million 
at completion of our initial public offering  we also received million from the exercise of stock purchase rights by strategic investors 
on july   we issued  shares of our common stock to cabletron in exchange for approximately million in cash and certain strategic investments with a historic cost of approximately million 
in november we completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
the company has a million credit facility available under a revolving line of credit 
this borrowing facility does not require compliance with any financial covenants and can be withdrawn by the financial institution at anytime 
at march  there was no indebtedness outstanding under this credit facility 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable short term investments of million and marketable long term investments of million 
cash equivalents consisted of government and non government debt securities and money market funds with original maturities of less than days 
short term and long term investments were comprised of commercial paper  and government and non government debt securities with original maturities greater than days 
despite our net loss of million  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year primarily due to non cash charges such as amortization and depreciation  write down of private equity securities and provisions for losses on accounts receivable 
our working capital needs consumed cash in as increases in accounts receivable and inventory were greater than increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year cash used by operating activities in these periods was primarily attributable to general operating expenses  increases in accounts receivable resulting primarily from the addition of new service provider customers  and increases in inventories and other working capital items 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of million of capital expenditures  purchases of million of restricted investments and million of strategic investments in private and public companies  and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
investing activities consisted of million of capital expenditures and million in purchases of marketable securities in fiscal year investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million in fiscal year capital expenditures during all periods include production equipment  research and development equipment  computers  enterprise resource planning software applications and facility related improvements 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal year cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes of approximately million  and proceeds of option exercises and issuances of common stock of million 
in fiscal year cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from our initial public offering of million  million from the issuance of stock purchase rights to the strategic investors and million from exercise of the stock purchase rights 
we also received net transfers from cabletron under our cash administration arrangements with them of million in in fiscal year the funds received from cabletron were million 
we currently have operating lease commitments of million  convertible subordinated notes of million due december and standby letters of credit relating to lease guarantees of million 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for details of our restricted cash  future debt payment obligations and operating lease commitments 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of the expansion of our business  resources we devote to developing our products and market acceptance of our products 
we anticipate devoting substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to hire and expand our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  and for other general corporate activities and infrastructure 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  from time to time  we may also consider the acquisition of products and businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investments may require additional capital 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable short and long term investments together with our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures over the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  sfas requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investment no longer be amortized 
we will apply sfas beginning the first quarter of fiscal year application of the non amortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in us not recognizing amortization expense of approximately million in we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we will perform the transitional test within months of march   in accordance with the provisions of sfas any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisitions  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
we are required to adopt sfas in fiscal and we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of business of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
we are required to adopt sfas in fiscal and we have not yet determined what effect  if any  the adoptions of sfas will have on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock factors related to our business we have a general history of losses and cannot assure you that we will operate profitably in the future 
we have not yet achieved profitability on an annual basis  and we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future 
portions of our financial data are based on cabletron s financial statements 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
we anticipate incurring significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses  requiring us to realize significantly higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
because the united states  europe and asia pacific are experiencing an economic slowdown  our ability to increase or sustain our revenues may be limited 
the events on september in new york  ny and washington  ny and other terrorist attacks  as well as concerns regarding any related conflicts or similar events worldwide  have increased the uncertainty in the us these events have decreased our ability to project our revenue in future quarters and may decrease the amount of funds our customers commit to information technology infrastructure spending 
any reduction in or delay of capital spending by our customers due to the events of september and recent economic  political and social turmoil will reduce our future revenue and profitability 
our exclusive focus on sales to service provider customers subjects us to risks that may be greater than those for providers with a more diverse customer base 
our customers consist of local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  internet service providers  metropolitan service providers  content hosting providers and cable operators whose businesses depend on the continuing demand for differentiated services by their customers 
if this demand does not continue or the internet does not continue to expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial marketplace  the demand for our products could decline 
our exposure to this risk is greater than it is for other vendors who sell to a more diversified customer base 
we believe that there are risks arising from doing business with service providers in these markets that may not be faced by our competitors in their relationships with corporate and other customers  including any failure of a service provider s service to its customers that it attributes to our products  whether or not our products actually failed  which could lead to substantial negative publicity and undermine our sales  the low level of brand loyalty demonstrated by service providers  which may cause them to switch to another supplier that provides  or that they believe provides  superior performance or cost effectiveness  the introduction  or the planned introduction  of new products and product enhancements  which could cause service providers to cancel  reduce or delay existing orders  and service providers that are heavily dependent upon financing  particularly from the high yield debt market  to build out their infrastructure  who may decrease their infrastructure purchases if interest rates increase or if credit availability in these markets decreases 
the occurrence of one or more of these events is likely to harm our operating results 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate  particularly as we expand and if  as expected  our expenses rise  which could cause us to miss quarterly revenue targets and result in a decline in our stock price 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
a high percentage of our expenses remain relatively fixed despite changes in revenue  including marketing  research and development and general administrative expenses and expenses for employee compensation other than sales commissions 
this means that any failure to achieve anticipated revenues could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including fluctuations in demand for our products and services  unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  the timing and amount of non cash stock based compensation charges  our ability and our suppliers abilities to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  and write downs resulting from other than temporary declines in value of our investments in equity and convertible debt investees 
due to these factors  we believe that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of our future performance 
we generally do not have binding commitments from our customers and if significant customers cancel  reduce or delay a large purchase  our revenues may decline and the price of our stock may fall 
historically  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
for fiscal year  british telecom accounted for of our net revenues  earthlink accounted for of our net revenues  metricom accounted for of our net revenues and vitts networks accounted for of our net revenues 
for fiscal year  telseon accounted for of our net revenues 
for fiscal year no individual customer accounted for or more of our net revenues 
customers making large purchases from us are likely to vary over time  due to changes in our product cycles  customer needs  competition or economic circumstances 
two of our former significant customers  vitts networks and metricom  have filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations and tellabs has terminated its agreement with us 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend significantly on large orders from a small number of customers 
we generally do not have binding commitments from our customers 
if any of our large customers cancels  reduces or delays purchases  our revenues and profitability would be harmed because of our dependence on large customers 
because the purchase of our products often represents a significant decision on the part of potential customers  we may expend significant resources on potential customers without achieving actual sales 
purchases of our products often represent a significant strategic decision and capital investment by our customers related to their communications infrastructure and typically involve significant internal procedures involving the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales process  often ranging from one month to longer than a year  and purchases of our products are subject to a number of significant risks  including customer budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
during this time we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
the length of the sales cycle  and the magnitude of our investment in the sales process  is more substantial for our service provider customers than it would typically be with corporate customers 
if sales forecasts from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results 
we may be unable to expand our sales and direct and indirect distribution channels  which may hinder our ability to target multiple levels of a prospective customer s organization as well as our ability to increase sales and revenues 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales and marketing effort targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
unless we expand our sales force and maintain high levels of marketing activity  we will be unable to increase revenues 
although we plan to continue to hire additional sales personnel  competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we may be unable to hire the sales personnel we require 
our sales and distribution strategy relies on value added resellers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  our direct and indirect international sales efforts and our ability to package our products into a complete network infrastructure solution by working with other technology vendors 
if we are unable to establish new value added reseller or oem relationships  or if our oems and valued added resellers are unsuccessful in distributing our products  our sales could suffer 
because we are not a vertically integrated network infrastructure provider  if we fail to maintain existing technology vendor relationships or to establish new ones  we will be unable to satisfy our customers need for complete  fully integrated solutions and our business could suffer 
certain of our customers rely on us to arrange financing for our products  which subjects us to credit and market risks 
certain of our customers do not have or do not wish to commit the financial resources necessary to purchase our products without financing  and these customers expect us to arrange their financing 
these financing arrangements can expose us to our customers credit risks and in the past we have experienced customer defaults 
due to recent public market volatility  a number of our current or prospective customers may be unable to raise funding through the issuance of their equity securities 
this difficulty could result in an increased need for financing provided either by us or with our assistance and an increased risk of customer default 
at march  the company s guaranteed lease payments amounted to million 
in the past  we benefited from cabletron s resources and credit in arranging financing for our customers 
as a result of our separation from cabletron  we are a much smaller  stand alone company  which could impair our ability to provide or arrange and support customer financing 
if third party financing were to become less available due to credit market factors  our ability to arrange third party financing for our customers could be significantly limited  potentially resulting in reduced revenues 
we purchase several key components for our products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs 
we purchase several key components used in the manufacturing of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
we have worked with nec  agere and lsi logic to develop several of our key proprietary application specific integrated circuits  or asics 
these proprietary asics are very complex  and nec  agere and lsi logic are our sole source suppliers for the specific types of asics that they supply to us 
we do not have a long term fixed price or minimum volume agreement with either of these suppliers 
should we encounter problems with nec  agere or lsi logic  we may not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner  which could hurt our ability to deliver our routers 
we base our purchasing decisions on a forecast of anticipated orders of our products  and if we miscalculate our needs or are not able to obtain necessary components  our business could be harmed 
we use a forward looking forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements  and if customer orders do not match forecasts  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components 
in the past  we have experienced shortages of some components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics during initial product development  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
if we cannot obtain necessary components  we may not be able to meet customer orders and our business and results of operations could suffer 
we depend on a single contract manufacturer for all of our manufacturing requirements  and a failure by this contract manufacturer would impair our ability to deliver products 
we outsource all of our manufacturing to one company  flextronics international  ltd  which manufactures our products in san jose  california 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases and our contract manufacturing capacity with flextronics or add additional contract manufacturers 
our existing and future contract manufacturer may not meet our future requirements 
we have experienced a delay in product shipments from our contract manufacturer in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar and other problems  such as insufficient quantity of product  which could materially harm our business and operating results 
the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of our contract manufacturer would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a significant negative effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
substantially all of our revenues come from sales of our rs router family  making us dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products 
substantially all of our revenues result from sales of our rs router family 
continuing market acceptance of our products is critical to our future success  and we are more dependent on the market acceptance of an individual product family than competitors with broader product offerings 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products include adoption of advanced routing and switching products and technologies  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  brand recognition of the riverstone name  and the success and development of our sales and marketing organizations and resellers 
if we fail to achieve and maintain market acceptance for our rs router family  our revenues may be harmed 
the market for network equipment is subject to rapid technological change  and if we fail to accurately predict and respond to market developments or demands  we will be unable to compete successfully 
the market for network equipment is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on our successful development and introduction and the market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements in a cost effective manner 
we may be unsuccessful in completing the development or introduction of these product enhancements or new products on a timely basis or at all 
the failure of these enhancements or new products to operate as expected could delay or prevent future sales 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our product 
alternative technologies and customer requirements could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the technologies  protocols and service requirements on which our product lines are based 
our technological approach may not achieve broad market acceptance  and other technologies or devices may supplant our approach 
if we are unable to deliver the high level of customer service and support demanded by our customers  we may lose customers and our operating results will suffer 
our customers demand a high level of customer service and support 
our customer service and support functions are provided by our internal product support groups 
we have recently transitioned all of these functions from a combination of internal and external support to our internal customer service group  rtac group  and field technical support group 
if we are unable to manage these functions internally and satisfy our customers with a high level of service and support  any resulting customer dissatisfaction could impair our ability to retain customers and make future sales 
we have also considered  and could consider in the future  using other third parties to provide certain customer support services 
we may be unable to manage effectively those third parties who may provide support services for us and they may provide inadequate levels of customer support 
our products are very complex and undetected defects may increase our costs and harm our reputation with our customers 
networking products are extremely complex and must operate successfully with equally complex products of other vendors 
these products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new upgrades are released 
additionally  the pressures we face to be the first to market new products increases the possibility that we will offer products in which we or our customers later discover errors 
we have experienced new product and product upgrade errors in the past and may experience similar problems in the future 
these problems could result in our incurring significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems and our stock price to fall 
we have limited ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions using our equity because of the federal income tax requirements for a tax free distribution 
for the distribution of our stock by cabletron now known as enterasys to qualify as tax free to enterasys there must not be a change in ownership of or greater in either the voting power or value of either our stock or cabletron s stock that is considered to be part of a plan or series of transactions related to the distribution 
if there is a direct or indirect acquisition of our or enterasys stock by one or more persons during the four year period beginning two years before and ending two years after the distribution  it will be presumed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions related to enterasys intended distribution of our stock 
unless this presumption is successfully rebutted  the distribution will be taxable to enterasys 
we have entered into a tax sharing agreement with enterasys and aprisma 
this agreement requires us to indemnify the other parties if the distribution by cabletron of its riverstone shares does not qualify as tax free due to actions we take or that otherwise relate to us  including any change of ownership of us 
the process for determining whether a change of ownership has occurred under the tax rules is complex 
if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with these rules  we might inadvertently cause a change of ownership to occur  triggering our obligation to indemnify enterasys and the other parties to the tax sharing agreement 
our obligation to indemnify these parties if a change of ownership causes the distribution not to be tax free could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
the amount of any such indemnification would be substantial 
for the reasons described above  our ability to use our stock for acquisitions and other similar strategic transactions or for compensation for employees and others is restricted 
many of our competitors use their equity to complete acquisitions  to expand their product offerings and speed the development of new technology and to attract and retain employees and other key personnel  giving them a potentially significant competitive advantage over us 
we jointly own with enterasys some of our intellectual property  and our business could be harmed if enterasys uses this intellectual property to compete with us 
intellectual property that relates to a family of asics used in both our rs router family and enterasys smart switch router product family is owned jointly by enterasys and us 
enterasys is primarily a provider of local area network products for the enterprise market 
there are no contractual provisions that prohibit enterasys from developing products that are competitive with our products  including products based upon the jointly owned intellectual property 
if enterasys is acquired by one of our competitors  there are no contractual provisions that would prohibit the combined company from developing products competitive with our products 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may hinder our ability to compete 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential information to protect our intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that any patents that we hold will protect our intellectual property or will not be challenged by third parties 
other parties may also independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe upon our patents 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property infringes upon the proprietary rights of others  and a successful claim could harm our ability to sell and develop our products 
if other parties claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property we would be forced to defend ourselves or our customers  manufacturers or suppliers against those claims 
we could incur substantial costs to prosecute or defend those claims 
a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed technology on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we continue to expand our international sales effort  and marketing and distributing our products outside of the united states may require increased expenses and greater exposure to risks that we may not be able to successfully address 
our growth strategy depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations 
international sales increased to of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the international market for our products is less mature than the market in the united states  and our strategy of selling to service providers that operate in the metropolitan area network may be unsuccessful on an international basis 
operating internationally exposes us to risks such as longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing operations across disparate geographic areas and tariffs  export controls and other trade barriers 
we conduct our international sales in either us dollars or local currencies and a change in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we are also subject to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
we may determine to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of fluctuations  and if we are not successful in managing hedging transactions  we could incur losses 
if we fail to address the strain on our resources caused by our growth or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to achieve our objectives and our business could be harmed 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion  which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
from february  to march   the number of our employees increased from to our management team has only been recently formed and has had limited experience managing rapidly growing companies 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success is highly dependent on romulus pereira  our president and chief executive officer 
we believe our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance  customer support and manufacturing personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty hiring employees in the time frame we desire  particularly software and hardware engineers 
we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
we rely on independent service providers to supply certain of our back office functions  and if they fail to deliver adequate services  our business will suffer 
we rely on service providers to supply us with many of our operational and back office functions  including human resources applications  enterprise resource management applications and customer relationship management applications 
although these functions are critical to our business  we neither own the software that performs these functions nor  in some cases  the hardware on which these programs and our data reside 
if there is a significant degradation or failure in service  we may be unable to quickly and cost effectively transition to other service providers or provide the necessary functionality ourselves and our business could be disrupted 
we face risks associated with our strategic investments and may not realize the anticipated benefits of such investments 
in order to establish relationships with companies in markets consistent with our long term strategic direction  we have invested in equity and convertible debt of private and public companies 
as of march   the fair market value of these investments totaled approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended march   sales to these strategic investee companies represented of net revenues  with sales to no one investee company exceeding of net revenues 
additionally  sales to companies in which cabletron held investments at the time of the sales represented of net revenues 
we plan to continue to make strategic investments in the future 
however  we may not realize in full the anticipated benefits of our current and future strategic investments 
the companies in which we invest may not make  may reduce or may terminate product purchases from us 
we may lose all or a portion of the amount invested 
we assess the fair value of our strategic investments quarterly and may be required to record impairment charges against our strategic investments 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   certain private companies in which we held investments were experiencing financial declines and were not likely to be able to raise capital to continue operations 
as a result  we determined that investments in these investees had declined in fair market value on an other than temporary basis and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million against strategic investments 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment charge include the likelihood that the related company would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the operating performance or operating model  and or changes in market conditions 
if we determine to reduce the carrying value of one of our investments  such a reduction could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
factors related to our industry intense competition in the market for network equipment could prevent us from increasing revenues and sustaining profitability 
the market for network equipment is very competitive and has historically been dominated by cisco systems 
other principal competitors include established companies such as extreme networks  inc  foundry networks  inc  juniper networks  inc  nortel networks corporation and other smaller public and private companies 
these competitors may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even make our products obsolete 
consolidation in our industry is occurring and is likely to continue 
future acquisitions by  and mergers among  our competitors and potential competitors could expand their product offerings and accelerate their development of new technologies  providing them with a competitive advantage 
many of our competitors have significantly more established customer support and professional services organizations and substantially greater financial resources than we do 
many of our competitors also have much greater name recognition and have a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships and product offerings than we do 
these companies can rely on their customer bases and broader product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  which would materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease rapidly  which may reduce our gross margins or revenues 
our industry has experienced rapid erosion of average selling prices 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors and increasing availability of relatively inexpensive standard microprocessors that can perform some of our products functionality 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient cost reductions and increases in sales volumes  this decline in average selling prices will reduce our revenues and gross margins 
if our products do not comply with complex governmental regulations and evolving industry standards  our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability 
the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
to be competitive  we must continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
we have had to delay the introduction of new products to comply with third party standards testing 
we may be unable to address compatibility and interoperability issues that arise from technological changes and evolving industry standards 
in the united states  our products must comply with various governmental regulations and industry regulations and standards  including those defined by the federal communications commission  underwriters laboratories and nebs 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards or obtain certifications established by telecommunications authorities in various countries and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we will be unable to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving or maintaining profitability 
factors related to our separation from cabletron our historical financial information may not be representative of our results as a separate company 
our consolidated financial statements are based on the consolidated financial statements of cabletron  using the historical results of operations and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of the cabletron router and switch business contributed to us 
the historical financial information we have included in this annual report on form k does not necessarily reflect what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
cabletron did not account for us as a separate  stand alone entity before june  our costs and expenses include allocations from cabletron for centralized corporate services and infrastructure costs  including customer service  sales  information technology  distribution  legal and accounting  real estate  and treasury 
these allocations have been determined on bases that we and cabletron considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us 
the historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
we have not made adjustments to our historical financial information to reflect many significant changes related to our cost structure  funding and operations due to our separation from cabletron  including increased costs from reduced economies of scale  increased marketing expenses related to building a company brand identity separate from cabletron and the increased costs of being a publicly traded  stand alone company 
cabletron no longer provides us with administrative services  and we no longer use cabletron s operational and administrative infrastructure 
our ability to operate our business may suffer if we do not successfully replace this infrastructure and these services 
under a services agreement  prior to its distribution of our common stock  we used cabletron s administrative infrastructure and cabletron provided us centralized corporate functions  including legal  accounting  payroll and other services 
if we are not successful in replacing the services and infrastructure systems previously provided by cabletron  or if there is a failure or significant downtime in our systems  our business could be harmed 
to successfully implement and operate our own systems  we must be able to attract and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees 
we cannot rely on cabletron to fund our future capital requirements  and financing from other sources may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in the past  our capital needs had been satisfied by cabletron 
however  following our separation  cabletron is no longer a source of funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements 
financing or financial support from other sources  if needed  may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we believe our capital requirements will vary greatly from quarter to quarter 
capital expenditures  fluctuations in our operating results  financing activities  acquisitions  investments and inventory and receivables management may contribute to these fluctuations 
we believe that the proceeds from our initial public offering  our sale of common stock to cabletron in july  our issuance of convertible subordinated notes in november and our future cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and research and development requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing to finance acquisitions or other investments in our business 
future equity financings may be dilutive to the existing holders of our common stock 
future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants 
we will likely not be able to obtain debt financing with interest rates and other terms as favorable as those that cabletron could obtain 
the plaintiffs in cabletron s outstanding class action suit might seek to add us to this litigation or seek payment of any related damages 
since december  cabletron has been party to an outstanding class action suit alleging that during the period from march  through december   cabletron released false and misleading information about its operations and that cabletron s accounting practices resulted in the disclosure of materially misleading financial results 
the plaintiffs complaint does not specify the amount of damages  but if the plaintiffs prevail enterasys formerly cabletron could be required to pay substantial damages 
the plaintiffs in this matter might seek to involve us in this litigation or  if they prevail in this litigation  might seek to recover damages from us  particularly if enterasys has insufficient assets 
we face risks related to the pending formal sec investigation of enterasys network and certain of its affiliates 
on january   the securities and exchange commission notified enterasys that it had commenced an order of investigation into enterasys and certain of its affiliates accounting practices 
this sec investigation may cover periods during which riverstone was an affiliate of enterasys 
we have not been notified that we are part of the sec investigation  nor have we received any inquiry with respect to the investigation 
on august   when cabletron distributed all of its shares of our common stock to its stockholders  we ceased to be a subsidiary of cabletron and an affiliate of enterasys 
we have been operating with our management and board of directors since our ipo in february at this point we are unable to predict what  if any  impact the sec inquiry into enterasys prior accounting practices may have on us 
we could be required to take actions not presently contemplated  which could be expensive  divert management s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 
in addition  the ongoing sec inquiry into enterasys may contribute to volatility in the price of our common stock 
conflicts of interest may arise because our directors and executive officers have ownership interests in enterasys and aprisma 
many of our directors and executive officers have a substantial amount of their personal financial portfolios in enterasys common stock and options to purchase enterasys common stock 
our directors also hold options to purchase stock of aprisma 
conflicts of interest may arise between enterasys and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships  including tax  indemnification  intellectual property and other matters arising from our separation from cabletron  which is now enterasys 
these factors could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for enterasys  aprisma and us 
in our certificate of incorporation we have renounced any interest in business opportunities that are presented to cabletron now known as enterasys  its subsidiaries other than us  or our officers or directors who are employees of enterasys or its subsidiaries other than us at the time the opportunity is presented 
we could incur significant tax liability if the distribution does not qualify for tax free treatment  which could require us to pay enterasys a substantial amount of money 
in addition to our liability under the tax sharing agreement with enterasys and aprisma under united states federal income tax laws  we would be jointly and severally liable for the federal income taxes of cabletron resulting from the distribution being taxable 
this means that even if we do not have to indemnify enterasys under the tax sharing agreement because we did not take any specific action to cause the distribution to fail as a tax free event  we may still be liable for any part of  including the whole amount of  these liabilities and expenses if enterasys fails to pay them 
factors related to our stock our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile  and we expect that it will continue to be volatile 
this volatility could result in substantial losses to individual stockholders and holders of our convertible subordinated notes 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of july  each right entitles the holder to purchase upon certain events one one thousandth of a share of our series a preferred stock for under certain circumstances  if a person or group acquire or more of our outstanding common stock  holders of the rights other than the person or group triggering their exercise will be able to purchase  in exchange for the exercise price  shares of our common stock  and in certain cases  shares of stock of a company into which we are merged  having a value of double the exercise price 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock of which  shares have been designated as series a preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of riverstone 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management riverstone s investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments in a variety of forms  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and money market funds 
our portfolio has an average life of one year as of march  we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or fund 
based on our investment portfolio  an interest rate increase or decrease of basis points of our weighted average interest rate as of march   would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million  respectively  in the fair market value of the portfolio 
however  these gains or losses would remain unrealized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
our convertible subordinated notes were issued at a fixed interest rate and with fixed conversion rates and therefore do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes and expose us to a risk of economic loss 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of march   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes and is based on our assumed overall maturity of five years for the long term debt 
the discount rate used was based on the market interest rate in effect at march  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in the interest rate would result in a loss in the fair values of our convertible subordinated debt of approximately million at march  strategic investments risk we have invested in the equity and debt of certain public and private companies to establish relationships with companies in markets that we believe are consistent with our long term strategic direction 
the debt is generally convertible into equity securities of the companies in a relatively short period of time from the investment 
these investments are accounted for using the cost method and are classified in long term investments and other long term assets 
for these investments  at the end of each reporting period we review historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs  and recent funding events in assessing carrying values 
these investments are inherently risky as our ability to recover our investment in these companies is largely dependent on equity market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers  and private sales 
all of these factors are difficult to predict  particularly in the current economic environment 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
to date  we have recognized million related to the impairment of these investments 
foreign currency risk management the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the british pound  the euro and the japanese yen 
the company has established revenue  expense  and balance sheet risk management programs designed to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates 
the company uses currency forward contracts in these risk management programs 
these programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
based upon our currency sensitivity analysis as of march   a hypothetical increase or decrease in the exchange rates of the british pound  the euro and the japanese yen would increase or decrease our earnings by approximately  respectively 
currency forward contracts that are used to hedge exposure to variability in anticipated non us dollar denominated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges 
the maturities of these instruments are generally less than months 
the company had forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies with a us dollar equivalent of million at march  for these derivatives  the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings  and within the same income statement line item 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in interest and other income  net during the period of change 
currency forward contracts are used to offset the currency risk of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the related derivatives  with the resulting net gain or loss  if any  recorded in interest and other income  net 
for currency forward contracts  effectiveness of the hedge is measured using forward rates to value the forward contract and the forward value of the underlying hedged transaction 
any ineffective portions of the hedge  as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness  are recognized currently in interest and other income  net 
if a cash flow hedge were to be discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as anticipated  the unrealized gains or losses would be reclassified into earnings 
subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument would be recognized in income in each period until the instrument matures  is terminated or is sold 
during  the portion of hedging instruments net losses excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had a  impact on earnings for either cash flow or fair value hedges 
no cash flow hedges were discontinued as a result of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
the net realized and unrealized gain from accounts receivable hedges included in other income and other comprehensive income at march  was  and zero respectively  before tax 
the realized and unrealized amounts will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts at the end of each reporting period 
as of march   the company had future contracts with a cost basis of million and an estimated fair value of million 
sales of accounts receivables beginning in fiscal  the company sold trade accounts receivables to an unrelated finance entity  with limited recourse 
the company accounts for the transfer of accounts receivables in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
according to the accounts receivable sale agreements  the company maintains the servicing of these receivables 
in fiscal year  the company sold approximately million in receivables 
the net cash flow from the sale of receivables in any given period represents the discount on sales and is recorded as interest expense 
the discount was approximately million in fiscal at march   million in sold trade accounts receivable remained outstanding 
in conjunction with the accounts receivable sale agreements  the company provides deposits to the finance entity 
at march   the company had a deposit of million with the finance entity
