although bancorp believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
overview bancorp achieved favorable growth in deposits and noninterest income in the year while continuing to maintain strong net income growth and asset quality 
during the year there was a growing concern over the recessionary environment that prompted the federal reserve bank to cut rates  pushing the federal funds rate to a four decade low of 
as a result of the declining rate environment  the federal reserve hoped to increase consumer confidence and spending to reduce the effects of the recession that began in march 
against this background  economic conditions within the bancorp s operating area in maryland remained generally strong and credit quality has remained at traditionally strong levels 
bancorp s net income for totaled million or per diluted share compared with million or per diluted share in  a increase 
return on average equity declined slightly to in from due to an increase in equity attributable to the improved market performance of the investment portfolio 
return on average assets increased to in from the achieved in in average deposits increased million or 
this increase was driven from growth in demand deposits  money market accounts  and certificates of deposit 
in november  the bancorp sold two pennsylvania branches that totaled million in deposits that were acquired  through a previous acquisition 
our principal revenue category  net interest income  grew by in compared to this increase was due to a increase in average earning assets and the net interest margin increasing to from in the prior year 
the stability of the net interest margin during a year when interest rates declined by attests to the effectiveness of bancorp s interest rate risk management practices 
noninterest income grew million to million in versus million in  a increase 
this increase resulted primarily from a significant increase in the mortgage banking business  strong insurance sales and increases in deposit services utilized 
bancorp has made it a strategic priority to grow and diversify its sources of noninterest income 
in the past five years  bancorp has diversified its revenue so that noninterest revenues now comprise over of total revenue  up from in in bancorp s efficiency ratio at  which is a measure of operating cost management  was improved from achieved in total noninterest expense increased over and has been contained to a five year compound growth rate 
asset quality remained at bancorp s traditionally strong levels 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding was 
at year end the allowance for credit losses represented times the level of year end nonperforming loans 
the additional provision for credit losses of thousand over reflects bancorp s conservative approach in factoring in the effects of a recessionary environment and the potential impact on its customers

diluted net income per share results of operations bancorp s operating results for the year reflected strong revenue growth  with total revenues rising million or to million 
increases occurred in both net interest income and fee generating business as bancorp s strategies and growth initiatives continued to generate strong revenue momentum 
credit losses continued to be modest while loan quality remained strong 
bancorp continues to initiate technology enhancements and capitalize on acquisition and consolidation synergies to moderate expense growth 
net interest income net interest income for was million  representing an increase of million or from a increase was achieved in compared to  resulting in net interest income of million 
bancorp s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings

consolidated average balances and rates reveals a relatively stable net interest margin accomplished by significant increases in average earning assets over the three year period ended december  as a result  bancorp was able to achieve tax equivalent net interest income of million in  representing a increase  preceded by million in table analysis of changes in net interest income year ended december  over over due to change in due to change in increase decrease increase decrease volume rates volume rates in thousands interest income interest and fees on loans    interest and dividends on investment securities taxable      tax exempt short term funds   total       interest expense interest on deposits     interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase     interest on other borrowings     total       net interest income      the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
analysis of changes in net interest income reveals that the percentage increase in tax equivalent net interest income for has declined slightly compared to this was attributable to the impact of slower earning asset growth in offset by an improvement in the impact of changing rates 
competitive pricing pressures on loans and deposits have increased in the recessionary environment and present a significant management challenge 
this has heightened the emphasis to diversify revenue streams and requires greater sophistication in net interest margin management 
interest income bancorp s tax equivalent interest income decreased million or in compared to this decline was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets offset by a million increase in those assets 
during  average loans yielding declined million 
this decrease was attributable to prepayments in residential mortgage loans  consumer automobile loans and commercial loans

average total securities yielding increased to million in they represented of average earning assets in as compared to in the growth in the securities portfolio in resulted from the significant deposit growth achieved during the year 
tax equivalent interest income increased or million in compared to  due to significantly higher average earning assets and by a basis point improvement in the average yield earned on these funds

interest rate performance net interest margin  the profit margin achieved on bancorp s earning assets  increased basis points in compared to the net interest spread improved by basis point 
on an average basis  interest rates were lower in than in  and the decline in rates had an equivalent impact on both interest bearing assets and liabilities which was consistent with the bancorp s interest rate risk profile 
the decline in net interest margin was basis points in compared to and the net interest spread declined basis points 
during interest rates declined significantly from the beginning of the first quarter and until year end 
the decrease in the average interest rates earned on assets outpaced the decrease in the average rate paid on deposit accounts largely due to competitive pressure on loan prices and a higher mix of investment securities that earn lower yields than loans 
reducing expensive borrowings and lowering the cost of those borrowings offset the compression on the net interest margin by traditional bank products and services  by basis points 
provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for estimated losses based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
management considers the nature of the loan portfolio  credit concentration trends  historical loan loss experience  specific impaired loans and economic conditions 
management also considers the level of problem assets that the bancorp classifies in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the provision for credit losses was million in which was 
million higher than in this increase in provision resulted primarily from bancorp s conservative approach in factoring in the impact of the recessionary environment on its borrowers 
noninterest income total noninterest income rose million or to million for the year 
growth occurred mainly in gains on sales of loans  insurance income and service charges on deposit accounts 
noninterest income grew or million in versus gains on sales of loans from mortgage banking activities increased million or to million in compared to  after a decline of or thousand in compared to declining interest rates resulted in a shift in consumer demand toward fixed rate mortgages which are generally not held in the loan portfolio but are sold in the market 
lower interest rates also increased refinancing activity  resulting in higher origination fees  which are also included in this category 
these gains reflect a reclassification of miscellaneous loan fees that had no impact on net income

bancorp manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels through active management of the balance sheet 
parent company liquidity comes from short term investments that can be sold immediately and from dividends and interest income from subsidiaries 
at december   f m bancorp had million in interest bearing balances at farmers mechanics bank 
during  amounts available for the payment of dividends aggregated million 
liquidity at the bank is derived from its ability to generate core deposits from a large  diversified customer base and its ability to purchase noncore money market funds in the us the bank s ability to attract funds in the wholesale markets rests on its strength of capital  collateral availability  earnings  reputation and high quality assets 
the bank draws on a diverse base of wholesale funding sources  including large certificates of deposit  federal funds purchased  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the bank also has extensive access to funds from its membership in the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
asset liquidity is maintained through temporary investments  maturity management and the ability to liquidate securities in the available for sale portfolio 
in addition  bancorp limits the level  maturity and concentrations of noncore funding through policy and internal guidelines 
management regularly reviews liquidity positions and reviews liquidity with the board of directors on a semi annual basis 
market risk and asset liability management market risk is defined as the future changes in market prices that increase or decrease the value of financial instruments  ie cash  investments  loans  deposits and debt 
included in market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market risks 
bancorp s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk 
market risk sensitive financial instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
bancorp does not engage in foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of bancorp s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
this risk is driven by potential mismatches resulting in timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and the potential impact of explicit and embedded options 
the goal of asset liability management is to maintain high quality and consistent growth of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates  and acceptable levels of capital and liquidity 
this goal is achieved by influencing the maturity and repricing of business and by managing discretionary portfolios 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on bancorp s earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  bancorp considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
bancorp uses a number of tools to measure interest rate risk including simulating net interest income  monitoring the sensitivity of the net present value of the balance sheet and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that interest rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling which calculates expected net interest income based on projected interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the model projections are based upon historical trends and management s expectations of balance sheet growth patterns  spreads to market rates  historical market rate relationships  prepayment behavior  current and expected product offerings and sales activities 
various sensitivity analyses are performed on a regular basis to segregate interest rate risk into separate components and understand the risk attributable to prepayments  caps and floors and other options 
assumption testing is performed to understand the degree of impact from changing key assumptions such as the speed of prepayments  the interest rate elasticity of core deposit rates and balance sheet growth 
bancorp s policy guideline limit for net interest income simulation is a negative impact to net interest income of for the up or down basis points scenarios when compared with the flat rate scenario 
management has generally maintained a risk position well within the policy guideline level 
the model indicated the impact of a basis point rise in rates over the next months would cause approximately a decrease in net interest income at december  a basis point decrease in rates over the next months would cause approximately a decrease in net interest income 
note that certain short term market rates and a majority of the bank s deposit rates are below 
these rates cannot move below zero in a down basis point scenario 
the impact of this zero percent floor on deposit rates is the primary reason that net interest income is negatively impacted in the down basis point scenario 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and changes in deposit levels 
they are not intended to be a forecast and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management could take in response to changes in interest rates 
capital resources it is bancorp s policy to maintain a level of capital sufficient to protect the company s depositors  creditors and shareholders and to support bancorp s growth 
the principal source of capital is retained earnings 
bancorp monitors historical and projected earnings  dividends  and asset growth  as well as risks associated with various types of on and off balance sheet assets and liabilities  in order to determine appropriate capital levels 
during  total shareholder s equity increased or million to million at december  from million at december  internal capital generation and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted in this increase in total shareholder s equity

under each measure  bancorp and its subsidiaries were substantially in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and  by definition  were well capitalized at december  and in accordance with regulatory guidelines  fair value adjustments to shareholders equity for changes in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale are excluded from the calculations 
effects of changing prices inasmuch as virtually all of a financial institution s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates may have a significant effect on earnings performance 
interest rates  though affected by inflation  do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
movements in interest rates are a result of the perceived changes in the rate of inflation and the effects of monetary and fiscal policies 
reference to net interest income and market risk in this section will assist the reader in understanding how bancorp is positioned to address changing interest rates 
several major categories of noninterest expense are more directly affected by inflationary factors such as salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
management endeavors to overcome or mitigate the effects of inflation by seeking opportunities to improve operating efficiency and productivity and by developing strategies for growth that will exceed the projected rate of inflation 
risk elements nonperforming assets table  nonperforming assets and contractually past due loans  displays a five year history of steadily declining nonperforming assets 
totaling just million  or of total consolidated assets at december   bancorp reduced its nonperforming assets at an average annual rate of over the period shown 
loans that were past due days or more and not classified as nonperforming totaled million at december   or of year end total loans  compared with million one year earlier  or of total loans at december  historically  there has been no direct correlation between loans past due days or more and nonperforming loans or loan losses

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
no interest is taken into income on nonaccrual loans unless received in cash or until such time as the borrower demonstrates sustained performance over a period of time in accordance with contractual terms 
other real estate owned includes real estate acquired by foreclosure in partial or complete satisfaction of debt or otherwise surrendered by the borrower to bancorp s possession 
other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of acquisition or transfer from loans 
write downs to fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
subsequent to transfer  these assets are adjusted through a valuation allowance to the lower of the net carrying value or the fair value net of estimated selling expenses based on periodic appraisals 
nonaccrual loans are not included 
potential problem loans at december   there were million in loans that management had reasonable concerns might become contractually past due or be classified as a nonperforming asset 
these loans are subject to the same close attention and regular credit reviews as extended to loans past due days or more and nonperforming assets 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level  which in management s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management 
additions to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
on a quarterly basis  a comprehensive review of the allowance is performed considering such factors as the levels of loans outstanding  loss experience  delinquency levels  certain individual loan reviews  and an evaluation of the regional and national economic environment 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of three primary elements the formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying historically determined loss factors to outstanding business loans based on credit risk ratings and for pools of homogeneous loans 
individually risk rated loan loss factors are determined using average annual net charge off rates for the most recent two years 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans 
pooled loan loss factors are based on net charge offs experienced over the past year 
the historic loss factors on the risk rated loans and the pooled loans are then considered for either positive or negative adjustment in an attempt to reflect the current dynamics of the portfolios 
these adjustments in the loss factors are tied to management s evaluation of a number of factors including changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  classified and non accrual assets  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in lending policies  underwriting standards  or collection practices  changes in the experience  ability  depth of lending management and staff  portfolio concentrations  and changes in the national or local economy 
specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of non performing loans 
the analysis considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral  or other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to repay 
the unallocated allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  internal audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
as reflected in table  at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and almost eleven times the total non accrual loans 
this compares to an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  equivalent to of total loans and of non accrual loans 
net charge offs during were thousand less than table  analysis of allowance for credit losses shows a five year history of activity reflecting relative stability in both the annual charge off ratio and the level of the allowance related to total loans 
bancorp had loans amounting to approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  that were specifically classified as impaired and included in non accrual loans in table at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  consisting of million representing the formula allowance  a million specific allowance  and a thousand unallocated allowance 
table  allocation of allowance for credit losses  discloses management s allocation of the allowance to various loan categories 
this reflects the underlying trends in loan growth and the change in mix 
as they are estimates  this allocation is not intended to limit the amount of the allowance available to absorb losses from any type of loan and should not be viewed as an indicator of the specific amount or specific loan category in which future charge offs may ultimately occur 
see note  loans  notes to consolidated financial statements  for disclosures pertaining to impaired loans and the specific allowance related thereto 
while management believes the allowance for credit losses was adequate at december   the estimate of losses and related allowance may change in the near term due to economic and other uncertainties inherent in the estimation process
