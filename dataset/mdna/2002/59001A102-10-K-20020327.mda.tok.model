item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include our estimates of costs to complete our individual developments  the ultimate recoverability or impairment of these costs  the likelihood of closing lots held under option or contract and the ability to estimate expenses and accruals  including legal and warranty reserves 
should we under or over estimate costs to complete individual projects  gross margins in a particular period could be misstated and the ultimate recoverability of costs related to a project from individual home sales may be uncertain 
furthermore  non refundable deposits paid for land options or contracts may have no economic value to us if the land is not ultimately purchased 
finally  our inability to accurately estimate expenses or accruals could result in charges or income in the future results of operations related to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
we acquired hancock communities  a homebuilder in the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area  on may  the results discussed below include the operations of hancock communities since its date of acquisition 
the results presented below are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected in the future 
home sales revenue  sales contracts and net sales backlog the tables provided below show operating and financial data regarding our homebuilding activities 
years ended december  home sales revenue in thousands total dollars    homes closed    average sales price texas dollars    homes closed    average sales price arizona dollars    homes closed  average sales price california dollars    homes closed average sales price sales contracts total dollars    homes ordered    average sales price texas dollars    homes ordered    average sales price arizona dollars    homes ordered  average sales price california dollars    homes ordered average sales price december  net sales backlog in thousands total dollars    homes in backlog   average sales price texas dollars    homes in backlog average sales price arizona dollars    homes in backlog average sales price california dollars    homes in backlog average sales price year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales revenue 
the increases in total home sales revenue and number of homes closed in compared to resulted mainly from the strong market activity at the time the orders for these closings were taken in some of our divisions  continued growth in our mid priced communities in arizona and the may addition of hancock communities to our phoenix operations 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in closings in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions in  due to weaker demand in the luxury price segment and a weaker local economy  respectively 
hancock contributed closings with a sales value of approximately million to our results 
the decreases in average home sales prices in arizona for the year reflect a change in our product mix  as we are now selling more first time and first and second time move up homes than in  due in large part to the hancock acquisition 
sales contracts 
sales contracts for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include sales contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
contributing to the increase in sales contracts for the year from the previous year were new contracts from hancock communities acquisition along with strong markets early in the year 
as a whole  we benefited from low mortgage interest rates  generally low unemployment figures and improved home affordability early in we saw declines in new orders in our monterey phoenix  northern california and austin divisions in  and believe this is due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes and weaker local economies in the northern california and austin markets 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate approximating of gross sales  which we believe is consistent with industry norms 
net sales backlog 
backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog from increased homes sales over last year and increased sales prices in some of our markets 
the increase in the number of homes resulted mainly from our hancock acquisition  which contributed homes with a sales value of approximately million to our december   backlog 
backlog in our monterey phoenix  northern california and austin divisions decreased in due to a slowing in demand for higher priced homes and weaker local economies in the northern california and austin markets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales revenue 
the increase in total home sales revenue and number of homes closed in compared to resulted mainly from strong market performance in all of our divisions  as well as the expansion of our operations in northern california and in our mid priced meritage phoenix division in arizona 
the decreases in average home sales prices in arizona and northern california for the year reflect a change in our product mix  as we are sold more mid priced homes in than in sales contracts 
total sales contracts increased in compared to due mainly to the expansion of our operations in northern california and our mid priced meritage phoenix division in arizona  along with continued economic strength of our operating markets during net sales backlog 
total dollar backlog at december   increased over the amount due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog and increased sales prices in most of our markets 
homes in backlog at december   increased over the same period in the prior year 
these increases resulted from expansion of our operations in northern california  and in our mid priced meritage phoenix division in arizona  along with the continued strength of our other markets during other operating information years ended december  home sales gross profit in thousands dollars    percent of home sales revenue commissions and other sales costs dollars    percent of home sales revenue general and administrative expenses dollars    percent of total revenue income taxes dollars    percent of earnings before income taxes and extraordinary items year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales gross profit 
home sales gross profit represents home sales revenue  net of cost of home sales  which include developed lot costs  home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
the dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended december   is attributable to the increase in the number of home closings over closings and to the strong housing demand in our markets at the time these homes were sold 
we were also able to benefit from a reasonably favorable market for home construction materials  which resulted in lower construction cost increases than incurred in prior years 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  were approximately million  or of home sales revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of home sales revenue in the slight decrease in these expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue reflects greater efficiencies in controlling costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the higher expense as a percentage of total revenue in in comparison to resulted from an increase in insurance costs and increased overhead related to our hancock acquisition 
in addition  the increase in the number of closings in our northern california region in resulted in a greater earn out payment per the terms of the purchase contract when we acquired the division 
the earn out  which terminates in june  is calculated based on percent of the pre tax earnings of the northern california region after reduction for a capital charge 
income taxes 
the increase in income taxes to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year resulted from an increase in pre tax income 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes currently payable by approximately million for the year ended december   which resulted in a more favorable tax rate 
the tax benefit was credited to additional paid in capital 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales gross profit 
the dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended december   is attributable to the increase in number of homes closed and continued growth in all of our markets in the gross profit percentage increase in resulted from home pricing increases in many of our communities due to a continued strong homebuilding market and due to decreases in some of our costs of materials resulting from purchasing efficiencies 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs were approximately million  or of home sales revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of home sales revenue in the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue reflects greater efficiency related to economies of scale resulting from revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the higher expense as a percentage of revenue in includes approximately  related to the buyout of an employment agreement of a former managing director 
operating costs in were also higher as a percentage of revenue due to overhead increases incurred related to our california expansion and the start up of our new meritage division in phoenix  arizona 
income taxes 
the increase in income taxes to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year resulted from an increase in pre tax income  partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes currently payable by approximately million for the year ended december  this amount was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of working capital are land purchases  lot development and home construction 
we use a combination of borrowings and funds generated by operations to meet short term working capital requirements and we issue equity or debt in order to meet long term capital requirements 
cash flow for each of our communities depends on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
later  cash flow can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
at december   we had short term secured revolving construction loans and acquisition and development facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
an additional million of unborrowed funds supported by approved collateral were available under our credit facilities at that date  subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants in our loan agreements 
this additional borrowing was limited to approximately million under such loan covenants at december  on may   we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due june  approximately million of this offering was used to complete the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of hancock communities  approximately million was used to pay down existing bank debt  approximately million was used to pay costs related to the bond offering and approximately million was used to repay existing senior notes 
this early repayment of debt resulted in prepayment fees of approximately  which  net of the related income tax benefit  resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately  in the second quarter of in september  we purchased and retired million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes 
the purchases were made at of par at a gain of approximately  which net of related income tax effect of  resulted in an extraordinary gain of  our senior notes require us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the payment of dividends  redemption of equity interests and certain investments  maintenance of a minimum level of consolidated tangible net worth  limitations on liens securing certain obligations  and limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand at december   and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of our other credit agreements 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years senior notes   revolving construction facilities   a d facilities    other borrowing obligations operating lease obligations    recourse option obligations    total     we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we have no derivative financial instruments as of december  and as a component of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties 
the total cost  including land costs  of model homes leased by us and constructed under these lease agreements is million  all of which is excluded from our balance sheet as of december  in may  we announced a stock repurchase program in which our board of directors approved the buyback of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the amount was increased to million in july in we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
as of december    shares had been repurchased for an aggregate price of approximately million 
consolidated cash flow in we used million in cash from our operating and investing activities  and available cash decreased by million 
this decrease in cash was caused primarily by our acquisition of hancock  repayments on our lines of credit and increased purchases of real estate  offset by the issuance of our senior notes 
operating activities used cash of million in  compared with cash generated of million in and cash used of million in the decrease in resulted from increases in our real estate  option deposits and homebuilding assets in conjunction with our increased homebuilding operations and an increase in other assets from the deferred bond costs recorded in connection with the issuance of our senior notes 
cash used in was more than in due to higher real estate purchases in along with higher payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
also  there was no tax benefit from stock option exercises in investing activities used cash of million in  compared with cash of million and million used in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in primarily was due to the hancock acquisition  which used cash of approximately million 
financing activities generated cash of million in  compared with cash used of million in and cash generated of million in the increase in cash generated in mainly was due to the issuance of our senior notes  compared to the cash used of million in compared to cash provided by financing activities in primarily was due to stock repurchases in the amount of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercises of stock options and the borrowings in excess of repayments of debt 
seasonality we historically have closed more homes in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half  due in part to the slightly seasonal nature of the market for our move up and semi custom luxury products 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue  although it may vary as operations continue to expand 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed after june  we adopted sfas no 
upon issuance 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and under the provisions of sfas no 
will no longer be recorded in the future 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we have not determined the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect our future results and financial condition future operating results and financial condition depend on our ability to successfully design  develop  construct and sell homes that satisfy dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are factors that we must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
these operating and financial factors  along with many other factors  could affect the price of our common stock and notes 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition could include the factors discussed below 
homebuilding industry factors 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
these factors can negatively affect the demand for and pricing of our homes 
homebuilders are also subject to various risks  many of which are outside their control  including delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulations  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  and availability and cost of land  materials  and labor 
although the principal raw materials used in the homebuilding industry generally are available from a variety of sources  the materials are subject to periodic price fluctuations 
the homebuilding industry is also subject to the potential for significant variability and fluctuations in real estate availability and values 
write downs of our land inventories could occur if market conditions deteriorate and these write downs could be material in amount 
write downs may also occur if we purchase land at higher prices during stronger economic cycles and the value of that land subsequently declines during slower economic cycles 
fluctuations in operating results 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in home sales and net earnings on a quarterly basis 
as a result of such variability  our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results 
factors that contribute to this variability include timing of home deliveries and land sales  our ability to acquire additional land or options for additional land on acceptable terms  conditions of the real estate market in areas where we operate and of the general economy  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  costs and availability of materials and labor  and delays in construction schedules due to strikes  adverse weather  acts of god  reduced subcontractor availability and governmental restrictions 
interest rates and mortgage financing 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the unavailability of mortgage financing 
most of our buyers finance their home purchases through third party lenders providing mortgage financing 
if mortgage interest rates increase and  consequently  the ability of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected  home sales  gross margins and cash flow may also be adversely impacted and the impact may be material 
our homebuilding activities depend upon the availability and costs of mortgage financing for buyers of homes owned by potential customers  as those customers move up buyers often need to sell their residences before they purchase our homes 
any reduction of financing availability could adversely affect home sales 
changes in federal income tax laws may also affect demand for new homes 
various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to limit the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence 
enactment of such proposals may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general  and on demand for our products in particular 
no meaningful prediction can be made whether any such proposals will be enacted and  if enacted  the particular form such laws would take 
competition 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete for sales in each of our markets with national  regional and local developers and homebuilders  existing home resales and  to a lesser extent  condominiums and rental housing 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our financial results and growth could suffer 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources or lower costs than we do 
competition among both small and large residential homebuilders is based on a number of interrelated factors  including location  reputation  amenities  design  quality and price 
competition is expected to continue and become more intense  and there may be new entrants in the markets in which we currently operate and in markets we may enter in the future 
lack of geographic diversification 
we have operations in texas  arizona and northern california 
failure to be more geographically diversified could adversely impact us if the homebuilding business in our current markets should decline  since there may not be a balancing opportunity in a stronger market in other geographic regions 
additional financing  limitations 
the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities 
at december   our debt totaled approximately million 
we may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including bank financing and securities offerings 
also  lenders are increasingly requiring developers to invest significant amounts of equity in a project both in connection with origination of new loans as well as the extension of existing loans 
the high level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to use for other purposes such as capital expenditures  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations 
if we do not have enough money  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow more money 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives 
operating and financial limitations 
the indenture for our senior notes and credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions will limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our stock  make investments  sell assets  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the indenture for our senior notes requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and our credit facilities require us to maintain other specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 
government regulations  environmental conditions 
regulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and costs and could restrict our business activities 
we are subject to local  state  and federal statutes and rules regulating certain developmental matters  as well as building and site design 
we are subject to various fees and charges of governmental authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
we may be subject to additional costs and delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no growth or slow growth initiatives  building permit ordinances  building moratoriums  or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to health  safety  welfare  or environmental concerns 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from government agencies to engage in certain activities  the granting or receipt of which are beyond our control 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays  may cause substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or geographic areas 
environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber 
recent acquisition 
during we acquired hancock communities and we cannot assure you that the hancock business will be integrated with our existing business  the market and financial synergies we anticipate will be achieved in our expected time frame  or at all  the acquisition will be accretive to earnings due to unexpected expenses  contingencies or liabilities  or due to the financial performance of the hancock business  the combined companies will not lose key employees  management  suppliers or subcontractors  and we can successfully manage new housing lines that were previously managed by hancock or new lines planned for the future 
future expansion 
we may continue to consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand into new or existing markets without a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future expansion will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities  and general economic and business conditions 
new acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations  the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities or expenses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
dependence on key personnel 
our success largely depends on the continuing services of certain key employees  including john landon and steve hilton  and our continued favorable development depends on our ability to attract new personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with certain key officers  and the loss of their services could harm our business 
dependence on subcontractors 
we conduct our construction operations only as a general contractor 
virtually all architectural and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we are dependent upon the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our homes 
there is no assurance that there will be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
in addition  inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse affect on our business 
inflation 
we  like other homebuilders  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  mainly because of higher land and construction costs 
also  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective buyers 
inflation also increases our cost of financing  materials and labor  and could cause our financial results or growth to decline 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers through higher sales prices 
to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  inflation could impact our future operating results 
natural disasters 
we have significant homebuilding operations in texas and northern california 
some of our markets in texas occasionally experience severe weather conditions such as tornadoes or hurricanes 
northern california has been heavily impacted at times by earthquakes  flooding  landslides and other natural disasters 
we do not insure against some of these risks 
these conditions could cause us to incur damage to or losses of our homes under construction or our building lots that exceed our insurance and could cause significant constructions delays or substantial fluctuations in the pricing or availability of building materials 
any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenues  cash flow and earnings 
special note of caution regarding forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the pslra 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  forecast  plan  and project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
such forward looking statements are within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements in this form k include statements concerning the demand for and the pricing of our homes  our ability to deliver existing backlog  the expected outcome of legal proceedings against us  the sufficiency of our capital resources  the impact of new accounting standards  the future realizability of deferred tax assets  the expectation of continued positive operating results in and beyond  the expected benefits of the hancock acquisition  including future home closings and hancock s future contribution to our revenues and earnings  and our ability to continue positive operating results in light of current economic conditions 
such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements  and that could negatively affect our business  and stock and note prices are discussed in this report under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results and financial condition 
forward looking statements express expectations of future events 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to these inherent uncertainties  the investment community is urged not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
in addition  we undertake no obligations to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of anticipated events or changes to projections over time 
as a result of these and other factors  our stock and note prices may fluctuate dramatically 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  although we do have other financial instruments in the form of notes payable and senior debt 
our lines of credit and credit facilities are at variable interest rates and are subject to market risk in the form of interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rate on our senior debt is at a fixed rate 
we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact in the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
for example  based on an average bank borrowings of million during  if the interest rate indices on which our bank borrowing rates are based were to increase basis points in  interest incurred would increase and cash flows would decrease in by  a portion of the increased interest would be expensed as a period cost in  while the balance would be capitalized to real estate under development and be expensed as a cost of home sales in and future years
