item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
upon shipment  the company also provides for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
the company periodically reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items 
such estimates are difficult to make under current economic conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  the company s cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period 
income taxes the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based upon an estimate of pretax financial accounting income for the full year in each of the jurisdictions the company operates  and is impacted by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
stock compensation plans the company has two active stock option plans and one inactive plan 
the two active stock option plans are the stock incentive plan and the directors stock option plan 
the company also has an employee stock purchase plan 
the company has chosen the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and as such  no compensation cost has been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements for the stock option plans or the stock purchase plan 
for footnote disclosure  the valuation of stock issued to employees requires management to determine estimates for the expected life of the options  the expected risk free interest rate during the expected life of the option  the expected volatility of the stock price over the expected life of the option  and the expected dividend yield 
these estimations are significant inputs into the valuation model and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
currently  management expects to continue to follow the disclosure provisions of fas and not record compensation expense related to these stock compensation plans

the company s financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
generally  a weakening us dollar causes the price of the company s product to be more attractive in foreign markets and favorably impacts the company s sales and earnings 
a strengthening us dollar has an unfavorable effect 
this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect the company s foreign sales and earnings 
these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of the company and its competition  whether competition is foreign or us based  changes in technology and local and worldwide economic conditions 
the company utilizes hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into forward and option currency contracts and by borrowing in foreign currencies 
the company s foreign borrowings are used as a hedge of its net investments and for specified transactions 
the company does not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments  and hedging techniques do not increase the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations

factors that may affect future results statements included in the liquidity and capital resources and business initiatives sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements generally include words such as could  expects  may  anticipates  believes  intends  estimates  plans  and similar expressions 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
some of the factors that may affect future results are discussed below 
except as otherwise required by applicable securities laws  we disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the company is subject to global economic and market conditions  including the current conditions affecting the results of the company s customers in the semiconductor  wireless  optoelectronics and other markets in the electronics industry 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company experienced a slowdown in orders  primarily from its semiconductor  wireless and optoelectronics customers 
the company s results have been and could continue to be adversely affected  depending upon business conditions in these industries 
in addition  orders are cancelable by customers and consequently orders outstanding at the end of a reporting period may not result in realized sales in the future 
the company may experience a decline in sales as a result of the current economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
in response to the current economic conditions  the company is managing its cost structure to reallocate resources to areas that it feels will provide the best long term benefit to its customers and shareholders 
a failure by the company to reallocate expenses in a timely manner could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  notwithstanding such measures  a continuing decline in the economy that adversely affects the company s customers would likely adversely affect the company 
the company s business relies on the development of new high technology products and services to provide solutions to customers complex measurement needs 
this requires anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technology trends 
the company must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether its expectations will eventually result in products that achieve market acceptance 
the company incurs significant expenses developing new products that may or may not result in significant sources of revenue and earnings in the future 
in many cases the company s products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers 
if any of the company s competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for the company s product offerings could slow 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of its key executive  sales  development  marketing and operational personnel 
although management believes the company offers competitive salaries and benefits  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel 
failure to retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s products contain large volumes of electronic components and subassemblies that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers 
although the company does not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
additionally  the company s inventory is subject to risks of changes in market demand for particular products 
the resulting excess and or obsolete inventory could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company currently has subsidiaries or sales offices located in approximately countries outside the united states  and non us sales accounted for percent of the company s revenue during fiscal the company s future results could be adversely affected by several factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
for over years  the company has been distributing its products in japan utilizing sales representatives 
beginning on april   the company began utilizing its own sales force 
the company s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to develop an effective sales and support organization in japan 
additionally  the company s earnings could be adversely affected due to higher than anticipated costs to maintain the direct sales offices 
the company began to implement a lean manufacturing initiative in its manufacturing facilities  which are located in cleveland  ohio 
the company s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to meet customer delivery requirements during the implementation period 
additionally  the company expects to benefit from the lean manufacturing with shorter lead times  lower inventory levels and higher inventory turns 
the company s ability to effectively implement lean manufacturing will determine the extent  if any  to which these benefits are realized 
the company pays taxes in several jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company utilizes available tax credits and other tax planning strategies in an effort to minimize the company s overall tax liability 
the company s estimated tax rate for fiscal could change from what is currently anticipated due to changes in tax laws of various countries or changes in the company s overall tax planning strategy 
in october  the company announced that effective january  it would begin to use its own employees  rather than sales representatives  to sell its products in the united states 
the company s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to hire and train an effective sales organization in the united states 
additionally  this move will raise the company s fixed costs 
during times of depressed sales  results will be adversely affected 
through fiscal and  the company will be implementing crm and erp systems 
the company s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement the systems without significant interruptions in accounting systems  order entry  billing  manufacturing and other customer support functions 
the company has several stock based compensation plans for employees and non employee directors 
the company currently adheres to the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and as such  no compensation cost has been recognized in the company s financial statements for the stock option plans and the stock purchase plan 
the company is currently monitoring the recent discussions related to possible new regulations regarding the accounting treatment for stock options 
the company will comply with any changes in the accounting of stock options required by the fasb 
if the fair value based method of accounting for stock options established under sfas no 
were adopted effective october   for the options granted during  the company estimates it would have recognized additional compensation expense of approximately for the year ended september  if the company were to adopt the accounting provision of sfas no 
 the adoption would be prospective 
accordingly  the company would expect stock option expense to increase in the future if additional stock options were issued 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the company currently utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix the company s margins 
generally  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
the company s policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when the company has an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the management s opinion  a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments and therefore the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company also has an interest rate swap instrument originally entered into to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes related to long term debt 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on a notional  of variable rate debt  however  the interest rate swap instrument was determined to be an ineffective hedge and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap are recorded in the company s records as income or expense 
for fiscal year  was charged to expense 
the instrument expires september  in management s opinion  a percent adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on this instrument and therefore the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of us government backed notes and bonds  corporate notes and bonds and mutual funds consisting primarily of government notes and bonds 
an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
however  a percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows
