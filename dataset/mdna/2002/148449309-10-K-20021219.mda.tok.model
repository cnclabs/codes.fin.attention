item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations s omitted except per unit amounts results of operations general from august to september   two of the company s subsidiaries conducted refining operations 
by december   the company s refining subsidiaries had sold all of their refining assets 
as a result  the company accounted for its refining operations as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements as of september  and retroactively 
accordingly  discussion of results of operations has been confined to the results of continuing operations and the anticipated impact  if any  of liquidation of the company s remaining inactive refining subsidiaries and contingent and litigated environmental liabilities of the company and or its inactive refining subsidiaries 
fiscal versus fiscal exploration and production as noted above  the company sold all of its domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  as a result  the following exploration and production financial data for the year ended september  represent only eight months of revenue and expense whereas the data for the year ended september  represent a full twelve months of revenue and expense 
fiscal year ended september  production volumes barrels of crude oil net   mcf thousand cubic feet of natural gas net   mcf equivalents net mcfe   oil gas prices crude oil barrel gross hedging effects net of hedging natural gas mcf gross hedging effects net of hedging oil and gas production expenses mcf equivalent 
barrels of crude oil have been converted to mcf based upon relative energy content of mcf of natural gas per barrel of crude oil 
oil and gas sales decreased approximately  from fiscal to fiscal due to significant decreases in oil and gas prices 
the average price per mcfe decreased from mcfe for the year ended september  to mcfe for the year ended september  the decline in the price received for natural gas was especially precipitous 
for the year ended september   the average price received per mcf of natural gas sold was versus only per mcf for the year ended september  oil and gas sales decreased approximately  as a result of decreases in oil and gas production 
the production decreases were caused primarily by the sale of the company s domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  from the year ended september  to the year ended september  oil production decreased by approximately  barrels and natural gas production decreased by  mcf 
as a result of the  decrease in oil and gas sales due to a decrease in oil and gas prices and the  decrease due to a decrease in oil and gas production  there was a net decrease of  or in oil and gas sales from the year ended september  to the year ended september  oil and gas production expenses decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal a significant portion of the decrease is attributable to the sale of the company s domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may   resulting in only eight months of production expense during the year ended september  versus twelve months of production expenses during the year ended september  for the year ended september   such expenses were 
per equivalent mcf of production versus per equivalent mcf of production for the year ended september  the decrease in production expenses per equivalent mcf is primarily attributable to a higher volume of nonrecurring repairs and maintenance incurred during the year ended september  than were incurred during the year ended september  the higher level of repairs and maintenance expenses incurred during the year ended september  related primarily to the wells acquired from ambrit in june since it appeared ambrit did not repair such wells pending their sale to the company 
furthermore  oil and gas production expenses are typically not incurred ratably throughout any given year but are incurred when and if certain wells require repair and maintenance 
as a result  such comparisons are more appropriate on a multi year basis than on an annual basis 
general and administrative expenses increased or from the year ended september  to the year ended september  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of severance expenses primarily related to employees who were terminated or whose compensation was reduced as a result of the sale of the company s oil and gas properties to delta 
legal fees also increased significantly as a result of the texaco lawsuit see item of this form k 
these increases were partially offset by decreased insurance and compensation expenses and by of non recurring costs incurred during the year ended september  related to a previous effort by the company to sell its oil and gas properties that terminated in december without a sale 
these offsetting factors resulted in the net increase of depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or from fiscal to fiscal this net decrease consists of a decrease of in depreciation of equipment and furniture and fixtures from to and a decrease in depletion of oil and gas properties from  to  for the year ended september   the depletion rate was 
per mcfe versus 
per mcfe for the year ended september  the increase in the depletion rate is indirectly attributable to the significant decreases in oil and gas prices that occurred between the two periods being compared 
the reserve reports used to compute depletion rates are prepared annually as of september  the company s fiscal year end 
as a result of lower oil and gas prices at september  as compared to those at september   the company s economic oil and gas reserves decreased significantly and the resultant cost per mcfe and depletion rate per mcfe increased significantly 
the company did not cause its reserves to be evaluated at september   having sold all of its domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  see note 
interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was caused by a significant decrease in the average balance of invested cash and a decrease in the rate of interest earned on such invested cash 
the following operating items for the year ended september  have no counterpart for the year ended september  gain on sale of domestic oil and gas properties  loss on sale of unproved romanian properties the  gain recorded on the delta sale is analyzed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the loss on the sale of the unproven romanian properties results from the company s sale of its remaining interest in romania 
the company had originally intended to participate in a wildcat well in the black sea but instead sold its interest before drilling commenced 
the company has been informed that such drilling subsequently resulted in a dry hole 
the following other income expense items for the year ended september  are primarily related to the sale of the company s domestic oil and gas properties to delta at may  and have no counterpart during the year ended september  impairment provision marketable securities equity in loss of delta petroleum company before june  equity in loss of delta petroleum company after may  decrease in fair value of option granted to delta petroleum corporation  the impairment provision for marketable securities relates to  shares of delta s common stock acquired by the company in september the provision consists of a impairment provision recorded in the quarter ended march  and a provision recorded effective may  to reduce the book value of the  shares of delta then owned by the company to market value prior to accounting for the company s investment in delta using the equity method of accounting 
the  decrease in the value of the option granted to delta is the result of a decrease in the fair value of the option which  in turn  resulted from a decrease in delta s share price 
the equity in the estimated losses of delta represent the company s share of delta s estimated losses 
the loss prior to may  is applicable only to the  shares of delta owned by the company before may  and approximates of delta s losses for the period from october  to may  the loss after may  applies to all  shares of delta owned by the company after the closing of the delta transaction on may  these shares represent approximately of delta s outstanding shares 
the company s equity in the loss of network increased from for the year ended september  to for the year september  the increase results from increased expenses incurred by network  a start up company that has not yet earned operating revenue 
the company owns of network 
the  tax provision for the year ended september  results primarily because of changes in the company s expectations that it will not generate future taxable income 
the company increased its valuation allowance by  at september   resulting in a deferred tax asset  net of of accrued income taxes on appreciation of marketable securities  of the net deferred tax asset at september  relates to income that has been recognized for tax purposes  but has not yet been recognized for financial reporting purposes 
since november of  the company has reacquired  shares or of its common stock after taking into account a three for one stock split in january 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings and losses per outstanding share have been higher than would be the case if no shares had been repurchased 
fiscal vs fiscal oil and gas sales oil and gas sales increased  or from fiscal to fiscal an analysis of the increase is as follows fiscal year ended september  increase decrease production net barrels of crude oil    mcf of natural gas    equivalent net of natural gas    oil and gas sales before hedging    effect of hedging   net of hedging    average price mcfe before hedging 
effect of hedging net analysis of increase price  mcfe x mcfe  volume  mcfe x mcfe  decrease in hedging losses  rounding for the year ended september   the company s net production averaged barrels of crude per day and  mcfe of natural gas per day versus barrels of crude oil per day and  mcf of natural gas per day for the year ended september  the decline in production volumes is primarily attributable to the depletion of the company s oil and gas reserves and the fact that all but one of the exploratory wells drilled in fiscal and by the company resulted in dry holes rather than production 
the decline in production would have been greater by  mcfe had the company not acquired twenty one producing east texas properties in april see items and above 
oil and gas production expenses increased  or from fiscal to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of twenty one producing properties in east texas in april for the year ended september  oil and gas production expenses  net of non operator reimbursements  were per equivalent mcf sold versus per equivalent mcf sold for the year ended september  the increase results primarily from two factors 
when oil and gas prices increased substantially in the beginning of fiscal  so did operating costs 
such operating costs  however  did not decrease or decreased less than oil and gas prices when oil and gas prices receded sharply later in the fiscal year 
a second factor contributing to the increase is the fact that the average age of the company s producing properties is increasing especially given the unsuccessful results of the company s exploratory drilling programs and the resultant lack of reserves added by new drilling 
mature wells typically carry a higher production expense burden than do newer wells that have not yet been significantly depleted 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to transferring some costs associated with the company s oklahoma city office to corporate  general and administrative costs and decreased consulting costs 
also  see corporate general and administrative expenses below 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization increased on from fiscal to fiscal the components of depreciation  depletion and amortization were as follows year ended september  increase decrease depreciation and amortization of furniture and fixtures and equipment depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties   depreciation and amortization of furniture and fixtures and equipment decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily because certain furniture and fixture assets and vehicles were fully depreciated in fiscal for the year ended september   the depletion rate per equivalent mcf was 
in fiscal versus 
in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from two factors 
first  in april  the company acquired twenty one east texas wells at a higher cost per equivalent mcfe of reserves than that for the company s existing reserves  causing the company s average cost per mcfe of reserves to increase 
second  the depletion rate increased significantly because of significantly lower reserves at september  compared to those at september  reserves decreased primarily because of much lower oil and gas prices at september  compared to september  the lower reserves and higher costs at september  caused the depletion rate to increase 
impairment of unproved properties the impairment reserve for unproved properties increased  from fiscal to fiscal to date  the company has spent  participating in the drilling of five dry holes or uneconomical wells on three concessions in romania and with respect to the planned drilling of a sixth wildcat well in the black sea on a second phase of one concession 
in fiscal  the company recorded an reserve related to one drilling concession 
the  reserve incurred in relates to the other two drilling concessions 
at september   impairment reserves have been provided for all costs incurred in romania except the applicable to the planned sixth well in the black sea see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k concerning the impairment of the company s domestic oil and gas revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses corporate  general and administrative expenses increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to legal costs related to the long trusts litigation and the texaco claim and related to the company s effort to sell its oil and gas properties earlier in the fiscal year 
other income expense interest income decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average balance of cash invested during the periods being compared and to a decrease in the interest rate received by the company on invested funds 
the composition of other income expense for the years ended september  and is as follows year ended september  litigation recovery costs miscellaneous provision for income taxes the tax provisions benefit for the years ended september  and consist of the following components year ended september  decrease in net deferred tax asset using federal and state blended tax rate change in valuation allowance  other primarily revisions of previous estimates the tax provision for the year ended september  consists primarily of deferred taxes of related to timing differences originating in fiscal and a decrease of in the valuation allowance from fiscal the decrease in the valuation allowance resulted because the company determined that a portion of the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized based upon estimates of future taxable income and upon the projected taxable income resulting from the anticipated sale of its oil and gas assets to delta and  accordingly  decreased the valuation allowance by to  the tax provision for the year ended september  consists primarily of deferred taxes of related to timing differences originating in fiscal and the reversal of a  valuation reserve from fiscal the reversal of the valuation reserve resulted because of positive evidence that the company would be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize its deferred tax asset 
such positive evidence consists primarily of the increased value of the company s oil and gas reserves as a result of substantially higher oil and gas prices 
since november  the company has repurchased  or of its common shares 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings per share are significantly higher than they would be if no shares had been repurchased 
earnings per share basic earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per common share are based upon maximum possible dilution calculated using average stock prices during the year 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended september   the company used  from operating activities 
during the same period the company invested in oil and gas properties and in network 
at september   the company had  of unrestricted cash   of working capital  no long term debt and no operating assets or operating revenues  having sold all of its domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  in december  the company loaned an additional to network 
at the present time the two most likely future courses of action for the company are liquidation and continuing to operate 
as noted in previous public filings  the most likely course of action is liquidation given the company s lack of operating assets and the ever increasing regulatory  legal  accounting and administrative costs of being a public company 
the company s board of directors has not  however  formally adopted a plan of liquidation given the recent lawsuit filed by chevrontexaco 
see item to this form k 
the company s general counsel  management and special counsel believe chevrontexaco s claims are without merit and that chevrontexaco is using the legal system to disrupt the company s business activities and to coerce the company to pay chevrontexaco a settlement in order to allow the company to liquidate 
the company expects that it will incur significant legal costs to defend itself against chevrontexaco s lawsuit 
the company s management and board of directors are continuously monitoring the legal situation 
since the company s board of directors has discussed but not yet formally adopted a plan of liquidation  the future impacts of both liquidation and continuing operations are discussed below 
liquidation if a decision is made to liquidate  the company anticipates that it would distribute some cash and delta shares to its stockholders in complete liquidation of their stock as soon as possible while retaining sufficient assets to reasonably provide for existing and anticipated future liabilities  including those related to the contingent and litigated environmental claims and other current litigation 
such provision would include the company s  certificate of deposit provided for the letter of credit supporting its supersedeas bond as required for the company s appeal of the long trust litigation plus interest see item to this form k and sufficient assets to provide a reasonable reserve for the company s other outstanding litigation liabilities  if any  including any outstanding contingent environmental litigation and other liabilities 
if any net assets remain after the company pays or provides for such remaining liabilities  the net proceeds of such assets would then be distributed to stockholders as a final distribution 
the company would probably also file a no action letter with the securities and exchange commission sec seeking relief from continuing sec reporting requirements 
such a plan of liquidation or any other plan of liquidation would be subject to prior approval by the company s stockholders 
the primary risks associated with such a liquidation scenario are as follows a 
litigation as noted above  the company is a defendant in three significant unsettled lawsuits 
although the company does not believe it has any material liabilities with respect to any of these lawsuits  any or several of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits could undertake legal actions to prevent the company from making liquidating distributions to its stockholders 
any resulting litigation could not only cause the company to incur significant legal costs but could also delay any distributions to stockholders for years and or reduce or eliminate entirely such distributions 
if chevrontexaco were to prevail on its indemnity claim in its lawsuit see item of this form k  chevrontexaco s recovery could conceivably exceed the company s net worth and prevent liquidating distributions to stockholders 
chevrontexaco could also conceivably sue larger stockholders of the company after a distribution had been made 
in addition  even if the company s stockholders approve any future plan of liquidation  dissident stockholders of the company could conceivably also take legal actions to prevent the company from implementing any liquidation plan 
b 
tax risks as a result of the delta transaction  the company received  shares of delta s common stock in addition to the  shares of delta common stock it previously owned 
if delta s stock price increases before any distribution to stockholders  the company could be subject to federal and state income tax at the corporate level on the interim appreciation of delta s stock if the company s remaining tax carryforwards are not sufficient to offset income taxes on such appreciation 
under such circumstance the tax treatment is the same as if the company had sold its delta shares for their fair market value and then distributed the proceeds to its stockholders 
such could be the case if there are delays in making distributions to stockholders and delta s stock price increases in the interim 
any resulting gain would essentially constitute phantom income to the company since the company would realize a taxable gain without receiving any related proceeds 
c 
continuing public company administrative burden if the company s directors decide to liquidate  the company will probably seek relief from most of its public company reporting requirements 
if such a request is denied by the sec  the company would continue incurring the costs of being a public company while having no operating revenues to absorb such costs 
such costs are significant and probably will increase in the future given the myriad of post enron regulatory requirements that are currently being mandated 
the result would be a diminution of assets available for distribution to stockholders 
d 
lack of liquidity if the company s directors decide to liquidate and the related plan of liquidation is approved by the company s stockholders  it is likely that the company s stock would cease to trade after the plan of liquidation is filed 
in such a case  stockholders would not be able to trade their stock 
stockholders who have used their company stock as collateral for margin loans would probably be required to provide other collateral to support such loans 
even if the company is able to distribute delta stock as part of its initial distribution to stockholders without any legal challenges or other delays  there could be a delay between the date the company s stock is delisted and the date when the company s stockholders receive delta shares that could be substituted as collateral for a margin loan 
stockholders would presumably have to provide other collateral in the interim 
e 
liquidation of assets the company s primary remaining assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and the company s investments in penn octane corporation  shares and delta  shares 
although all of the company s shares of delta have recently been registered and most of the company s shares of penn octane are already registered  both penn octane and delta are small  thinly capitalized companies with small trading volumes and the company may not be able to sell its penn octane stock and or its delta stock for their listed market prices if the company needs cash to distribute to its stockholders or to liquidate liabilities 
in addition  the company owns of network 
network is a private limited liability company with no public market for its membership units 
as a result  the company expects that it would be difficult at the present time to sell its interest in network if liquidation is required 
continuing to operate if the company does not liquidate but instead continues to operate  the company would still be subject to several of the risks noted above  including litigation risk  the continuing public company administrative burden  the lack of liquidity and liquidation of asset risk if the company decides to liquidate its remaining assets 
the company estimates that its annual general and administrative costs  if it continues to exist as a public company  would be  excluding litigation related legal costs 
in addition  the company would lack operating assets  operating personnel since most of its personnel have already been severed and a business to operate 
under such circumstances  the company would be subject to many competitive disadvantages if it again decides to acquire energy assets or other assets and businesses 
for example  few analysts believe it is possible to acquire oil and gas properties at favorable prices at the present time or in the near future given current high prices for oil and gas production and reserves 
many energy companies have more financial resources than the company and could easily outbid the company in such an acquisition scenario 
furthermore  failure by the company to be engaged primarily in a business other than that of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities within one year following closing of the sale to delta could subject the company to federal regulation under the investment company act of  and this would result in even more significant regulatory compliance costs and obligations 
in addition  if the company continues to operate  it would continue to be subject to the following risk factors a 
contingent and litigated environmental liabilities see item to this form k 
b 
public market for company s stock the small trading volumes in the company s stock may create liquidation problems for large investors in the company 
c 
other risks including general business risks  insurance claims against the company in excess of insurance coverage  tax liabilities resulting from tax audits and litigation risk 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company currently owns no oil or gas reserves and is thus no longer directly subject to market risks with respect to oil and gas prices 
at september  and december   the company owned  shares of delta and  shares of penn octane 
both delta and penn octane are thinly traded public companies with small market capitalizations 
the stock price of each company has fluctuated significantly in the last three years and thus the company s investments in delta and penn octane remain subject to significant changes in the market prices of these stocks and limited liquidity 
inflation and changing prices the company currently has no active business and thus does not expect inflation and changing prices to affect its future results of operations in a material manner

 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no

 liability recognition for certain employee termination activity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  critical accounting policies the accounting policies critical to the company in the future  are as follows equity method of accounting the company currently owns approximately of delta and accounts for its investment in delta using the equity method of accounting 
under this method  the company is required to increase its investment in delta by its share of delta s income and decrease such investment by its share of delta s losses and any distributions from delta 
if delta incurs future losses  the company would thus include its share of such losses in its consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the company estimates that its investment in delta exceeded the company s proportional share of delta s equity by approximately  at closing 
the company has allocated such excess to delta s ownership interests in offshore california leases and the related potential recovery from a lawsuit delta and other owners of offshore california leases have instituted against the united states for breach of contract 
the company will be required to evaluate the recoverability of the leases periodically and write them off or reduce them to the extent it is not deemed recoverable 
in addition  if delta incurs recurring losses in the future and or the market value of its stock declines significantly  the company s investment in delta may be impaired and the company may then be required to recognize the impairment 
discontinued refining operations at september   the company had recorded net refining liabilities retained of  and an estimated value of discontinued net refining assets of resulting in a recorded net liability of  as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k 
chevrontexaco has sued the company for environmental remediation costs that have been estimated at  the company s accounting policy with respect to contingent environmental liabilities is to record environmental liabilities when and if environmental assessment and or remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
although the company and its special counsel believe that chevrontexaco s claims are utterly without merit  the company would be required to record additional environmental liabilities if it becomes probable that the company will incur liabilities related to chevrontexaco s claims or other environmental liabilities and such liabilities exceed  as noted above  if such liabilities exceed the value of the company s assets  the company would not have the financial capability to pay such liabilities 
the company has classified the estimated realizable value of discontinued net refining assets and net refining liabilities retained as non current because it appears that these items will not be realized in the next year given the recent lawsuit filed against the company by chevrontexaco see item to this form k 
the amounts and classification of the estimated values of discontinued net refining assets and net refining liabilities retained could change significantly in the future as a result of litigation or other factors 
future distributions to stockholders  if any if the company s board of directors decides to liquidate the company  it is probable that the related plan of liquidation would contemplate distributions to stockholders of shares of delta common stock and perhaps of other assets of the company 
if the company distributes delta stock or other assets to stockholders  the company will first adjust the book value of the assets to be distributed to their fair market values  if appropriate  for an indicated impairment of value  recognizing the resultant loss 
the company would then record the distribution as a charge to retained earnings equal to the book value of the assets being distributed 
changes in the value allocated to the delta s repurchase option as part of the delta sale  the company granted delta an option to repurchase up to  of its shares for share until may  at closing on may   the company valued that option at  using the black scholes method 
the company will be required to account for changes in the value of this option by recording gains or losses  as applicable  in its statement of operations 
at september   the value of option had been reduced to and the company had recorded a  gain 
if the option expires by its own terms or is only partially exercised at expiration  the company would then record a gain equal to the remaining book value of the unexercised options 
if delta exercises the option the company would record a gain per share exercised equal to the difference between and the book value per share at the time of exercise 
valuation allowance for deferred income tax asset at september   the company recorded a valuation allowance of  offsetting its gross deferred tax asset of  at that date 
that valuation allowance is based upon the company s assessment that the company will not generate future taxable income to utilize all of its gross deferred tax assets at september  based on the company s expectations that it will incur significant general and administrative expenses liquidating its assets without earning offsetting revenue 
in addition  the company is a party to several lawsuits including a complaint for environmental indemnification for which the company has recorded no liability 
the net deferred tax asset at september  relates to income that has been recognized for tax purposes but has not yet been recognized for financial reporting purposes 
if circumstances change such that the company expects future taxable income  the company will revise its valuation allowance  resulting in tax recoveries 
recent sales of unregistered securities not applicable
