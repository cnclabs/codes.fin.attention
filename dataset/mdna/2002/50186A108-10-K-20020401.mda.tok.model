lynch systems objectives ls intends to continue to build on its name recognition and reputation as one of the world s leading manufacturers of glass forming machinery 
ls is the only independent supplier in the crt cathode ray tube glass forming field and it is ls s intention to use this strength to form closer partnerships with its customers in their pursuit of innovative glass making machinery 
ls s long term intentions are to monitor the market direction and to be at the forefront of technology in order to respond to market demand for new and innovative types of machinery needed to produce glass 
ls intends to continue to research and develop state of the art machinery within its core competence  and also to seek new markets where its experience and proven success can be utilized to develop new products and increase its growth 
ls also intends to continue to expand on its new expertise obtained from lynch amav in the feeder and shear markets discussed below and to reduce the cost of its raw materials by continuing to search for cheaper suppliers of materials  especially from foreign markets 
in addition  ls intends to continue its own in house cost cutting programs by eliminating redundant or superfluous operations  improving its factory quality and yield rates and better utilization of its current personnel 
by increasing its efficiency and shortening its delivery rate  ls hopes to increase the number of turns giving a positive effect to its financial performance 
there is no assurance that ls can attain these objectives 
products and manufacturing ls manufactures glass forming presses and electronic controls to provide high speed automated systems to form different sizes of face panels and crt display tubes for television screens and computer monitors including presses to build large screen televisions for the hdtv high definition television market 
ls also manufactures and installs forming equipment that sizes  cuts  and forms tableware such as glass tumblers  plates  cups  saucers and commercial optical glass 
additionally  ls manufactures and installs fire polishing  electronic controls and retrofit systems for crt display and consumer glass presses 
at year end  ls  through a subsidiary  entered into a joint venture  lynch amav llc  with amav gmbh of germany to develop and manufacture glass manufacturing equipment for the tableware industry 
ls has a interest in the joint venture 
the joint venture designs and develops feeders  shears and presses  most of which are manufactured for the joint venture by ls 
ls believes that this joint venture has expanded ls s glass tableware equipment business  particularly in europe 
the production of glassware entails the use of machines  which heat glass and  using great pressure  form an item by pressing it into a desired shape 
because of the high cost of bringing the machine and materials up to temperature  a machine for producing glassware must be capable of running hours a day  days a year 
during  ls  including lynch amav  built tv television and consumer glass press machines for customers  as well as selling feeders  shears and spare parts 
ls delivered four large tv glass press machines in these four large machines had a selling price of approximately million  all of which was recognized as income in in ls sold four additional large tv glass press machines to be delivered in these additional machines sold for approximately million  of which million was recognized as income in using the percentage of completion method and the balance of million will be recognized in at december   ls had orders for million for large tv glass press machines as well as for glass press machines  feeders  shears and spare parts for the tableware market  all of which are scheduled to be 
table of contents delivered in ls is also in negotiations to obtain other orders for large tv glass presses  however  there can be no assurance that ls will obtain any other orders 
ls s worldwide customers require capital equipment that produces a wide variety of tableware products to remain competitive 
in support of this market demand  lynch systems has invested in r d programs to manufacture new lines of capital equipment such as stretch machines for one piece stemware  firepolishers for high quality tableware and spinning machines for high speed  high quality dishware 
to further expand ls s tableware product lines  additional product lines have been acquired through royalty partnerships with leading industry concerns 
in  ls acquired the h press and blow machine from emhart 
this high production machine produces both round and geometric design tumblers and is now marketed by ls as the lh with numerous electronic control improvements 
in  the eldred product line of burnoff machines  used to fire finish the rims of the h tumblers  and four color decorating machines were acquired by ls 
all tableware capital equipment requires moulds in the production of any article 
in  agreement was reached with merkad  a producer of high quality moulds  to represent and distribute moulds throughout north and south america 
ls has the capabilities to take a glass product idea from a customer  have our engineering staff design a machine that will mass produce this glass product and then build the final machine for the customer 
international sales ls s revenues from international sales were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of ls s net sales for  and  respectively 
the profitability of international sales is approximately equivalent to that of domestic sales 
because many international orders require partial advance deposits  with the balance often secured by irrevocable letters of credit from banks in the foreign country  the registrant believes that some of the credit risks commonly associated with doing business in international markets are minimized 
the registrant avoids currency exchange risk by transacting substantially all international sales in united states dollars 
backlog ls had an order backlog of approximately million at december   compared with approximately million at december  all of ls s million backlog as of december  is scheduled to be delivered in ls includes as backlog only those orders which are subject to written contract or written purchase orders 
in  ls received million in connection with the cancellation of a million dollar order for large tv glass presses and parts  which amount can be used by the customer as a credit for future orders 
the million has been reduced to million as of december  as a result of sales to this customer 
competition ls believes that in the worldwide pressware market it is the largest supplier to glass companies that do not manufacture their own pressware machines 
competitors include various companies in italy  japan  korea  germany and elsewhere 
while several of the largest domestic and international producers of glass pressware frequently build their own glass forming machines and produce spare parts in house  nearly all pressware producers have made purchases of machines and or spare parts from ls 
customers ls s business is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers 
raw materials raw materials are generally available to ls in adequate supply from a number of suppliers 

table of contents research and development research and development expense was  in and zero in each of and r d expense for is budgeted at  intellectual property lynch systems owns patents and proprietary know how which are important to its business and the maintenance of its competitive position 
its most important patent is for a rotary glass molding press with cushioned trunnion mounted hydraulic drive  expiring october  lynch system s investment in lynch amav  discussed above  has given lynch systems access to important proprietary know how and technology which has enabled lynch systems to expand its product offerings and customer base

m tron industries  inc m tron overview m tron  a wholly owned subsidiary of lynch  is a designer  manufacturer and marketer of custom designed electronic components that are used primarily to control the frequency or timing of electronic signals in communications equipment 
its devices  which are commonly called frequency control devices  crystals or oscillators  support fixed and mobile wireless  copper wire  coaxial cable  wide area networks  local area networks and fiber optic systems 
it sells its products to original equipment manufacturers  contract manufacturers and to distributors 
m tron s products are quartz crystal based frequency control devices consisting of packaged quartz crystals and oscillators incorporating those crystals 
its products enable communications equipment manufacturers and network equipment manufacturers to meet the increasing demands of their customers because they produce an electrical signal that is accurate the frequency of the signal does not change significantly over a period of time  stable the frequency of the signal does not vary significantly when our product is subjected to a range of operating temperatures  and has low electronic noise the signal does not add interfering signals that can degrade the performance of the electronics system 
in addition  m tron sells crystals and oscillators which are used outside the communications industry 
these frequency control devices are used in microprocessor and computer applications  industrial controls  medical instrumentation  automotive products and military applications 
m tron has over years of experience designing  manufacturing and marketing crystal based frequency control products 
its customers rely on the skills of m tron s engineering and design team to help them solve frequency control problems during all phases of their product s life cycles  including product design  prototyping  manufacturing and subsequent product improvements 
selected financial information for financial reporting purposes  m tron comprises the registrant s frequency control devices segment 
for information about this segment s net sales  profit or loss  and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years  please see note segment information to the registrant s consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents m tron objectives m tron s objective is to build on the strength of its core expertise in packaged quartz crystal and oscillator technologies to become the supplier of choice to original equipment manufacturers who supply infrastructure equipment to the communications and networking industries 
m tron intends to maintain its current investment in technical resources  including design and engineering personnel to enable it to provide a high level of design and engineering support to its customers 
it believes that technical participation with its original equipment manufacturers customers in the early stages of their design process will lead to m tron s frequency control devices being designed into their products more regularly 
m tron intends to increase the use of its offshore contract manufacturers who have added capacity on its behalf 
however  during the current economic slowdown  this additional capacity is not being fully utilized 
in addition  m tron s long term objective is to reduce the time it takes to manufacture its products which will result in further increases in its manufacturing capacity 
to that end  it has dedicated additional resources to evaluating its manufacturing processes and to identifying and implementing process improvements 
m tron believes that it can significantly enhance its business opportunities by acquiring technology  product portfolios and or customer bases 
some of these may offer immediate sales opportunities while others may meet longer term objectives 
it plans to pursue these opportunities by making strategic acquisitions or by acquiring or licensing technology 
m tron intends to design  manufacture and sell devices that offer higher frequencies or greater precision than its current products 
these devices will serve applications within the communications and networking industries for which it does not currently provide products 
it intends to achieve this through a combination of focused research and development and strategic acquisitions  if they are appropriate 
there is no assurance that m tron can achieve these objectives 
products m tron s products are high quality  reliable  technically advanced frequency control devices  including packaged quartz crystals and oscillators incorporating those crystals 
m tron designs and produces a range of packaged quartz crystals and quartz crystal based oscillators 
there are a variety of features in its product family 
the packaged crystal is a single crystal in a hermetically sealed package and is used by electronic equipment manufacturers  along with their own electronic circuitry  to build oscillators for frequency control in their electronic devices 
the clock oscillator is the simplest of its oscillators 
it is a self contained package with a crystal and electronic circuitry that is used as a subsystem by electronic equipment manufacturers to provide frequency control for their devices 
the voltage controlled crystal oscillator vcxo is a variable frequency oscillator whose frequency can be changed by varying the control voltage to the oscillator 
the temperature compensated crystal oscillator tcxo is an oscillator designed for use over a range of temperatures 
the digitally compensated crystal oscillator dcxo is a temperature compensated oscillator in which the compensation electronics are digital and offer greater frequency stability than the tcxo over a range of temperatures 
this variety of features in m tron s product family offers the designers at electronic equipment manufacturers a range of options as they create the needed performance in their products 
currently  m tron s oscillator products operate at frequencies ranging from kilohertz to over megahertz which constitute most of the oscillator frequencies that are now used in communications equipment 
however  many of its products  through amplification or other means  are ultimately incorporated into those products that operate at frequencies in excess of megahertz 
m tron s products are employed in numerous applications within the communications industry  including computer and telephone network switches  high speed gigabit ethernet  modems  wireless transmitters receivers  multiplexers  data recovery regeneration devices  fiber channel networks  repeaters  data 
table of contents transceivers  line interface devices and base station controllers 
its products are incorporated into end products that serve all elements of the communications industry 
the crystals and oscillators m tron sells for use in non communications applications are used in industrial applications such as security systems  metering systems  electronic test instruments and industrial control systems 
they are used in military and medical instrumentation applications as well as in various computer peripheral equipment such as printers  modems  monitors  video cards and sound cards 
these non communications applications may not require the quality and reliability demanded by manufacturers of communications equipment 
research and development at december   m tron employed engineers and technicians in south dakota who devoted most of their time to research and development 
m tron intends to maintain the number of engineers and technicians who perform research and development in its research and development expense was approximately  in   in and  in at its current level of resources  which is reduced from the level of  m tron expects to reduce its spending on research and development by during customers m tron markets and sells its frequency control devices primarily to original equipment manufacturers of communications and networking equipment  contract manufacturers for original equipment manufacturers  and distributors who sell to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers

sales to its ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales for  and international sales m tron s revenues from international sales were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of its net sales for  and  respectively 
in  this consisted of approximately from customers in canada  from customers in asia  from customers in western europe and from customers in mexico 
m tron is increasing its international sales efforts by adding distributors and manufacturers representatives in western europe and asia 
backlog m tron had backlog orders of approximately million at december  compared with approximately million at december  however  monthly new orders for the first two months of were higher than the average monthly orders for the last three months of m tron includes as backlog those orders which are subject to specific production release orders under written contracts  verbal and written orders from distributors with which it has had long standing relationships  as well as written purchase orders from sales representatives 
its customers may cancel or defer orders without significant penalty 
competition frequency control devices are sold in a highly competitive industry 
there are numerous domestic and international manufacturers who are capable of providing custom designed quartz crystals and oscillator modules comparable in quality and performance to its products 
competitors include vectron international a division of dover corporation  cts corporation and saronix 
m tron does not operate in the same markets as high volume manufacturers of standard products  rather it focuses on manufacturing lower volumes of 
table of contents custom designed frequency control devices 
many of its competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than it does 
m tron seeks to manufacture custom designed  high performance crystals and oscillators  which it believes it can sell competitively based upon performance  quality  order response time and a high level of engineering support 
manufacturing m tron has one manufacturing facility in yankton  south dakota  and has long term relationships with two contract manufacturers in asia 
m tron maintains a rigorous quality control system and is an iso qualified manufacturer 
in  m tron established a working relationship with a contract manufacturer located in south korea  and in  it established a working relationship with a contract manufacturer located in the people s republic of china 
while it does not have written long term agreements with them  it believes that it is the largest customer for each of these contract suppliers and  as such  believes that from time to time it received preferential treatment on production scheduling matters 
m tron attempts to utilize standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors located in the united states or internationally  however  some components used in its products are available from only a limited number of sources 
intellectual property m tron has no patents  trademarks or licenses which are considered to be important to m tron s business or operations 
rather  m tron believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineering and technical staff in areas of product design and manufacturing processes as well as proprietary know how and information 
employees as of december   m tron employed people 
it has also employed independent contractors and temporary employees 
none of its employees is represented by a labor union and it considers its employee relations to be good

adhesive backed label stock spinnaker coating develops  manufactures and markets pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock that is converted by printers and industrial users into products that are utilized for marking  identifying  labeling and decorating applications and products 
to better concentrate on spinnaker coating s strengths and market niche  a decision was made by spinnaker s management to reorganize and realign the business in the fourth quarter of and going forward in the restructuring involved the elimination of non pressure sensitive product lines  outsourcing of non core manufacturing processes and termination of approximately employees 
pressure sensitive products  which are activated by the application of pressure  are manufactured with a three element construction consisting of face stock  adhesive coating and silicone coated release liner 
the adhesive product is sold in roll or sheet form for further conversion into products used primarily for marking  identification and promotional labeling 
spinnaker coating s pressure sensitive products are sold under the trade names strip tac and strip tac plus 
roll pressure sensitive products are generally sold to label printers that produce products used primarily for informational labels shipping labels  price labels  warning labels  etc  product identification and postage stamps 
sheet pressure sensitive products are sold to commercial sheet printers  who provide information labels and other products such as laser printer stock 
marketing and customers spinnaker coating markets its broad range of products to a variety of customers 
its marketing strategy focuses not only on products but also customer service and specific customer applications 
spinnaker has conducted business with its top customers for approximately years on average 
during  one customer  paper corporation of the united states  accounted for approximately of spinnaker s net sales 
spinnaker coating generally markets its products through its own sales representatives to regional and national printers  converters and merchants 
a major portion of sales represent product manufactured and shipped to customers directly from spinnaker coating s facilities in troy  ohio 
however  to broaden its market penetration  spinnaker coating also contracts with regional processors throughout the united states  with whom spinnaker coating stores product until sold 
generally  these processors perform both slitting and distribution services for spinnaker coating 
manufacturing and raw materials spinnaker coating manufactures its adhesive backed label stock products at two plants in troy  ohio 
spinnaker has made approximately million in capital expenditures at the ohio facilities over the last five years 

table of contents raw materials are the most significant cost component in spinnaker coating s production process 
the material component accounts for approximately of the total cost of its products  with the most important raw materials being paper gumming kraft and face stock  adhesive materials  and polypropylene film 
these materials are currently readily available and are procured from numerous suppliers 
the cost of spinnaker s principal raw materials have generally remained stable or decreased over recent years 
historically  the increases in raw material costs for spinnaker s products have not materially impacted spinnaker s gross margin 
the future impact of a change in raw material costs on spinnaker s profitability is based  in part  on pricing by spinnaker s competitors 
although  changes in spinnaker s raw material costs have recently not materially impacted spinnaker s gross margin  spinnaker cannot be assured that future raw material cost increases can be passed through to its customers or that such cost increases will not negatively impact spinnaker s gross margin 
competition the adhesive backed label stock industry is highly competitive 
spinnaker coating competes with several national manufacturers  including the fasson unit of avery dennison and the mactac unit of bemis company  inc  as well as a number of importers and smaller regional manufacturers 
as a result of the competitive environment in the markets in which spinnaker coating operates  the company faces and will continue to face pricing pressure on its products 
as a result of such pricing pressure  spinnaker coating has experienced  and may continue to experience  reductions in the profit margins on its sales  or has and may be unable to pass future raw material price increases to its customers which would also reduce profit margins 
backlog spinnaker coating s label stock backlog believed to be firm was million at december   as compared to million at december  industrial process equipment business through entoleter  spinnaker engineers  manufactures and markets a line of industrial process equipment and a line of air pollution control equipment 
entoleter s net sales consist entirely of sales to commercial and industrial customers 
environmental regulations spinnaker s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air  discharges to waterways  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
spinnaker is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict the effect that these laws and regulations will have on spinnaker in the future 
while spinnaker believes it is currently in substantial compliance with all such environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that it will at all times be in complete compliance with all such requirements 
spinnaker has made  and expects to continue to make  capital expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
as is the case with manufacturers in general  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from spinnaker s properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of spinnaker s properties  spinnaker may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material 
patents and trademarks patents are held by spinnaker with respect to the manufacture of certain of its products  but its management does not consider such patents to be important to spinnaker s operations 
the patents expire over various lengths of time with the last patent expiring in about years 
spinnaker has registered several of its trade names and trademarks for adhesive backed materials 

table of contents international sales spinnaker s international sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately   and of spinnaker s net sales for  and  respectively 
of the million in international sales  approximately were represented by exports of spinnaker coating 
the substantial majority of these sales were to canadian customers and  consequently  spinnaker believes that the risks commonly associated with doing business in international countries are minimal 
the gross margin on international sales is substantially equivalent to that of domestic sales 
because international sales are transacted in united states dollars  payments in many cases are secured by irrevocable letters of credit 
employees as of december   spinnaker employed persons  of whom were spinnaker coating employees and were entoleter employees 
spinnaker coating s troy  ohio plants began negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers international union  afl cio pace in february  but have yet to reach an agreement 
this agreement will cover approximately hourly employees 
entoleter s approximately hourly production employees are members of the united electrical  radio and machine workers of america union 
the current collective bargaining agreement expires in spinnaker and entoleter believe that their relations with their employees are good  however  there can be no assurance that they will not experience work stoppages or slowdowns in the future

amex requested lynch to provide the exchange with lynch s specific plan for achieving compliance with the exchange s continued listing guidelines 
on january   lynch responded to the exchange  explaining that lynch s failure to meet the continued listing guidelines was attributable to the fact that  until september   by virtue of its control position in spinnaker  lynch was required to consolidate of spinnaker s losses and that  in the absence of these losses from spinnaker  lynch would have reported positive equity and positive net income for the month period ending september  lynch further explained that its new management team had taken steps to deconsolidate spinnaker from lynch for financial reporting purposes effective from and after september  by reducing lynch s equity and voting interests in spinnaker below

spinnaker deconsolidation 
lynch explained that the deconsolidation of spinnaker resulted in a non cash gain of million being recorded on september  and also resulted in lynch retaining a negative investment in spinnaker of million  representing lynch s remaining interest in spinnaker s accumulated deficit as of september   that this remaining interest represents losses in excess of investment  which has been recorded as a deferred gain on lynch s balance sheet until such time as spinnaker achieves profitability or lynch disposes of its remaining interest in spinnaker see note to the registrant s consolidated financial statements included in this report  that lynch will not record any additional losses from spinnaker  that  in lynch s view  the million deferred gain should be treated as equity by amex for purposes of assessing lynch s compliance with the listing standards  and that  after giving effect to the deconsolidation of spinnaker  lynch retains a strong balance sheet 
finally  lynch explained that management expects lynch s business will be profitable and that the current negative equity position of lynch  even before consideration of the aforementioned deferred gain as additional equity  would be reduced annually and turn positive in fiscal 
table of contents on january   the exchange notified lynch that it had determined to continue lynch s listing pending a review of its march  form q

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  percentage of completion of long term contracts  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company estimates potential losses based on its knowledge 
table of contents of the financial condition of certain customers 
historically  losses have been within the company s expectations 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  adjustments may be required 
accounting for long term contracts one of the company s subsidiaries is engaged in the manufacture of machines and accounts for the related long term contracts using the percentage of completion accounting method as costs are incurred 
estimates are used to determine the completion percentages and projected profitability of these contracts based on available information 
actual progress made on these contracts may result in future changes to these estimates 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment may be required to the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
recently issued accounting standards the company has described the impact anticipated from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements effective in in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
results of operations year compared to including results of spinnaker for the nine months ended september  effective september   the company s ownership and voting interest of spinnaker industries  inc was reduced to and respectively  due to the disposition of shares of spinnaker 
as a result  effective september   the company relinquished control of spinnaker and has deconsolidated spinnaker and will prospectively account for its ownership of spinnaker using the equity method of accounting 
see note basis of presentation included elsewhere herein 
accordingly  spinnaker results of operations have only been included for nine months in net sales revenues for the year ended december  were million  a reduction of million from fiscal year spinnaker s net sales for the nine month period ending september  were million  compared to million for the full year in the decrease in spinnaker net sales for was mainly attributable to lower selling prices due to excess capacity and depressed demand caused by the weakened general economy as well as the deconsolidation at september  another contributing factor was the shutdown of spinnaker s facility in maine in the first quarter of lynch systems revenues increased by percent to million due to increased order flow and sales of glass press machines used mainly by the producers of television and computer monitor screens and other devices that incorporate electronic display 
m tron s served market  the infrastructure segment of the telecommunications industry  was deeply depressed by the major correction of overcapacity caused by the 
table of contents internet bubble 
m tron could not overcome the dramatic reduction in spending by its customers and suffered a sales decline from million in to million in operating loss operating loss for was million compared to an operating loss of million in spinnaker s nine month operating loss was million compared to an operating loss of million in spinnaker s operating results primarily reflect lower operating margins due to lower selling prices attributable to excess capacity and a weak general economy 
spinnaker recognized restructuring charges affiliated with its coating business  during the first nine months of of million compared to million in the restructuring charge was for the closing of the spinnaker coating facility in westbrook  maine 
non cash asset impairment charges of million goodwill million  fixed assets million accounted for the majority of the million restructuring cost

subsequent to the company s deconsolidation of spinnaker  spinnaker filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in november  as of march   an agreement to sell the majority of the spinnaker business had been approved by the bankruptcy court 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for further details 
m tron s operating profit declined by million from a profit of million to a loss of million 
in spite of a percent reduction in headcount and a further curtailment in hours worked  m tron could not compensate for the percent reduction in sales and lower selling prices 
m tron s and profits were also impacted by ipo rights offering costs of  and  respectively 
m tron s earnings were also reduced by a product issue with a long time contract manufacturer 
m tron provided reserves for this product issue totaling  at december  in addition  m tron wrote down its inventories by  due to the sudden drop in demand that started in march  lynch systems operating profit increased by million to million due to increased order volume and cost controls that enabled lynch systems to improve its return on sales by percentage points 
other income expense investment income decreased by million all attributable to spinnaker caused by lower investment earnings rates  the month versus month comparison  and less cash invested 
interest expense of million was million less than the prior year primarily due to reduced debt at lynch systems  the month versus month comparison at spinnaker  and lower borrowing rates 
income tax benefit expense includes federal  state and local taxes 
in spite of a net loss for the year  there was a  tax expense as spinnaker s loss does not provide any tax benefits to lynch 
factors resulting in this tax  and factors that reduced the year effective tax rate to include provisions for contingencies  state income taxes  goodwill amortization  a valuation allowance for deferred taxes  and our foreign sales corporation 
minority interests  reduced losses by million as a result of losses at spinnaker that were allocable to the minority interests to the extent of their investment in spinnaker  and profits of million for the minority interest in lynch amav 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  which compares to the net loss of million  or per share  for the same period of  and was due primarily to spinnaker s month loss of million that was partly offset by the million gain on deconsolidation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
total backlog of manufactured products at december  excluding spinnaker was million  which represents a decrease of million from the comparable backlog of million at december  not included in this backlog is million and million at december  and respectively  representing a payment from a customer for a glass press order at lynch systems which was subsequently cancelled 
the customer can use this amount for future orders and  if not utilized  will be 
table of contents forfeited to lynch systems 
the backlog at lynch systems declined slightly from million to million 
meanwhile  the backlog at m tron decreased to million from million due to the dramatic reduction in buying by oem suppliers to the telecommunications sector which started in march  year compared to net sales revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million from the comparable period 
spinnaker s net sales were million  compared to million in the decrease in net sales for is attributed to entering into a joint venture to outsource the manufacturing and sales of non pressure sensitive product lines in the fourth quarter of and lower sales volumes of general purpose pressure sensitive products 
net sales were also impacted by lower prices from intense price competition in the general purpose and other pressure sensitive product lines 
offsetting these declines were increased sales of pressure sensitive sheet products 
additionally  net sales at spinnaker s entoleter business declined by million due to continued lower unit pricing 
revenues at m tron increased by million due to increased demand from the telecommunications industry and increased sales of new products 
lynch systems revenues increased by million due to increased order flow and sales of glass press machines 
operating loss operating loss for was million compared to an operating profit of 
million in spinnaker s operating loss was million compared to operating profit of million in spinnaker s operating results primarily reflect lower operating margins  increased depreciation and amortization associated with capital expenditures used in the manufacturing process  lower product volumes  and an increase in product development costs 
spinnaker recognized certain restructuring charges  affiliated with its coating business  during the fourth quarter of approximately million and had previously recorded approximately 
million in the first quarter of to better concentrate on coating s strengths and market niche  the decision was made by spinnaker management to reorganize and realign the business in the fourth quarter of and going forward in the restructuring involved the elimination of product lines and related manufacturing operations  outsourcing of non core manufacturing processes and the termination of seven salaried employees  primarily senior management 
m tron s operating profit increased by million to million due to increased volume and increased margins 
lynch systems operating profit increased by million to million due to increased order volume and a significant increase in margins over depressed levels 
other income expense investment income decreased by 
million due to the utilization of restricted cash from the sale of spinnaker s industrial tape units to buy back debt which reduced the funds available for short term investments 
interest expense was million and decreased by 
million from the prior year primarily due to the reduction of spinnaker s senior notes by the repurchase mentioned above  offset by interest costs for short term borrowings at various subsidiaries 
in addition  spinnaker recognized an impairment loss of million in its investment in certain warrants as a result of the decline during the third and fourth quarter of in the underlying value of the stock associated with such warrants 
the income tax benefit includes federal  as well as state and local taxes 
the tax benefit for the year ended december   and  represents effective tax rates of for and for the 
table of contents differences from the federal statutory rate are principally due to the effect of state income taxes  foreign sales amortization of non deductible goodwill and a valuation allowance on spinnaker s deferred tax assets 
minority interests contribution to the net income loss increased by million for the year from the prior year due to the increased losses from continuing operations at spinnaker 
net loss for the year ended december   was million  or per share  which compares to the net loss of million  or per share  for the same period of  due primarily to the operating losses mentioned above  offset by spinnaker s gain on repurchase of its senior notes million after income taxes and minority interest 
liquidity and capital resources excluding spinnaker industries the discussion below excludes the impact of spinnaker  which was deconsolidated at september  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
thus  the discussion below reflects liquidity and capital resource matters for the company s remaining consolidated subsidiaries at december  at december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
working capital was therefore million as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   an improvement over the to ratio at december  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in compared to cash used of approximately million in capital expenditures  on a comparable basis  were million in and million in capital expenditures in may return to the level of million 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under various credit facilities at the subsidiaries to fund such capital expenditures 
at december   total debt was million  which was million less than the million outstanding at the end of the reduction in debt is primarily due to reductions in the revolving credit loans 
debt outstanding at december  included thousand of fixed interest rate debt  at an interest rate  and million of variable interest rate debt at a year end average rate of 
in may of  lynch systems entered into an agreement with a bank for a million line of credit to be used only for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
this line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and inventories 
amounts available under this line of credit will be used to fund letters of credit securing customer advances and certain warranty coverages 
in august of  m tron entered into a credit agreement with its bank to set the line at million  including a million working capital line 
in addition  the company has aggregate lease commitments of  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lynch systems has a february commitment from another bank to provide a million export import line  a million domestic revolving credit line  and a thousand term loan 
interest rates will be variable and currently would average about percent 
all of the new lenders loan conditions have been met and the lender expects to close the loan by mid april in the event the new loan is not closed  lynch systems would pursue other alternatives that could include funding by its parent  renewing the present bank line  and entering into a lending agreement with another financing source 
in  the board of directors of lynch authorized the repurchase of  common shares 
as of december   lynch s remaining authorization is to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
on august   the company purchased  shares of its common stock from a former director  mr 
guzzetti  for a purchase price of  such purchase price was equal to the outstanding principal amount and unpaid interest on the loans made by the company to mr 
guzzetti on june  and september  to finance his original purchase of such common stock 
the board of directors has adopted a policy of not paying cash dividends  a policy which is reviewed annually 
this policy takes into account the long term growth objectives of the company  especially its 
table of contents acquisition program  shareholders desire for capital appreciation of their holdings and the current tax law disincentives for corporate dividend distributions 
accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in see note to the consolidated financial statements for restrictions on the companies assets 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments approximately million at december  
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company generally maintains the majority of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a fixed long term basis 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
there has been no significant change in market risk since december  at december   approximately million of the company s debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are slightly affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt  and assuming a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense would change by only million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  investments  and trade accounts receivable 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short investments with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are located throughout the country and the company s policy is designed to limit exposure to any one institution 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the company s investment strategy 
other than certain accounts receivable  the company does not require collateral on these financial instruments 
in relation to export sales  the company requires letters of credit supporting a significant portion of the sales price prior to production to limit exposure to credit risk 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses 
risk factors certain subsidiaries and business segments of the company sell to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
any downturns in the economic environment would have a financial impact on the company and its consolidated subsidiaries and may cause the reported financial information herein not to be indicative of future operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
future activities and operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuating demand for capital goods such as large glass presses  delay in the recovery of demand for components used by telecommunications infrastructure manufacturers  disruption of foreign economies and the inability to renew or obtain new financing for expiring loans
