compucom s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon compucom s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires compucom to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
compucom bases its estimates on historical experience and on other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec recently released financial reporting release no 
 which requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was recently released by the sec to require all companies to include a discussion to address  among other matters  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments

the following is a listing of compucom s critical accounting policies and a brief discussion of each 
allowance for doubtful accounts  
revenue recognition  
intangible assets and goodwill  and 
income taxes allowance for doubtful accounts 
compucom s allowance for doubtful accounts relate to trade and vendor accounts receivable 
footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the activity in these accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
the company specifically analyzes trade and vendor receivables  and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  changes in customer payment terms and the complexities of vendor mandated program requirements  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or vendors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize more of its receivables in the future than previously estimated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 
in the fourth quarter of  after a thorough analysis of the above noted criteria and the significant risk reduction in the company s receivable portfolios  the company recorded a million adjustment to reduce costs of sales relating to the receivable portfolios 
revenue recognition 
compucom derives revenue from primarily two sources product sales which consist of sales of personal computer related products  including desktop  networking  storage  and mobile computing products  as well as peripherals and software related products and licenses and services which consist primarily of application design  development and maintenance  all aspects of desktop outsourcing  including field engineering  as well as help desk and lan wan network outsourcing  configuration  asset tracking  software management  mobile computing services  it consulting  training  and services provided in support of certain manufacturers direct fulfillment initiatives 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compucom recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally for product sales  these criteria are met at the time of delivery to a common carrier 
provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns  which historically have been immaterial 
the company analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of provisions for sales returns 
at the time of the transaction  the company determines whether the fee associated with revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company determines whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the normal payment terms  which are generally days from invoice date  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from customers 
if the company determines that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  the company defers the revenue and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  the company generally uses either a binding purchase order or signed sales agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
shipping and handling revenues are included in product revenues and costs are included in product costs 
the company s services revenue is primarily billed based on hourly rates  and the company generally recognizes revenue as these services are performed or ratably over the contract term 
compucom receives volume incentives from certain vendors related to sales activity of certain products which are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold when deemed earned 
these incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based  but can significantly fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
the company records these volume incentives when it is reasonably certain as to the amount of the earned rebate incentive 
intangible assets and goodwill 
compucom assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that compucom considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period  and 
compucom s market capitalization relative to net book value if compucom determines that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company assesses the recoverability of the intangibles by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flow of the acquired operations 
any impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective  and as a result  compucom will cease to amortize goodwill at january  compucom recorded approximately million of goodwill and intangible amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
sfas no 
will require the company to test goodwill for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
goodwill is considered impaired and a loss is recognized when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value 
the company may use a number of valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and revenue multiples 
as an overall check on the reasonableness of the fair values attributed to the company s reporting units  the company will consider comparing and contrasting the aggregate fair values for all reporting units with the company s average total market capitalization for a reasonable period of time 
however  sfas no 
states that the fair value may exceed market capitalization due to factors such as control premiums and synergies 
the company is required to complete the initial impairment review during the first half of any transitional impairment loss  which could be significant  will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes 
compucom is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
compucom has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets representing future deductions  as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these deductions 
compucom considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event compucom were to determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business combinations in january  compucom purchased certain assets of microage technology services  llc mts  or the mts acquisition 
the assets were purchased out of bankruptcy court and primarily consisted of trade accounts receivable as well as vendor accounts receivable and inventory 
the purchase price of approximately million after post closing adjustments was financed using available cash 
the purchased assets were used by mts primarily in its business as a systems integrator of personal computer products 
as part of the mts acquisition  the company also hired certain of mts national sales force  technical service personnel and administrative personnel 
in july  compucom purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of excell data corporation excell  or the excell acquisition for approximately million in available cash  pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement entered into by and among compucom  excell and cambridge technology partners  inc cambridge  the parent of excell 
at the time of the acquisition  safeguard held a equity ownership interest in cambridge 
the net assets acquired were used by excell primarily in its business of high end technical applications development  network infrastructure design and deployment and worldwide event technical planning and support 
essentially all of the excell workforce  consisting of technical application developers  consultants  and administrative personnel were hired as part of the excell acquisition 
the purpose of the excell acquisition was to expand the suite of compucom s service offerings 
in november  compucom purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the application development division of e certify corporation clientlink  or the clientlink acquisition for approximately million in available cash and the surrender of such number of e certify corporation s common stock to decrease the company s percent ownership from to of outstanding shares 
clientlink provides high end technical consulting  development  deployment and maintenance services 
the clientlink acquisition further expands the suite of compucom s service offerings 
since  the company accounted for their investment in e certify using the equity method 
in november  compucom acquired northern nef  inc nnef  or the nnef acquisition for approximately million in available cash 
nnef is a federal systems integrator and solutions provider  whose services include systems engineering  software development  integration  test and training as well as related program management support services to various defense and civilian agencies of the federal government  as well as to state governments and commercial accounts 
the nnef acquisition provides compucom with an entrance to the federal marketplace and expands the capabilities nnef can provide primarily to its federal clients through compucom s existing service offerings 
compared to product revenue  which is primarily derived from the sale of desktop  networking  storage  and mobile computing products  as well as peripherals and software related products and licenses to corporate and government clients  decreased approximately to billion in from billion in this decrease was primarily a result of both a decline in units sold and lower average selling prices 
compucom believes this decrease can be primarily attributed to general economic conditions which has resulted in lower demand for personal computer products mainly from its fortune client base 
as a result of this economic slowdown  product purchases and it projects are being delayed  downsized or cancelled 
in addition  product revenue has been negatively impacted not only by certain clients electing to participate in certain manufacturers direct fulfillment programs  thereby fulfilling their product requirements directly from the manufacturer but also from increased competition from other direct marketers 
partially offsetting the overall decrease in product revenue was incremental product revenue realized as a result of the mts acquisition as well as a increase in software license revenue from million in to million in compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product gross margin is the difference between product revenue and the cost of that product revenue 
the cost of product revenue consists primarily of the price compucom pays to acquire the product from the vendor 
product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue increased to in from in  while product gross margin dollars declined million to million 
the decline in product gross margin dollars was primarily a result of the decline in product revenue 
compucom believes the increase in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to the decline in revenue generated by higher volume  lower margin clients 
also contributing to the product gross margin percentage increase was an increase  as a percentage of product revenue  in the amount of vendor volume incentives earned in as compared to each quarter compucom performs a risk assessment relating to the collectibility of receivables  the realizability of inventories and the likelihood of the collection of vendor rebate receivables 
during  the balance sheet amounts relating to receivables  inventories and vendor rebate receivables declined   and  respectively 
as a result  compucom believes its balance sheet risk also lessened  resulting in a fourth quarter favorable adjustment to product cost of million 
partially offsetting the overall increase in product gross margin percentage was the impact of the increase in software license revenue  which has a lower average gross margin than other product sales 
due to both the weak overall economic environment and competitive conditions  compucom expects to continue to experience competitive pressure on both product revenue and product gross margin  the result of which may be to report lower product revenue and product gross margin when compared to the comparable prior year period or previous quarter 
service revenue increased approximately to million in from million in service revenue is primarily derived from application design  development and maintenance  all aspects of desktop outsourcing  including field engineering  as well as help desk and lan wan network outsourcing  configuration  asset tracking  software management  mobile computing services  it consulting  network infrastructure and deployment  event technical planning and support  and services provided in support of certain manufacturers direct fulfillment initiatives 
service revenue reflects revenue generated by the actual performance of specific services and does not include product sales associated with service projects 
the increase in service revenue was primarily due to service revenue related to field engineering and the impact of the excell acquisition 
the increase in service revenue related to field engineering was primarily due to the mts acquisition 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in demand for services directly related to the sale of desktop  networking  and mobile computing products  such as configuration and installation services  and it consulting services 
service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in service gross margin was primarily due to pricing pressure on the company s service offerings 
in addition  service gross margin percentage realized on excell revenue is lower relative to the collective gross margin percentage of the company s other service related offerings 
compucom expects to experience continued pressure on both service revenue and service gross margin  the result of which may be to report lower service revenue and related service gross margin when compared to the comparable prior year period or previous quarter 
selling expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions and benefits for sales and sales support personnel  along with other costs directly related to such personnel 
selling expense decreased approximately million in as compared to compucom attributes this decrease to its own cost management efforts  primarily related to sales support personnel and related costs  chiefly telecommunications expense  as well as reductions in selling expenses that vary directly with the decline in product revenue 
selling expense as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately of revenue in from approximately in  due primarily to the decline in product revenue for the comparable periods 
service expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits cost for personnel supporting the service business  along with other costs directly related to such personnel 
service expenses increased approximately million in as compared to the increase was due primarily to personnel and training costs  as well as investments in the service infrastructure associated with supporting the service business 
a portion of this increase relates to the added personnel and infrastructure costs associated with the excell acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  service expense increased to in from in contributing to the increase in service expense as a percentage of total revenue was the decline in product revenue 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive  operations  information services  and administrative personnel  along with certain infrastructure costs directly related to such personnel  as well as professional services and other general corporate activities 
general and administrative expense decreased approximately million in versus the decrease is reflective of the company s ongoing cost management efforts which include personnel related costs  as well as certain infrastructure costs  primarily telecommunications expense 
general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue from in to in due primarily to the decline in product revenue 
operating expenses are reported net of reimbursements by certain manufacturers for specific training  promotional and marketing programs 
these reimbursements offset certain expenses incurred 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million in  a increase over the increase was primarily due to depreciation related to capital expenditures for upgrades to the company s technology infrastructure  personal computer deployments to certain personnel  including those hired as part of the mts acquisition  and certain other capital investments associated with the mts acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  this expense increased from in to in primarily due to the decline in product revenue 
financing expense decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to the decrease in financing expense was primarily due to compucom s improved management of working capital  as well as lower financing requirements due to the decline in product revenue 
the decline in financing expense was also due to the effect of higher interest income generated from investing increased available cash as well as a decrease in compucom s average effective interest rate in to as compared to in as a result of the factors discussed above  compucom recorded net earnings in of million  up when compared to net earnings in were million  including an after tax restructuring charge of million 
compared to product revenue  which is primarily derived from the sale of desktop  networking  storage  and mobile computing products  as well as peripherals and software related products and licenses to corporate and government clients  decreased approximately to billion in from billion in compucom believes product revenue was negatively impacted by manufacturer direct selling and fulfillment initiatives as well as lower product demand when compared to higher than normal spending by compucom s clients in as part of their preparation for the year these factors were partially offset by the positive impact of the acquisition of the technology acquisition services division tasd of entex information services  inc  which occurred in may product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to increased competition from direct marketers and other companies who sell personal computer products 
service revenue decreased approximately to million in from million in service revenue is primarily derived from all aspects of desktop outsourcing  including field engineering  as well as help desk and lan wan network outsourcing  configuration  asset tracking  software management  mobile computing services  it consulting  and services provided in support of certain manufacturers direct fulfillment initiatives 
service revenue reflects revenue generated by the actual performance of specific services and does not include product sales associated with service projects 
the decline in service revenue was primarily due to lower demand for consulting services 
compucom believes the decline in consulting services revenue can be primarily attributed to its clients year concerns and higher spending on year related projects that occurred in and not in this decline was partially offset by increases in revenue related to field engineering and services provided in support of certain manufacturers direct fulfillment initiatives 
service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue increased to in from in the increase in service gross margin was due primarily to improvements in the management and utilization of service related resources and a greater mix of services being performed that generally have a higher gross margin 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selling expense decreased approximately million in as compared to selling expense as a percentage of revenue declined to approximately of revenue in from approximately for the same prior year period 
compucom attributes this decrease primarily to its own cost reduction efforts  as well as that certain integration costs incurred in as part of the tasd acquisition were not incurred in service expenses increased approximately million in compared to as a percentage of revenue  service expense increased to in from in the increase was due primarily to personnel costs and investments in the service infrastructure associated with supporting the service business  as well as enhancements and additions of new service offerings  partially offset by the impact of the april e certify merger whereby clientlink was no longer a consolidated subsidiary 
consequently  service expense in does not reflect clientlink s operating expenses 
general and administrative expense increased approximately million in versus general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue from in to in due primarily to the decline in total revenue for the comparable periods 
operating expenses are reported net of reimbursements by certain manufacturers for specific training  promotional and marketing programs 
these reimbursements offset certain expenses incurred 
depreciation and amortization expense was relatively flat in as compared to in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
reflected in depreciation and amortization expense was the impact of goodwill amortization related to the may tasd acquisition for the full year however  this impact was offset by additional goodwill amortization of million recorded in related to the completion of the allocation of the purchase price of two acquisitions 
financing expense decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to this decline was primarily due to two factors greater financing requirements in mainly due to the tasd acquisition  and compucom s ability to improve its management of working capital  resulting in lower financing needs 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in compucom s effective interest rate in to as compared to in during the second quarter of  compucom recognized a pretax gain of approximately million on the sale of a portion of its investment in opus corporation opus 
the gain was the result of the company s participation in the initial public offering of opus stock 
in december  compucom recognized a million impairment charge for its investment in opus as such investment was judged to have experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
as a result of the factors discussed above  compucom recorded net earnings in of million  including an after tax restructuring charge of approximately million  compared to net earnings of million in liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily the result of declines in receivables and inventories  offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in receivables was primarily due to the decline in revenue  particularly in the fourth quarter  when revenue was less than fourth quarter partially offsetting the impact of lower revenue levels was a million reduction in the amount of receivables utilized under compucom s securitization facility 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower product demand as well as the company s ongoing efforts to minimize risk associated with suppliers price protection and returns programs by maintaining lower inventory levels 
these factors resulted in an improvement in inventory turns from in to in compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations while compucom s liquidity continues to be negatively impacted by the dollar volume of certain manufacturers rebate programs  significant improvement was realized during under these programs  compucom is required to pay a higher initial amount for product and claim a rebate from the manufacturer to reduce the final cost 
the collection of these rebates can take an extended period of time 
due to these programs  compucom s initial cost for the product is often higher than the sales price compucom can obtain from its clients 
these programs have been at times a material factor in compucom s financing needs 
as of december  and  compucom was owed approximately million and million  respectively  under these vendor rebate programs 
these amounts are included as a reduction to accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
compucom s working capital requirements are generally funded through financing arrangements and internally generated funds 
as of december   financing arrangements consisted of a million securitization securitization and a million working capital line of credit revolver 
consistent with its financing requirements  during the company reduced the securitization facility from million to million and reduced the revolver facility from million to million 
the securitization pricing is based on a designated short term interest rate plus an agreed upon spread 
amounts outstanding as sold receivables as of december  consisted of two certificates totaling million  one certificate for million with an april maturity date and one certificate for million with an october maturity date 
compucom expects the agreement relative to the million certificate to be renewed no later than its expiration in april the revolver  which matures in may and is expected to be renewed no later than its maturity date  bears interest at libor plus an agreed upon spread and is secured by a lien on compucom s assets 
availability under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation 
as of december   availability under the revolver was million with no outstanding amounts 
terms of the revolver limit the amounts available for capital expenditures and dividends 
both the securitization and the revolver require compucom to maintain compliance with selected financial covenants and ratios 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was approximately and in and  respectively 
compucom s business is not capital asset intensive  and capital expenditures in any year normally would not be significant in relation to its overall financial position 
generally  the company s capital expenditures relate to its information technology hardware and software and improvements in its distribution centers 
capital expenditures were approximately million in as compared to approximately million in this increase was primarily due to upgrades to the company s technology infrastructure  system deployments to certain personnel  including those hired as part of the mts acquisition  and certain other capital investments associated with the mts acquisition 
compucom currently expects its capital expenditure requirements in to be in a range between to million

also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 compucom will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
will require compucom to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill and equity method goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
compucom will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  compucom must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
as an overall check on the reasonableness of the fair values attributed to compucom s reporting units  the company will consider comparing and contrasting the aggregate fair values for all reporting units with the company s average total market capitalization for a reasonable period of time
