results of operations net interest income represents the gross profit from the lending and investment activities of a banking organization and is the most significant factor affecting the earnings of the company 
net interest income is influenced by changes in interest rates  volume and the mix of these various components 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for was million  which represented a decrease from the previous year 
in  taxable equivalent net interest income increased to approximately million from approximately million in actual net interest income for was million  a decrease from million recorded in the decrease in net interest income is primarily attributable to the decline in the earning asset rate resulting from the dramatic reduction in the prime lending rate throughout the prime lending rate declined from at december  to at december  the rate decline was partially offset by increased balances of interest earning assets 
average loans outstanding during the fiscal year were million compared to million in  an increase of 
in the previous year  average loans outstanding were higher than average investment securities during were million compared to million in and million in trends in interest rates were sharply downward for the year as the federal reserve decreased interest rates throughout this had the effect of decreasing both the earning asset yield and the interest bearing liability rate 
during the year the decline in the earning asset yield outpaced the decline in the interest bearing liability rate 
however  the decline in interest rates did result in an increase in the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
the increased fair value resulted in increased liquidity  due to securities being called and the sale of securities at a gain 
the weighted average yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for compared to for and for this decrease in the asset yield in was primarily attributable to the decreased yield on loans 
during the current year  the yield on loans decreased basis points to from in this decline is due to variable rate loans that repriced lower throughout the year in response to decreases in the underlying index 
the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of in had increased to in  but fell to in  a decrease of basis points 
average interest bearing deposits for totaled million and totaled million in this represents an increase of million  or from million in average balances from the overall rate for interest bearing deposits decreased basis points to in compared to in the prior year 
the overall rate on purchased funds decreased basis points during average purchased funds totaled million in  with an average rate of 
this is a million decrease from one year earlier 
this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced levels of fhlb advances utilized during in  average purchased funds was million 
average fhlb borrowings for was million compared to million in the average rate paid on purchased funds was  and for  and respectively 
table on page summarizes net interest income and average yields earned and rates paid for the years indicated  on a tax equivalent basis 
table on page presents the changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to volume and rate changes between and  and between and non interest income and expense non interest income of million in was million  or  more than the previous year amount of million 
in  non interest income was million 
one category of noninterest income  gain on sale of securities  experienced significant increases in compared to due to changes in the interest rate environment during the year 
gains on sale of securities for totaled million  up from  in and  in service charges on deposit accounts increased to million from million in and million in the company was able to capitalize on increased fees and increased volume of demand deposits and other accounts with service charges 
personnel expense of million in  exceeded the previous year by  or

at december   the company had approximately full time and part time employees  compared with full time and part time employees at december  occupancy expenses totaled million for  which was up from  in furniture and equipment expenses totaled million in the current year  a increase from million recorded in the efficiency ratio  which measures non interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income  was in  and compared favorably to the efficiency ratio posted in and in other expenses were million compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the reversal of  of other expenses in of a  expense recorded in the expense was recorded in based on the best estimate of cost to cancel a contract with a third party data processing service provider 
the contract was cancelled during and the actual cost was approximately  income tax expense in was million  an increase from million in the effective tax rate in decreased to from in the decline in the effective tax rate for is primarily due to the reduced current expense required to provide adequate income tax provision at the year end income tax expense in was million  with an effective rate of 
the higher effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to nondeductible merger related cost incurred during that year 
financial condition the company s consolidated assets of million at year end increased over the previous year  following an increase of in total average assets increased to million in  compared to million in during the company experienced a increase in average earning assets 
average earning assets totaled million in compared to million in the increase in was driven by an increase in average outstanding loans  but mitigated by a decrease in average investment securities balance 
growth in earning assets was supported by an increase of in average non interest bearing deposits  and a in interest bearing deposits 
loan growth during was million  with outstanding loans up at year end  which followed increases of in and in loans secured by real estate increased to million in and represented of total loans  compared with at year end within this category  commercial real estate loans increased during fiscal to a level of million 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans totaled million and represent of total loans  compared with last year end 
consumer loans increased during fiscal led by increased home equity loans 
management believes the company is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers concentrated in a particular industry  the loss of whose deposits or whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations 
investment securities at amortized cost of million at year end were down million  or  from year end us government agency securities continue to represent the major share of the total portfolio  and totaled million  or of the portfolio at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio one year earlier 
management believes that the additional risk of owning agency securities over us treasury securities is negligible and has capitalized on the favorable spreads available on the former 
state and municipal obligations decreased million and stood at million at year end 
the company s investment strategy is to achieve acceptable total returns  while investing in securities with relatively short maturity dates as necessary to fund loan growth 
to this end  the company has consistently categorized the entire portfolio as available for sale  which it believes offers the greatest amount of flexibility in managing a total return concept 
table on page presents the composition of the securities portfolio for the last three years  as well as information about cost  fair value and weighted average yield 
total deposits increased million to million at december  this is a increase over million in deposits one year earlier 
a million  or  increase in time deposits and a million  or  increase in demand deposits drove the annual increase during fiscal savings  now and mmi accounts decreased by million to million at year end 
the market for deposits remains fiercely competitive and the company relies on appropriate pricing and quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base 
during the year  the company had several featured products to generate new deposits and increase the customer base 
for commercial customers  the company is focused on building a total relationship  which will foster growth in both loans and deposits 
in addition to traditional checking accounts  the company offers a cash management sweep account  with outstanding balances of million at year end 
in order to attract additional deposits  the company maintains membership in an electronic network that allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits nationally 
as of december   fnb southeast had approximately of such certificates of deposit totaling million  with an overall rate of for this portfolio 
this certificate portfolio decreased by million during the company also held million in brokered certificates of deposit at december  compared to million one year earlier 
the brokered certificates have an original term of twelve months with maturities scheduled for january and april the company also has a credit facility with the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
borrowing capacity is established at of the subsidiary banks total assets as submitted on regulatory financial reports 
the company also utilized a portion of its approximately million line with the federal home loan bank of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end 
management continues to believe this is a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since a particular amount  term and structure may be selected to meet its current needs 
asset quality management places great emphasis on maintaining the company s asset quality 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the company s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed quarterly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
and related pronouncements are applied to individually significant loans 
finally  individual reserves may be recorded based on a review of loans on the watch list 
commercial loans 
all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
there is an increased reserve percentage for each successively higher risk grade 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the following table details the risk graded portfolio at december  and risk percent of commercial risk general grade description loans by grade reserve percentage risk low risk risk lower than average risk risk average risk moderately higher than risk average risk risk higher than average risk risk special mention risk substandard risk doubtful risk loss the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
during  the company reviewed the reserve percentages for commercial risk graded loans 
the change in the reserve percentages in risk grade through risk grade was made to better reflect the historical charge off experience of the company 
the reserve percentages for risk grades  risk grade  risk grade and risk grade were changed to reserve percentages preferred by banking regulators 
the net effect in  compared to earlier years  was to reserve a higher overall percentage for risk grade through risk grade  and a lower overall percentage for risk grade through risk grade the reserve percentages established in remained in effect throughout mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
retail loans 
the retail loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of retail loans to determine the required reserve for current loans and loans past due less than days 
a separate reserve is calculated for loans past due days or more 
a reserve amount equal to of all retail loans past due days or more is added to the above mentioned requirement to determine the total reserve requirement for retail loans 
specific impairment under sfas no 
management evaluates individually significant loans in risk grade and risk grade on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in loans considered impaired was approximately  and  respectively 
impaired loans at december  consisted of  of retail loans past due days or more  and  of risk grade and risk grade commercial loans 
calculated reserves for impaired loans at december  totaled  and  one year earlier 
risk grade loans are evaluated on an individual basis 
since these loans are considered a loss  a reserve percentage of of the outstanding balance is required 
the company had no loans risk graded at december  watch list review 
specific allowances may be determined based on a review of specific watch list loans 
specific losses are estimated at each measurement date 
the company has established a monthly procedure to review all loans placed on the watch list 
the watch list primarily consist of loans classified as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
an estimated loss amount and action plan is established for each watch list loan 
by reviewing these watch list loans  the company is able to update original probable loss amounts in light of developing conditions 
this serves to reduce the differences between estimated and actual observed losses 
the provision for credit losses of million compares with million in  which equals an decrease in in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a provision for credit losses of million 
this action was taken as part of the company s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio and other credit risk factors 
during credit quality remained good  and the levels of non performing loans and charge offs have remained at comparatively low levels 
net charge offs increased in to  or of average loans outstanding  compared with  or of average loans outstanding in the prior year 
at december  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of year end loans was  the same as at december  during and at december   the company observed a migration in the risk graded commercial loan portfolio to risk grades indicative of higher credit risk 
specifically  as indicated in the table above  there was a migration from risk grade to risk grade and risk grade this migration was partially offset by a decrease in retail loans past due days or more from those existing at december  risk grade loans classified special mention  substandard and doubtful decreased from million at year end to million at year end the reserve requirement for this category of loans totaled million for both years 
retail loans past due days or more at december  were  with a  reserve requirement 
this compares to  in retail loans past due days or more and a reserve requirement of  at december  the table below summarizes the company s allowance as a percentage of total loans outstanding and net charge off percentage for the past five years 
allowance percentage net charge off percentage non performing assets include non accrual loans  accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more  restructured loans  and other real estate 
loans are placed on non accrual status when i management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan principal and interest and ii generally when such loans are ninety days or more past due 
no assurance can be given  however  that economic conditions will not adversely affect borrowers and result in increased credit losses 
capital resources banks and financial holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the federal reserve has adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are required to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to its assets in accordance with the guidelines 
as shown in table on page  the company and the subsidiary bank both maintained capital levels exceeding the minimum levels to be well capitalized for the three years presented 
effective in march  fnb southeast converted from a national bank  regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency  to a north carolina bank  regulated by the commissioner 
fnb southeast will continue to be required to meet certain levels of capital 
liquidity management liquidity management refers to the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the company s customers 
deposit withdrawals  loan funding and general corporate activity create a need for liquidity for the company 
liquidity is derived from sources such as deposit growth  maturity  calls  or sales of investment securities  principal and interest payments on loans  access to borrowed funds or lines of credit  and profits 
the investment portfolio at december   held securities with call features  whereby the issuer of such a security has the option to repay the purchaser of said instrument and cancels the instrument before the contractual maturity date 
due to the interest rate on the original instrument and current market rates on such instruments  the company anticipates that certain debt instruments in the portfolio may be called in the upcoming year 
during  the company deployed cash flow from operating and financing activities to fund increases in the loan portfolio 
overall  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the company generated million in operating cash flow during  down from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount that interest received exceeded interest paid in each year 
in  the excess was only million  while in  the excess was million 
this change resulted from the falling interest rate environment in  and the company s inability to decrease rates paid on deposits as quickly as the yield on loans dropped 
in  the company had a net increase of million in loans compared to million in in  the company received million from sales and calls of securities  while purchasing million 
the turnover in the security portfolio was attributable to the reduction in interest rates throughout the year 
in  the company purchased million of securities  while receiving million from sales and calls and  from maturities 
the company s major financing sources during were a million increase in savings  now and mmi deposits and a million increase in time deposits  for a combined total of million 
this is lower than the combined million increase in deposits during the deposit growth during the year allowed the company to reduce fhlb borrowings by million 
time deposits increased million and borrowings increased million in liquidity is further enhanced by an approximately million line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb collateralized by fhlb stock  investment securities and qualifying to family residential mortgage loans 
the company provides various reports to the fhlb on a regular basis throughout the year to maintain the availability of the credit line 
each borrowing request to the fhlb is initiated through an advance application that is subject to approval by the fhlb before funds are advanced under the credit agreement 
the company also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million available through four financial institutions 
these lines are used to manage the day to day  short term liquidity needs of the company 
each federal funds line has a requirement to repay the line in full on a frequent basis  typically within five to ten business days 
the company also projects future cash flow requirements based on scheduled loan and deposit maturities  borrowing maturities  capital expenditures and other factors 
at december  and for the upcoming twelve month period  the company had scheduled loan maturities of million  securities maturities of  and million in maturing time deposits 
the company also has million in deposits with no contractual maturity that are subject to withdrawal during the company also has of borrowings that are scheduled for repayment in anticipated capital expenditures during are approximately million 
internal analysis indicated the company is positioned to meet expected liquidity requirements during the upcoming twelve month period 
the company also has off balance sheet arrangements with customers that may impact the overall liquidity needs 
these commitments and contingent liabilities are commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the following table presents commitments and contingent liabilities at december  one year over one and less year total commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit total commitments and contingent liabilities   market risk market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities

effects of inflation inflation affects financial institutions in ways that are different from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on net interest margins as a major source of earnings 
non interest expenses  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment cost  are also negatively affected by inflation 
new accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
this statement carries forward without reconsideration those portions of apb opinion no 
 business combinations  that provide guidance related to the application of the purchase method 
this statement requires that intangible assets that meet certain criteria be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june  this statement also applies to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
it addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
this statement carries forward without reconsideration those provisions of opinion related to the accounting for internally developed intangible assets 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  and early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march   under certain conditions 
impairment losses for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of this statement resulting from a transitional impairment test are to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset to be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  early application is encouraged 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas and applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
based on the company s operations as of december   none of these standards had a material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk management is a part of the company s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the company s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of senior management and members of the company s board of directors 
the committee meets on a regular basis to review the asset liability management activities of the company and monitor compliance with established policies 
a member of the board of directors chairs the committee and reports on its activities to the full board 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the company s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates which are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is a technique traditionally used in asset liability management 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
table on page indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be 
this ratio indicates that net interest income would decline in a rising interest rate environment  since a greater amount of liabilities than assets would reprice more quickly over the one year period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  yet have no stated maturity 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
this analysis assumes of now and savings accounts  and of mmi accounts  reprice within one year  and the remaining balances reprice after one year 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the company s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio has a variable rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 
in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the company also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  rate shock net interest margin analysis  and asset liability term and rate analysis 
the company uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income for the company 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and calculates the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming twelve month period 
the company s asset liability policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the company is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk  which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the company is asset sensitive  which means that falling interest rates could result in a reduced amount of net interest income 
the company is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk

fnb southeast s primary deposit products are interest bearing checking accounts  certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 
its primary lending products are commercial  real estate  and consumer loans 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and their reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans 
a majority of the subsidiary bank s loan portfolio consists of loans in the geographic areas cited above 
the local economies of these areas depend heavily on the industrial  agricultural  and service sectors 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a large portion of the subsidiary bank s loan portfolio would be affected by changes in local economic conditions 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest bearing bank deposits 
cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and short term investments with maturities of three months or less

the company is required to maintain certain levels of frb and fhlb stock based on various criteria established by the individual issuer 
gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized when realized on a specific identification basis 
premiums and discounts are amortized into interest income using the level yield method 
loans interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based on the principal amount outstanding 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when interest accrual is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when contractual payment becomes days past due 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
mortgage loans held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined by outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements  calculated on the aggregate loan basis 
loan origination fees and costs loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as an adjustment of the yield on the related loan 
allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses is based on management s best estimate of probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
factors impacting estimated probable loan losses include credit quality trends  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and loan volume among loan categories 
while management uses the best available information to establish the allowance for credit losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on the factors cited above

subsequent write downs are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the provision for depreciation and amortization is computed principally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives of buildings are estimated at to years and equipment are to years 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations  and the expenditures for major replacements and betterments are added to the premises and equipment accounts 
the cost and accumulated depreciation of the premises and equipment retired or sold are eliminated from the appropriate asset accounts at the time of retirement or sale and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in current operations 
income taxes provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year after exclusion of non taxable income such as interest on state and municipal securities and non deductible expenses and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled

net income per share the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no

diluted net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income plus any adjustments to net income related to the issuance of dilutive potential common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year plus the number of dilutive potential common shares 
sales of loans gains and losses on the sale of loans are accounted for by imputing gain or loss on those sales where a yield rate guaranteed to the buyer is more or less than the contract interest rate being collected 
such gains or losses are recognized in the financial statements during the year of sale 
the subsidiary bank continues to service certain loans that have been sold

cash and cash equivalents 
for cash on hand and amounts due from banks the carrying value is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value 
fnb financial services corporation and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements continued investment securities 
the fair value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices  if available 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the fair value of equity investments in the restricted stock of the federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank equals the carrying value 
loans 
the fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of variable rate loans with frequent repricing and negligible credit risk approximates book value 
deposits 
the fair value of noninterest bearing demand deposits and now  savings  and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities 
federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements 
the carrying value of federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value 
other borrowings 
other borrowings consists of fhlb borrowings with varying maturities 
the fair values of these liabilities are estimated using the discounted values of the contractual cash flows 
the discount rate is estimated using the rates currently in effect for similar borrowings 
commitments 
the fair value of commitments to extend credit is considered to approximate carrying value  since the large majority of these commitments would result in loans that have variable rates and or relatively short terms to maturity 
for other commitments  generally of a short term nature  the carrying value is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value 
the various commitment items were disclosed in note the estimated fair values of financial instruments at december are as follows carrying estimated carrying estimated value fair value value fair value in thousands financial assets cash and cash equivalents     investment securities available for sale     other equity securities     loans held for sale   loans     financial liabilities deposits     federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements     other borrowings     fnb financial services corporation and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements continued the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market and other information about the financial instruments 
because no market exists for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  fair value estimates are based on current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various financial instruments  and such other factors 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates 
in addition  the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates
