more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors of this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market worldwide solid imaging systems designed to reduce the time it takes to produce dimensional objects 
our products produce physical objects from the digital output of solid or surface data from computer aided design and manufacturing cad cam and related computer systems  and include sla systems  sls systems and thermojet solid object printers 
sla systems use our proprietary stereolithography sl technology  an additive solid imaging process which uses a laser beam to expose and solidify successive layers of photosensitive epoxy resin until the desired object is formed to precise specifications in epoxy or acrylic resin 
sls systems utilize a process called selective laser sintering ls  which uses laser energy to sinter powdered material to create solid objects from the powdered materials 
ls and sl produced parts can be used for concept models  engineering prototypes  patterns and masters for molds  consumable tooling  and short run manufacturing of final product  among other applications 
thermojet solid object printers employ hot melt ink jet technology to build models in successive layers using our proprietary thermoplastic material 
these printers  about the size of an office copier  are network ready and are designed for operation in engineering and design office environments 
the thermojet printer output can be used as patterns and molds  and when combined with other secondary processes such as investment casting  can produce parts with representative end use properties 
our customers include major corporations in a broad range of industries including service bureaus and manufacturers of automotive  aerospace  computer  electronic  consumer and medical products 
our revenues are generated by product and service sales 
product sales are comprised of sales of systems and related equipment  materials  software and other component parts  as well as rentals of systems 
service sales include revenues from a variety of on site maintenance services  customer training  services provided by our technology centers and licensing of d keltool process and support services 
for the year ended december   both revenues and earnings were affected by the general economic slowdown in capital equipment purchases  which began affecting sales to original equipment manufacturers in the second quarter of and by the impact of events surrounding september  in addition  we addressed significant challenges during the year  which diverted and consumed available resources from day to day operations 
we completed our merger with dtm corporation dtm on august  and have integrated all of their operations into our existing business 
we also acquired optoform sarl and rpc ltd 
rpc in we have spent significant time in addressing both the antitrust action  relating to the dtm merger  with the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj and the termination of our agreements with vantico 
sales of our higher end sla systems  particularly to the automotive and aviation industries  were below expectations in despite the economic downturn in  sales of the viper si sla system  introduced late in the second quarter  continued to grow with a total of units sold in in addition  the ls line of business acquired through the acquisition of dtm contributed significantly to our overall revenues in the second half of we expect this contribution to increase through as a result of the additional potential applications of the technology  especially relating to advanced digital manufacturing 
we expect several digital manufacturing centers to be established in the united states and europe beginning in our systems will be used for rigorous testing of mechanical and thermal functionality of parts  fluid dynamics visualization  aerodynamics testing and short production runs 
we also expect to maintain our lead position in rapid prototyping 
in this regard  we anticipate launching a new platform using a newly formulated material in to provide a new lower price option to our customers 
we plan to launch six new materials in from our range of existing technologies 
we expect that our continued emphasis on developing new materials for our systems will result in increased revenues from material sales and as a percent of our total revenue 
we believe that these measures  along with maintaining strict cost controls in  will provide opportunities for increased profitability 
these are forward looking statements and  as with other such statements  are subject to uncertainties 
for example  the exact timing of customer requirements  competitive selling and pricing issues  dependence on single suppliers  requirement for continued developments of systems and materials  commercial acceptance of new materials and the uncertainty regarding the effect of cost containment efforts may negatively impact our revenue and profitability 
on august   we completed our acquisition of dtm in which we purchased all of the outstanding shares of common stock of dtm for approximately million 
dtm s operations have been fully integrated into our existing business allowing us to begin to realize synergies and cost savings 
we believe that the acquisition will allow us to offer our customers an expanded product line and will increase our capabilities in the areas of advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling  which we have identified as areas of significant opportunity for us for and beyond 
in february  we acquired the stock and intellectual property of optoform sarl optoform 
the optoform technology is capable of producing products with metal and ceramic properties 
we believe that the acquisition of optoform will allow us to continue to expand our product offerings and increase our capabilities in the areas of advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling 
in september  the company acquired the stock of rpc ltd  a manufacturer of solid imaging material 
the aggregate purchase price was million 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory  goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations for example  bankruptcy 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change for example  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
income taxes 
the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to operations in numerous tax jurisdictions outside the united states  which are subject to certain risks  which ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  we estimate future taxable income and determine the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
future taxable income could be materially different than amounts estimated  in which case we would need to adjust the valuation allowance 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we have applied sfas no 
 business combinations in our allocation of the purchase price of the dtm and rpc acquisitions 
the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets will also require us to use our judgment and could require us to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
at this time our contingencies are not estimable and have not been recorded  however  management believes the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of systems and related products and services are recognized upon shipment  at which time title has passed to the customer  or performance 
we provide end users with up to one year of maintenance and warranty services  and defer a portion of its revenues at the time of sale based on the relative fair value of such services 
after the initial maintenance period  we offer these customers optional maintenance contracts  revenue related to these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
to date  we have not experienced any significant warranty claims or product returns 
the company s systems are sold with software products that is integral to the operation of the systems 
these software products are not sold separately 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting change in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and amended it with sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities in june it establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
was immaterial 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency risk 
international sales are made primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in united states dollars or the local currency of each country 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are denominated in united states dollars 
we manage selected exposures through financial market transactions in the form of foreign exchange forward and put option contracts 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 
at december   the notional amount covered by all of our put option contracts was million related to transactions denominated in euro and pounds sterling  with settlement dates in january and february the fair value of the put option contracts was  at december  and was recorded as other current assets on the balance sheet 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the acquisitions of dtm and rpc were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting issues for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains the fundamental provisions for a recognition measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sales 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and have not determined the impact  if any  it will have on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to total sales percentage of total sales years ended december  sales products services total sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses other expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  total sales attributable to each of the company s major products and services groups  and those sales as a percentage of total sales years ended december  in thousands  except for percentages products sla systems and related equipment sls systems and related equipment solid object printers materials other total products services maintenance other total services total sales products sla systems and related equipment sls systems and related equipment solid object printers material other total products services maintenance other total services total sales compared to sales 
sales in were million  an increase of from the million recorded in sales for reflect the consolidated results of dtm as of august  the ls product line of machines and materials contributed million in revenue in product sales of million were recorded in  an increase of compared to million for the increase in product revenue is primarily due to the consolidation of the results of dtm  with sales from the ls product line of million 
without the consolidation of dtm  product sales of million would have been recorded for  compared to million for this decrease in product sales is due primarily to the decrease in sales of sla systems and related equipment of million or 
the decrease in machine sales primarily resulted from decreased sales of the higher end sla systems  especially the sla system  primarily due to a general economic decline in higher dollar capital equipment purchases by customers 
in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in although sales of our higher end sla systems in were below the prior year  sales of our newly introduced viper si sla system exceeded expectations  with units sold in the viper si sla system became generally available on july  excluding the consolidation of million in materials revenue from dtm  materials revenue of million were recorded in  a decrease from the million recorded in the decrease in material revenue primarily reflects the sale of fewer large frame sla units 
we believe that the termination of our agreements with vantico  coupled with our acquisition of rpc  may have also impacted materials revenue 
system orders and resultant sales may fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  acceptance of new products and the timing of product shipments 
due to the price of certain systems and the overall low unit volumes  the acceleration or delay of shipments of a small number of higher end sla systems from one period to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the periods involved 
service sales in totaled million  an increase of from million in the increase primarily reflects an increase in maintenance contract revenue  coupled with the consolidation of service revenue from the dtm acquisition 
the increase in maintenance contract revenue reflects a continued emphasis of providing a multitude of maintenance contract options to our customers and enhanced selling efforts in this area  coupled with an increase in the installed base of machines 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in excluding the results of dtm  cost of sales were million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in without the consolidation of dtm  product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was in the increase as a percent of product sales in compared to is due primarily to a shift in the sales mix from higher end sla systems to our smaller systems 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the decrease is due to a change in the mix of service sales from time and materials and other service revenues to maintenance contract revenues in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million in and million for the increase primarily reflects additional expenses from the dtm acquisition  acquisition related amortization costs  legal fees related to the vantico arbitration  and bad debt write offs in the fourth quarter of additionally  the first six months of reflect an overall increase in personnel expenses and other costs as we continued to build infrastructure to support anticipated revenue growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in increased to million compared to million in excluding the results of dtm  research and development expenses were million in  or of sales compared with million in  or of sales 
this increase is primarily due to additional expenses as a result of the dtm acquisition and a higher growth in research and development spending relative to our revenue level compared to prior year 
based on our historical expenditures related to research and development and our current development goals  we anticipate  for the foreseeable future  research and development expenses will be equal to approximately to of sales 
income loss from operations 
operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million in although gross profit increased slightly for  operating expenses were higher than  resulting in an operating loss in interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other expense  net for was million compared to interest and other income  net to  in the increased expense in reflects million of interest expense and amortization of loan costs related to the new us bank term loan and revolving line of credit 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
for  our tax benefit was million or of the pre tax loss  compared to a tax provision of million or of the pre tax income in compared to sales 
sales in were million  an increase of from the million recorded in product sales in of million increased from million in the increase in product sales over the prior year was due primarily to increased sales of sla systems and related equipment of million or and an increase in material revenue of million or 
the increase in machine sales results from increased sales of the higher end sla industrial systems  especially the sla in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in the increase in material revenue was primarily due to an increase in the installed base of machines and a stronger sales and marketing emphasis on recurring revenue related to the sale of materials derived from post installation sales 
service sales in totaled million  a decrease of or million from million in the decrease in service revenue was a result of the net impact of a reduction in revenue from maintenance contracts partially offset by an increase related to time and material revenues 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in compared to in this decrease as a percent of product sales was due primarily to reduced component costs  increased manufacturing activity relative to our level of fixed overhead expenses  and a shift in the sales mix to higher end sla systems in as compared to  all of which positively impacted the overall product cost of sales as a percent of product revenue 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in from in this was attributable to a decrease in service revenue over the prior year and a change in the mix of service revenues in from maintenance contracts to time and material revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of cost reduction benefits associated with the operating plan adopted in late  more focused selling and marketing efforts and high costs associated with the launch of new products in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in decreased million or to million compared to million in this was a result of more focused engineering efforts on specific development projects and the introduction of new products in early research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in compared to in other expenses 
other expenses totaled million in no such costs were incurred in the cost incurred in related to litigation  settlement costs and non recurring charges associated with certain employee and exit plan costs 
income loss from operations 
operating income in was million or of total revenue versus an operating loss of million or of total revenue in the improvement was primarily attributable to increased revenue  improved gross margins and reduced operating expenses

the company s ability to raise additional funds through capital markets in the future could be impacted by a decrease in the stock price 
on august   we completed a million variable rate industrial development bond financing of our colorado facility 
interest on the bonds is payable monthly the interest rate at december  was 
principal payments are payable in semi annual installments beginning in february through august the bonds are collateralized by an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by wells fargo bank  na at december   a total of million was outstanding under the bond 
the terms of the letter of credit require us to maintain specific levels of minimum tangible net worth and debt to equity ratio 
we were in compliance with such covenants at december  if we were not to be in compliance with these covenants the lender could proceed against our assets  which would have a material impact on our operations 
on august   d systems  inc  a subsidiary of d systems corporation  entered into a revolving line of credit agreement line of credit which allowed d systems  inc to borrow up to million 
on august  we replaced this line of credit with a new agreement through us bank totaling million  in order to finance the acquisition of dtm 
the financing arrangement consists of a million three year revolving credit facility and a million month commercial term loan 
at december   a total of million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under the term loan 
the interest rates at december  for the revolving credit facility and term loan were and  respectively 
the interest rate applicable to both facilities will be either the prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  or the day adjusted libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the margin for each rate will vary depending upon our interest bearing debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization  ebitda 
the terms of the debt agreement requires us to maintain specific levels of minimum tangible net worth  ebitda and liquidity  along with capital expenditure restrictions 
we are in compliance with such covenants at december  pursuant to the terms of the agreement us bank has received a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangible assets 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in default under these instruments 
an event of default would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
moreover  these lenders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under these instruments 
if we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders  these lenders could proceed against our assets  which would have a material impact on our operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold convertible subordinate debentures 
as of december  we received million in proceeds from this sale 
we received additional proceeds of  in january  for a total of million 
the convertible debentures are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock immediately at the option of the holder or at our discretion at any time after december   and prior to maturity at december  the debentures bear interest at the rate of payable quarterly 
the chairman of the board of directors and related parties contributed million to the completion the convertible debentures 
we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring through december the leases are generally on a net rent basis  whereby we pay taxes  maintenance and insurance 
leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties

the future contractual payments are as follows contractual obligations later years total line of credit term loan industrial development bond subordinated debt operating leases total contractual obligations based upon current levels of operations  anticipated cost savings and future growth  we believe our cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the credit facility and our term loan which amounts to million as of december  and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for interest payments and other debt service obligations  working capital  capital expenditures and other operating needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that estimated costs savings or growth could be achieved 
future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance existing indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
cautionary statements and risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in that event the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
terrorism and the uncertainty of war may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   the response by the united states initiated on october   and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our operations and profitability 
further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses may occur 
the potential near term and long term effect these attacks may have on our customers  the market for our common stock  the markets for our services and the us economy are uncertain 
the consequences of any terrorist attacks  or any armed conflicts that may result  are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets  or our business 
our research and distribution agreements with vantico will terminate on april  if we are unable to timely and cost effectively develop resins adequate for use with our products  we may lose customers and market share and our revenues and profitability may decline 
if we cannot develop sufficient quantities of resins for use in stereolithography which are commercially accepted  we may lose customers  our revenues may decline and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
under the terms of a settlement agreement effective as of march   our research and distribution agreements with vantico will terminate april  under these agreements  we had jointly developed liquid photopolymers with vantico and served as the exclusive worldwide distributor except in japan of these materials  manufactured by vantico for use in stereolithography 
sales of our materials accounted for and of our total revenues in and on september   we acquired rpc  an independent supplier of stereolithography resins 
we may not be able to timely and cost effectively develop adequate enhancements to the existing rpc product line  or if developed  produce sufficient quantities of rpc resins and other materials that meet the needs of our customers or otherwise develop or obtain materials adequate for use with our products that are commercially accepted 
if we are able to develop or otherwise obtain commercially accepted materials  we will face significant competition for materials sales from various suppliers  including vantico 
a substantial majority of our current sla system customer base uses vantico resins 
as a result  we may lose customers and market share  our revenues may decline and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we do not have substantial experience operating a materials manufacturing business 
if we cannot cost effectively manage the materials business and the associated risks  our revenue  market share and profitability will decline 
our business strategy includes the operation and substantial expansion of the rpc materials business 
if we cannot operate the rpc business effectively  or complete the expansion timely and cost effectively  our revenue and profitability will decline and we may lose customers and market share 
our management team does not have substantial experience in the materials manufacturing business and may not be able timely to identify or anticipate all of the material risks associated with operating that business 
in addition  the materials business increases some of the existing risks we face  which we explain in our discussion in this report of other risks facing our business  and poses new risks to our company 
for example  we must comply with all applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations associated with large scale manufacturing of resins in switzerland 
our compliance with these laws may increase our cost of production and reduce our margins and any failure to comply with these laws may result in legal or regulatory action instituted against us  substantial monetary fines or other damages 
also  we intend to substantially increase production of the rpc product line which will require the retention and training of qualified employees and the timely implementation of a large scale manufacturing system capable of large volume resin production 
we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of additional qualified employees on a timely basis  or at all 
if we cannot timely and cost effectively expand and manage the rpc business  we will lose revenue  customers and market share  and our results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
our divestiture of assets under the consent decree issued by the us department of justice may not be on terms advantageous to us and may adversely affect our results of operations 
under a settlement agreement with the doj relating to our merger with dtm  we must license certain of our patents for use in the manufacture and sale of either sl or ls products  but not both  in north america 
we refer to this settlement agreement as the final judgment 
the final judgment requires that  by five days after we receive notice that the court has entered the final judgment  we must have completed the license to a company that currently manufactures either stereolithography or laser sintering machines 
the court has not yet entered the final judgment 
if we cannot complete the license within the time period provided under the final judgment  the doj may ask the court to appoint a trustee  who will be empowered to complete the license to a purchaser acceptable to the doj  on terms then obtainable by the trustee using its reasonable efforts 
any proposed license agreement is subject to doj consent 
thus  the doj may reject the licensee or seek amendment to the terms of the proposed license agreement 
consequently  we may have to license these patents on terms we do not believe are advantageous to us  and on terms that we believe may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
on february   we executed a license agreement and submitted it to the doj 
under the terms of the final judgment  we cannot complete this license until it is approved 
the doj is currently reviewing the terms of the proposed license agreement and our proposed licensee 
our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and affect our ability to run our business 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding 
as of december   our debt was million 
you should be aware that this level of debt could have important consequences to you as a holder of shares 
below we have identified for you some of the material potential consequences resulting from this significant amount of debt 
we may be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the repayment of indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash we have available for other purposes 
our ability to adapt to changing market conditions may be hampered 
we may be more vulnerable in a volatile market and at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 
our operating flexibility is more limited due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties  making acquisitions and paying dividends 
we will be subject to the risks that interest rates and our interest expense will increase 
our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business is more limited 
under certain circumstances  we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
if we add new debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our substantial amout of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay down our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
our ability to make payments on our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
insufficient cash flow could place us at risk of default under our debt agreements or could prevent us from expanding our business as planned 
our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  our strategy to increase operating efficiencies may not be realized and future borrowings may not be available to use under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs 
our failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments 
in addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations  our debt instruments include a number of covenants relating to financial ratios and tests 
the covenants include requirements that we meet certain earning levels relative to our debt 
for the year ended december   we experienced a net loss 
if we continue to have losses and we achieve no further reductions in our debt level  it will have a negative impact on our ability to comply with this requirement 
in addition  our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments 
an event of default would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
moreover  these lenders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under these instruments 
if we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders  these lenders could proceed against our assets 
the significant competition we face could cause us to lose market share or reduce prices 
to compete effectively  in this dynamic and changing business area  we may be required to reduce prices for our products  increase our operating costs  or take other measures that could adversely impact our business 
we compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of models  prototypes and other dimensional objects  ranging from traditional model makers and subtractive type producers  such as cnc machine makers  to a wide variety of additive solid imaging system manufacturers as well as service bureaus that provide any or all of these types of technology 
consequently  we are subject to the effects of technological change  innovation  and new product introductions 
some of our existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of equipment  materials and services 
in addition  we will face substantial competition for sl materials upon the termination of our distribution agreement with vantico on april  many of these competitors have financial  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
in many cases  the existence of these competitors extends the purchase decision time as customers investigate the alternative products and solutions 
also  these competitors have marketed these products successfully to our existing and potential customers 
we expect further competition will arise from the technology license agreement to be entered into pursuant to the consent final judgment issued by the us department of justice 
under the terms of the final judgment  we are required to license our existing patents with respect to either our stereolithography or laser sintering technology to a viable and ongoing commercial enterprise capable of competing effectively in the applicable market 
the licensee may introduce its existing product line into the united states  and may enhance this product line or develop new products  in either case  under the license of our existing patents 
as a consequence of our license of these patents  we may lose market share and or be required to reduce prices or take other measures that could adversely affect our results of operations in an effort to remain competitive 
we also expect future competition may arise from the termination of our distribution agreement with vantico  the development of allied or related techniques  both additive and subtractive  that are not encompassed by our patents  the issuance of patents to other companies that inhibit our ability to develop certain products  and the improvement to existing technologies 
we have determined to follow a strategy of continuing product development and aggressive patent prosecution to protect our position to the extent practicable 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
we  as successor to dtm  currently are involved in intellectual property litigation  the outcome of which could materially and adversely affect us 
on august   we completed our acquisition of dtm 
as the successor to dtm  we face direct competition for selective laser sintering equipment and materials outside the united states from eos gmbh of planegg  germany  which we refer to as eos 
prior to our acquisition  dtm had been involved in significant litigation with eos in france  germany  italy  japan and the united states with regard to its proprietary rights to selective laser sintering technology 
eos has also challenged the validity of patents related to laser sintering in the european patent office and the japanese patent office 
in addition  eos filed a patent infringement suit against dtm in federal court in california alleging that dtm infringed certain us patents that we license to eos 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully defend against the claims of invalidity and infringement 
our inability to resolve the claims or to prevail in any related litigation could result in a finding of infringement of our licensed patents 
additionally  one eos patent is asserted which  if found valid and infringed  could preclude the continued development and sale of certain of our laser sintering products that incorporate the intellectual property that is the subject of the patent 
in addition  we may become obligated to pay substantial monetary damages for past infringement 
regardless of the outcome of these actions we will continue to incur significant related expenses and costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
furthermore  these actions could involve a substantial diversion of the time of some members of management 
the failure to preserve our laser sintering intellectual property rights and the costs associated with these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition and could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the mix of products we sell affects our overall profit margins 
we continuously expand our product offerings  including our materials  and work to increase the number of geographic markets in which we operate and the distribution channels we use in order to reach our various target markets and customers 
this variety of products  markets and channels results in a range of gross margins and operating income which can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations depending on the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter 
we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross margins or net income due to the impact of the mix of products  channels  or geographic markets utilized from period to period 
more recentrly  our mix of products sold has reflected increased sales of our lower end systems which have reduced gross margins as compared to the high end sla systems 
if this trend continues over time  we may experience lower average gross margins and returns 
our operating results vary from quarter to quarter  which could impact our stock price 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
in some quarters it is possible that results could be below expectations of analysts and investors 
if so  the price of our common stock may decline 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause these fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include acceptance and reliability of new products in the market  size and timing of product shipments  currency and economic fluctuations in foreign markets and other factors affecting international sales  price competition  delays in the introduction of new products  general worldwide economic conditions  changes in the mix of products and services sold  impact of ongoing litigation  and impact of changing technologies 
in addition  certain of our components require an order lead time of three months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become more difficult to obtain in the future 
we may experience delays in the receipt of some key components 
to meet forecasted production levels  we may be required to commit to long lead time items prior to receiving orders for our products 
if our forecasts exceed actual orders  we may hold large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for specified components 
if these relationships terminate  our business may be disrupted while we locate an alternative supplier 
we subcontract for manufacture of material laser sintering components  powdered sintering materials and accessories from a single source third party supplier 
there are several potential suppliers of the material components  parts and subassemblies for our stereolithography products 
however  we currently use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of the critical components  parts and subassemblies  including our lasers  materials and certain ink jet components 
our reliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves many risks including shortages of some key components  product performance shortfalls  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capabilities  quality and costs 
if any of our suppliers suffers business disruptions  financial difficulties  or if there is any significant change in the condition of our relationship with the supplier  our costs of goods sold may increase or we may be unable to obtain these key components for our products 
in either event  our revenues  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition would be adversely affected 
while we believe we can obtain most of the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers  any unanticipated change in the source of our supplies  or unanticipated supply limitations  could adversely affect our ability to meet our product orders 
if we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products  we may lose revenue and market share 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
we are affected by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices 
these developments could render our existing products and proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing products  develop new products and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  particularly in the area of material functionality  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  and retain key technology employees 
also  new technologies or materials that render our existing products and services obsolete may be developed 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs 
we expect that our merger with dtm and our acquisitions of rpc and optoform sarl will allow us to expand our product offerings and increase capabilities to expand into advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will develop the optoform technology on a cost effective basis or at all  or if developed  that it will lead to commercially viable products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the acquisition of dtm or rpc will enable us to further expand into advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling 
our new products may require refinement following introduction and may not be commercially accepted 
in july our newest sla and sls systems were introduced 
although these products undergo thorough quality assurance testing  we have encountered problems in connection with prior new product introductions  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fix any new problems that arise in a timely manner  or at all 
also  we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will be commercially accepted 
if there are material problems with our new products  or if the marketplace does not accept these products  our revenues and profitability may decline and we may lose market share 
we face risks associated with conducting business internationally and if we do not manage these risks  our results of operations may suffer 
a material portion of our sales is to customers in foreign countries 
there are many risks inherent in our international business activities that  unless managed properly  may adversely affect our profitability 
our foreign operations could be adversely affected by unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls  tariffs and other barriers  social and political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  taxation  and other factors  depending on the country in which an opportunity arises 
in order to manage our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we have entered into hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions include purchases of options or forward contracts to minimize the risk associated with cash payments from foreign subsidiaries to d inc however  we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will provide us adequate protection in our foreign operations  and consequently our overall revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expense protecting our patents and proprietary rights  which we believe are critical to our success 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we intend to pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and other proprietary rights 
we have incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition and could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
as of december   we held patents  which include in the united states  in europe  in japan  and in other foreign jurisdictions 
at that date  we had pending patent applications with the united states  in the pacific rim  in europe  in canada and in latin america 
as we discover new developments and components to our technology  we intend to apply for additional patents 
effective trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available 
we cannot assure you that the pending patent applications will be granted or that we have taken adequate steps to protect our proprietary rights  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
we currently are involved in several patent infringement actions 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop or initiate technologies that are substantially similar or superior to ours 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain a meaningful technological advantage over our competitors 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite our testing  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers  which could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
we attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products 
however  the nature and extent of such limitations vary from customer to customer  and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
volatility of stock price 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
historically  our stock price has been volatile 
the prices of the common stock have ranged from to during the week period ended february  factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include future announcements concerning our developments or those of our competitors  including the receipt of substantial orders for products  quality deficiencies in services or products  results of technological innovations  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  proprietary rights or product  patent or other litigation  and sales or purchase of substantial blocks of stock 
the loss of members of the management team provided by regent pacific management corporation for our executive management may disrupt our business 
we depend on the management and leadership of a team provided to us by regent pacific management corporation 
the loss of any member of this team could materially adversely affect our business 
the management services provided under our agreement with regent pacific include the services of brian k 
service as president and chief executive officer and certain other executives 
our agreement with regent pacific expires on september  if the agreement with regent pacific were canceled  the loss of the regent pacific personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations  especially during any transition phase to new management 
similarly  if any adverse change in our relationship with regent pacific occurs  it could hinder management s ability to direct our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
takeover and defense provisions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
various provisions of our corporate governance documents and of delaware law  together with our shareholders rights plan  may inhibit changes in control not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of depriving you of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover 
the board is authorized to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock 
the board also is authorized to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
our ability to issue preferred stock gives us flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financing  but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  any preferred stock to be issued may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts or making it more difficult for stockholders to change management 
we are subject to delaware laws that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of our company 
one of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
in addition  we have adopted a shareholders rights plan 
under the shareholders rights plan  we distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could dilute your ownership and negatively impact the market price for our common stock 
we have outstanding debentures that are convertible into common stock at the holders option at a conversion price of per share 
if the holders elect to convert all million principal amount of the debentures  we would be obligated to issue  shares of our common stock at per share 
to the extent that all of the debentures are converted  a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock will be outstanding and the interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted 
moreover  future sales of substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and long term debt 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds or other high quality investments 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to this factor  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility and term loan with us bank  which have variable interest rates 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our term loan 
the interest rates at december  for the revolving credit facility and the term loan were and  respectively 
the revolving credit facility expires in we are required to pay quarterly payments on our term loan of  through an increase or decrease in the variable interest rate of would increase or decrease our interest expense by  we have an industrial development bond on our colorado facility  which has an outstanding balance of million 
we will make annual principal payments of      for the years ending     and  thereafter 
the bond has a variable interest rate and the interest rate at december  was 
an increase or decrease in the variable interest rate of would increase or decrease our interest expense by  we have not entered into any hedging contracts to protect ourselves against future changes in interest rates  which could negatively impact the amount of interest we are required to pay 
however  we do not feel that this risk is significant and we do not plan to attempt to hedge to mitigate this risk in the foreseeable future 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold convertible subordinate debentures 
as of december  we received million in proceeds from this sale 
we received additional proceeds of  in january  for a total of million 
the convertible debentures are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock immediately at the option of the holder or at our discretion at any time after december   and prior to maturity at december  the debentures bear interest at the rate of payable quarterly 
the chairman of the board of directors and related parties contributed million to the completion of the convertible debentures 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of long term debt exposure as of december  are as follows carrying amount payments later years fair value line of credit interest rate term loan interest rate industry development bond interest rate subordinated debt foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for of our total revenue in international sales are made primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in united states dollars or the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in united states dollars 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the realized effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in resulted in a  loss 
as of december   we had investments in foreign operations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed in foreign currency when subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency produces an immaterial change in our balance sheet as of december
