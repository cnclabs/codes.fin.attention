the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes that appear beginning on page overview we develop and market a family of computer nearline storage systems that use inch rewritable  magneto optical disks  dvd and cd rom disks 
in july  we acquired nsm storage gmbh for  shares of common stock and  in cash 
we also agreed to severance payments of  to each of the two managing directors and principal shareholders of nsm and had acquisition related costs of approximately  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and as a result our historical results of operations do not include the results of operations of nsm prior to july  as a result of the acquisition of nsm  at december   we have goodwill and intangible assets of  net of associated amortization of  and a write off of acquired in process research and development of  goodwill that has an indefinite life is not being amortized 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of a four to six year period 
such intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
at december   we do not consider goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired 
the purchase price was allocated as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary method used in valuing the identified intangibles acquired 
expected cash flows were discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward to reflect additional inherent risks 
because the in process research and development had not reached the stage of technological feasibility at the acquisition date and had no alternative future use  the amount allocated of  was immediately charged to operations 
the amounts allocated to core technology  developed technology  trade name and patents are being amortized over an estimated useful life of four to six years 
the excess amount of the purchase price over the fair market value of the identified nets assets acquired was accounted for as goodwill 
goodwill with an indefinite useful live is not amortized but will be tested for impairment annually 
because of the significance of the acquisition of nsm  we do not believe the analysis of our historical financial conditions and results of operations set forth below are indicative  nor should they be relied upon as an indicator  of our future performance 
results of operations net sales 
we had net sales of  in   in and  in approximately of the increase in was due to our acquisition of nsm 
in addition  we had higher unit sales and a higher sales price per unit which resulted in sales of units with a larger number of media slots 
these increases resulted from increases in media sales and service revenue 
the decrease in net sales in as compared to was due in part to one of our major customers changing their focus from selling integrated storage solutions  which included the disc product line as a major component  to software only sales 
in addition  although unit sales in remained relatively flat as compared to  our average selling price decreased due to a shift in the product mix towards our lower priced units 
also  the units sold in generally had fewer media slots  and our revenue from the sale of media decreased 
the general sales cycles for distribution of our products are similar to those of most businesses selling products designed for use as part of large systems  and range from three to six months for value added resellers var and small system integrators and from one to two years for original equipment manufacturers oem  product integrators and large system integrators 
because our products are part of large systems  the sales cycles of our products vary significantly and are difficult to predict for any particular transaction 
the long and often unpredictable sales cycles of our products complicate forecasting for operational planning and may cause net sales and operating results to vary significantly 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was approximately in  in and in the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in  is primarily due to the increase in revenue as manufacturing costs are relatively fixed 
our relatively low gross margins reflect our low sales volumes  which have resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and high costs of materials due to the inability to achieve purchasing economies of scale due to low sales volume 
if we are able to increase sales  then we expect costs of sales per unit of product will decrease because fixed manufacturing costs will be distributed over the larger sales volume  and material costs will decrease as the result of volume purchases 
however  even with product sale increases cost of sales per unit of product may not decrease significantly or at all because the magnitude of the sales increase was not sufficient or because manufacturing  materials or other costs may increase independently 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were  in   in and  in the increase in expenses in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in headcount due to our acquisition of nsm 
we believe that research and development expenses will increase in due to a full year s cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisition in july marketing and sales expenses 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  trade shows and other marketing activities 
marketing and sales expenses were  in   in and  in the increase in was primarily due to the full year s expense of headcount hired throughout fiscal and the increase in headcount as a result of the acquisition of nsm 
expenses increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in head count 
we believe that in marketing and sales expenses will increase due to the cost of personnel added as a result of our acquisition in july general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs and legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in headcount as a result of the acquisition of nsm and an increase in professional fees 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase moderately during due to the increase in headcount as a result of our acquisition in july amortization 
amortization consists of the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in  the acquisition of nsm generated approximately  in identified intangibles  which is currently being amortized over periods ranging from four to six years see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization was  in we expect amortization expense to be approximately  in amortization could be affected by other acquisitions or impairment of existing identified intangible assets in future periods 
charge for in process research and development 
the charge for  in is for acquired in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of nsm storage gmbh 
this amount was expensed because the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and there was no alternative future use 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to the interest on the debt assumed from our acquisition of nsm 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  in  compared to  used in net cash used by operating activities in and primarily reflects a loss of  and  respectively  partially offset by depreciation and amortization of  in and  in net cash used in investing activities was  during  compared to  in net cash used in consisted primarily of purchases of hardware  office furniture and leasehold improvements and the direct costs of the acquisition of nsm storage gmbh 
net cash in consisted primarily of purchases of hardware 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to  provided in net cash provided in consisted primarily of  of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of  of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock offset by the repayment of  of debt 
we have a factoring agreement that allows us to borrow the lesser of  or of eligible receivables 
at december   we were not in compliance with the tangible net assets covenant of the agreement 
we have requested a waiver of the non compliance and although a waiver has not been received  borrowings have continued under the agreement 
in addition  at december   disc gmbh has revolving lines of credit totaling  and terms loans totaling  with maturities as detailed in the table below 
at december   we had a cash balance of approximately  in addition  we have a written commitment from our largest investor  mk gvd fund  to provide the necessary resources to support the company s operations through april  we believe this committed future investment  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through april  however  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the ability to sustain our operations for a significant period after april  will depend on our ability to significantly increase sales or raise significant additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us 
there is no assurance that any of these conditions will be achieved 
in particular  we expect to require increasing amounts of cash to finance our efforts to increase sales  which we plan to achieve by increasing selling efforts to large system integraters and oems  by hiring additional sales and sales support staff and by making evaluation units available 
in addition  we intend to expand our current network of resellers 
we may require cash to finance purchases of inventory to satisfy anticipated increased sales as our products achieve market acceptance 
in addition  we expect that the continued integration of our acquisition of nsm and the support of its operations will require cash as well 
if we incur greater expenditures than we anticipate in these or other matters  and we cannot raise funds at acceptable terms or at all  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of other opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
in  nsm storage  inc  a us subsidiary of disc gmbh  entered into a seven year non cancellable operating lease agreement  expiring in august  for its facilities in atlanta  georgia 
during february  nsm storage  inc relocated from atlanta to new york and entered into a noncancelable sublease to rent its atlanta facility  which also expires in august we have operating lease commitments from our facilities in milpitas  california  bingen  germany and various sales offices as described in the table below 
in addition  although we have not committed to make any material capital expenditures as of december   our budget for capital equipment expenditures for is approximately  the majority of these purchases are expected to be in the areas of process and molding tooling to reduce cost and improve producibility of our products we also have principal and interest payments due related to the debt assumed in our acquisition of nsm storage gmbh as described in the table below 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  are as follows non cancelable lines of operating term loans credit lease total and thereafter   the terms of the series c preferred stock and outstanding warrants may limit the availability of financing for us  particularly equity financing  because of the superior preferences of the series c preferred stock and the potential dilutive effect of the outstanding warrants 
holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in the amount of approximately  per year when and if declared 
we have never paid cash dividends and have no present plans to pay dividends 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in understanding our financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
subsequent to the sale of the products  we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization upgrades  enhancements or any post contract customer support 
provisions for returns  allowances and warranty are recorded at the time revenue is recognized based on the company s historical experience 
service revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the service contract 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the financial position of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the estimated net realizable value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast and demand requirements for the next twelve months 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory 
warranty our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate  based on historical experience  of the amounts necessary to repair or replace our product during the warrant period  which is generally one year 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to repair of replace our product could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
acquired intangibles our acquisition of nsm storage gmbh resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiary from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  the german mark for fiscal and the euro for periods subsequent to december   into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains or losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our shareholder s equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of our subsidiary 
the functional currency is based on management judgment and involves consideration of all economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts the majority of its transactions would be considered the functional currency 
if the subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the balance sheet 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we determined that the subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency 
accordingly  we had accumulated other comprehensive loss of  which is included within our balance sheet at december  to the extent that nsm storage gmbh has assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the euro  its functional currency  foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rate of the euro against the united states dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to significant market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates related to interest income because we are not expected to have a significant investment portfolio in fiscal in addition  we do not use derivative financial instruments of any kind 
we are exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates as our borrowings on our lines of credit have variable interest rates 
a sharp increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on interest expense 
international sales are made mostly from our german subsidiary and have typically been denominated in german marks and beginning january   are typically denominated in euro 
our german subsidiary also incurs most of its expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign subsidiary uses their local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected performance 
we plan to assess the need to enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities  primarily denominated euro 
we also plan to assess the need to periodically hedge anticipated transactions
