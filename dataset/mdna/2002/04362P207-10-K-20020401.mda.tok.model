item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or ascential s future financial performance  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with ascential s consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview ascential is a global provider of information asset management solutions 
ascential designs  develops  markets and supports enterprise data integration software products and solutions to allow our worldwide customers  which consists of mid sized and large organizations and governmental institutions  to transform vast amounts of disparate  unrefined data into reliable  reusable information assets 
ascential also offers to its customers a variety of services such as consulting  including implementation assistance and project planning and deployment  software product enhancements and support  and education 
ascential was incorporated in delaware in and  until the third quarter of  operated under the name informix corporation 
during  we consolidated our business units into two operating businesses i informix software  which operated our database software systems business  and ii ascential software  which operated our information asset management iam software and solutions business 
during the third quarter of  we completed the ibm transaction  which consisted of the sale of our database business  including the name informix  to ibm for approximately billion in cash see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the ibm transaction  we changed our name to ascential software corporation and changed the symbol under which the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market to ascl 
these changes became effective in july on november   ascential completed the acquisition of torrent systems  inc torrent for million in cash 
the torrent orchestrate product provides scalability  using parallel processing technology  to ascential s core data integration product offering  datastage 
see ascential products and services below 
on march   ascential announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire vality technology  inc vality in a transaction valued at approximately million in cash  net of proceeds from options to be exercised upon closing and cash on vality s balance sheet 
vality is a privately held company  headquartered in boston  massachusetts  which specializes in enterprise data quality management 
the transaction is expected to close in april  subject to approval of vality shareholders and other customary closing conditions 
ascential believes that the data cleansing technologies offered by vality will complement the data and meta data management capabilities of the datastage product suite and provide more comprehensive functionality to ascential s customers 
ascential is headquartered in westborough  massachusetts and has offices worldwide  supporting more than  customers in such industries as telecommunications  insurance  financial services  healthcare  media entertainment  government and retail 
ascential currently has approximately employees and will build from a revenue base of million  which was the revenue generated in by the ascential business operations including the i 
sell product  which was discontinued in the first quarter of and the media product  which ascential intends to divest  as announced in the first quarter of 
ascential products and services the datastage product suite is a leading data integration platform

at its core  the datastage suite provides enterprises with components for data integration  the portability and transformation of data from diverse sources  combined with tools for meta data integration and data quality assurance 
extending this capability  datastage allows each customer to extract data from diverse sources including legacy mainframe systems  enterprise applications such as sap  siebel  and peoplesoft  message based middleware and complex file structures such as xml and web logs 
the data is then transformed so that it may be made available to end user applications such as customer relationship management  decision support  e business  or other applications 
in addition  the web based components of datastage enable remote administration of an organization s warehouse investment  and the accessibility of an organization s business intelligence investments in analytic application tools such as those provided by business objects  hyperion and cognos 
we offer a full range of consulting  educational and support services to assist customers through all phases of a project 
based on tested methodologies  these services represent years of accumulated knowledge and experience  gained through hundreds of successful engagements in a wide range of industry and government installations 
as part of the ibm transaction  we entered into a strategic alliance with ibm  which became effective upon the closing of the sale  to jointly promote and market our iam solutions 
the ibm transaction during the third quarter of  we completed the ibm transaction  which consisted of the sale to ibm of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our database business  for approximately billion in cash 
ibm has retained million of the sale proceeds as a holdback to satisfy any indemnification obligations that might arise in respect of any representations or warranties made by us 
ibm will retain the holdback until december   except for any funds necessary to provide for any claims made prior to that date 
on july   interest began to accrue at per annum on the amount of the holdback ultimately released to us 
accrued interest on the holdback was million at december  in connection with the sale  we paid ibm million  which is equal to of certain deferred revenues of the database business for which we had received payment 
in addition  we are obligated to pay ibm million on or before march  to fund the transfer of certain employee related accruals 
as a result of the ibm transaction  we recorded a gain  after transaction costs and related charges  but excluding taxes  of million during the year ended december  the following table sets forth the components of the gain in millions year ended december  gross sale proceeds  deferred revenue adjustment employee related accrual adjustment minimum net working capital adjustment adjusted sale proceeds net assets transferred to ibm transaction costs and related charges gain resulting from the ibm transaction see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of components of the gain and other items related to the ibm transaction 
prior to the ibm transaction  we capitalized approximately million of costs that were incurred in connection with the implementation of our sap information system 
as part of the ibm transaction  ibm assumed ownership of this asset but granted us the right to copy and retain certain functionality components of the sap information system  which we intend to continue to use in our on going operations 
we used the cost recovery approach to account for the ibm transaction which resulted in our cost basis of this asset being zero 
during  we used a portion of the proceeds from the ibm transaction to fund the repurchase of million of common stock as part of our million stock repurchase program  and for the acquisition of torrent for million 
we intend to continue to apply a portion of the proceeds from the ibm transaction to fund ascential s business  including any further strategic acquisitions that we may undertake  and any continuing stock repurchase activity 
strategic realignment during the second half of  we undertook a strategic realignment to transition from five former business units into two operating businesses 
by december   we defined and allocated personnel among the management  selling  marketing  research and development and service organizations for these two operating businesses 
however  our core infrastructure groups operations  finance and administration were retained by informix software and these groups provided services to both operating businesses through the first half of  until the closing of the ibm transaction 
prior to december   we had not achieved sufficient separation of the employees and infrastructure of the two operating businesses to properly measure the results of the operations on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  although separate revenue information is disclosed for the two operating businesses on a historical basis  we do not present separate historical expense or operating income information for periods prior to december  as a result of this  our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses  as compared to  is presented on a combined basis for the two operating businesses 
our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for the ascential software operating business is based on a comparison of the results for quarters ended december  and september  we do not present a corresponding discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for informix software in  as we do not believe it to be relevant due to the ibm transaction 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations below is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods covered in this filing 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  merger and realignment activities  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in compliance with the securities and exchange commission s recent guidance  we are providing additional disclosure about these critical accounting policies and practices within the appropriate sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
charges for residual lease obligations and restoration costs for facilities abandoned as a result of the ibm transaction and our merger and realignment activities 
charges for severance and employment related costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of long term investments 
results of operations the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december    is structured to take the following events into account the ibm transaction  which was completed at the beginning of the quarter ended september  the database business  which we sold to ibm  accounted for of our revenue during the first half of the strategic realignment that we undertook during the second half of this realignment led to a transition from five former business units into the two operating businesses ascential software and informix software the database business that we sold to ibm in the ibm transaction 
as discussed above  we present separate revenue information for the two operating businesses  ascential software and informix software  on a historical basis  but we do not present separate historical expense or operating income information for periods prior to december  accordingly  revenues for ascential software and informix software operating businesses are compared to those for and however  our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for  as compared to and  is presented on a combined basis for the two operating businesses 
our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for ascential software is based on a comparison of the results for the most recent quarters ended december  and september  we do not provide a corresponding discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for informix software in due to the ibm transaction

license revenues 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by us or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
our products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including oems  distributors and value added resellers var s 
revenue from license agreements with resellers is recognized as earned by us  generally  when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all of our related obligations have been satisfied 
accordingly  amounts received from customers in advance of revenue being recognized are recorded as a liability in advances from customers in our financial statements 
advances in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively  had not been recognized as earned revenue 
during  we recognized revenue from resellers with previously recorded customer advances of million 
the million recognized included million of revenues related to licenses that were resold or utilized by the reseller and million related to contractual reductions in customer advances  which typically arise when a reseller agreement expires before the advance balance is fully utilized 
in addition  we recorded million of further reductions to the customer advances liabilities during as the net result of the transfer of the database customer advances to ibm as part of the ibm transaction  which were offset by any additional amounts we received from customers during during and  we recognized revenue of million and million  respectively  as a result of contractual reductions in customer advances 
during  we recorded million of revenue from the customer advances balance in respect of a transaction with a customer that was previously a supplier of services to informix software under a long term contract 
concurrent with the revenue transaction with this customer  we entered into an arrangement to terminate these services  pursuant to which we paid a termination fee of million 
our license transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  license transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the software industry  a disproportionate amount of our license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations in revenue will continue 
service revenues 
service revenues are comprised of maintenance  consulting and education revenues 
maintenance contracts generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally on a straight line basis when all revenue recognition requirements are met 
other service revenue  primarily training and consulting  is generally recognized at the time the service is performed and it is determined that we have fulfilled our obligations resulting from the services contract 
as described above  we have identified revenue recognition as one of our critical accounting practices 
as part of the revenue recognition process  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement in which company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
company specific objective evidence of fair value of maintenance and other services is based on our customary pricing for such maintenance and or services when sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and believe that we have sufficient company specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to maintenance services and professional services components of our license arrangements 
we sell our professional services separately on a time and materials basis and at times without a software license  and we have established company specific objective evidence on this basis 
company specific objective evidence for maintenance is determined based upon the either the renewal rates when maintenance is sold separately or the option price for annual maintenance renewals included in the underlying customer contract 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance  consulting  and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable at the outset of the customer arrangement  then we do not recognize revenue until the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for our license arrangements with end users  our customary practice is to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
sales to most of our resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
for certain of our database oem resellers  we accrue royalty revenue through the end of the reporting period based on reseller royalty reports or other forms of customer specific historical information 
in the absence of customer specific historical information  royalty revenue is recognized when the customer specific objective information becomes available 
any subsequent changes to previously recognized royalty revenues are reflected in the period when the updated information was received from the reseller 
prior to the ibm transaction  the amount of accrued royalty revenue averaged million at the end of each quarter in subsequent to the ibm transaction  the amount of accrued royalty revenue has been insignificant 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon the shipment of physical product  provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  or upon online availability of product to the customer 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
in the case of arrangements with resellers  revenue is generally recognized upon sell through 
evidence of sell through may take a variety of forms  including the following purchase order identifying an end user customer  usually in the ship to location  a copy of the purchase order or contract between reseller and end user  a royalty report  sell through report or other documented  objective evidence that indicates that the reseller does not have product in inventory  such as ending inventory reports 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider a fee fixed only if it is required to be paid at a set amount  it is not subject to refund or adjustment and payments are due on a known or fixed schedule 
we generally consider arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed and determinable  we recognize revenue as payments become due from the customer 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
prior to the ibm transaction  we frequently sold to customers for whom we had a history of successful collection 
subsequent to the ibm transaction  we have a larger proportion of new customers as part of our business 
new customers were and are still subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
functionality of the software 
our professional services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these professional services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately and independently from professional services  which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis 
we generally recognize revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
if consulting services are essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the license revenue and the consulting service revenue are recognized under either the percentage of completion or the completed contract method of contract accounting 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
our arrangements do not generally provide for a right of return  and historically product returns have not been significant 
we provide for sales return allowances on an estimated basis 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated statement of financial position or results of operation 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized that generally result from deferred maintenance and support  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements under sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized upon delivery of our product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
accounts receivable include amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
ascential software revenues license revenues years ended december   and the following table compares the license revenues for the ascential software product lines for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december data integration content management isell total license revenues license revenues decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in during the first quarter of  we discontinued the e commerce solution i 
sell 
during the first quarter of  we announced a decision to seek to divest our content management business  which primarily consisted of the media product 
license revenues for our continuing data integration products  which primarily consists of the datastage product line  increased to million in and decreased to million in from million in we experienced a slowing of license revenue growth during the second half of we believe this was due in part to certain customers and potential customers deferring spending on information technology as a result of the general economic downturn 
during  we entered into agreements with hewlett packard  ibm  business objects and sap that will allow these companies to resell certain of our products 
these arrangements began to generate revenue in the fourth quarter of as a result of these and other reseller agreements  we expect there will be a shift in our distribution model from one that is primarily based on a direct sales force to a more balanced model with an increased amount of indirect or reseller influenced business 
service revenues years ended december   and service revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in service revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues increased to million in and to million in from million in our maintenance revenues are increasing as we continue to build our installed customer base 
we expect that maintenance revenue growth will flatten slightly in future periods until maintenance on the discontinued i 
sell and content management products is replaced by maintenance revenue from our ongoing product offerings 
consulting and education revenues decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in these changes in consulting and education revenues are primarily a result of license revenues during the same periods  as consulting and education revenues have historically been driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenues 
informix software revenues due to the ibm transaction  we separately discuss the revenue of informix software for the first and second halves of compared to the corresponding periods in we then separately discuss the revenue of informix software for compared to informix software revenues for years ended december  and the following table compares the revenues for the informix software for the six month periods ended june  and  respectively  together with the six month periods ended december  and  respectively  and the years ended december  and  respectively in millions six months ended six months ended years ended june  december  december  informix software license revenues service revenues maintenance revenues consulting and education revenues total service revenues total revenues informix software license and service revenues six months ended december  and license revenues of million and service revenues of million for the six months ended december  arose from the database operations during july for the nine remaining countries in which our database operations were not terminated as part of the ibm transaction until august  the phase countries 
for the corresponding six month period ended december   license and service revenues for informix software were million and million  respectively 
license revenues six months ended june  and license revenues decreased to million for the six months ended june  from million for the same period in the decline was primarily a result of a decrease in license revenues from the traditional client server products of the database business and also from a decrease in large enterprise transactions 
these trends resulted from our being less successful in attracting significant new database customers and in securing additional business from our existing database customers 
our principal competitors in the database business  oracle  ibm and microsoft  were much larger  much better financed  and continued to invest substantially in their database businesses 
strategic partners in the database business including the major enterprise software application providers therefore promoted our competitors products more than they promoted our database products 
as a result  we were not successful in attracting significant new database customers 
in addition  most of our database customers who had invested in our traditional client server and tools products were in the process of replacing those products and purchasing newer products 
because of our competitive position described above  many of our database customers chose to purchase newer database products from our competitors 
we also believe that the prevailing economic slowdown had led to a deferral by some existing customers and potential customers of their decisions to enter into large enterprise transactions 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we believe the impending closing of the ibm transaction may have impaired our ability to close certain transactions 
service revenues six months ended june  and service revenues for the six months ended june  decreased to million from million for the same period in service revenues accounted for and of total revenues during the first half of and  respectively 
the decrease in service revenues in was attributable primarily to a decline in consulting revenue in our database business 
the increase in service revenues  as a percentage of total revenues in  was attributable primarily to the decline in the license revenue of our database business 
maintenance revenues decreased to million for the six months ended june  from million for the same period in the decrease in maintenance revenues in was attributable primarily to our inability to maintain maintenance revenue levels from our installed base in a climate of decreasing license revenues 
consulting and education revenues for the six months ended june  decreased to million from for the same period in the decrease in consulting and education revenues in was primarily due to the decline in license revenues experienced during the first half of  as consulting and education revenues are typically driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenues 
informix software revenues for the years ended december  and license revenues 
license revenues for decreased to million from million in the decrease in license revenues was due in large part to a significant decline in revenues from our traditional client server and tools products which we referred to as classic products and our enterprise database servers 
we believe that this decline was attributable to slower market demand for our classic products in the post yk environment and the inability of our sales and field marketing organizations to effectively market and sell our products due to a number of factors  including attrition and turnover in our sales and marketing organization  the announcement during the third quarter of of our corporate restructuring and reorganization  and delays encountered in integrating certain operations and products of ardent software  inc ardent  which we acquired in  into our sales  product marketing and general operations 
service revenues 
service revenues decreased to million in from million in service revenues accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
maintenance revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenues was attributable primarily to the renewal of maintenance contracts and our growing installed customer base 
during  consulting and education revenues decreased to million from million primarily due to the decline in license revenues experienced in as consulting and education revenues have historically been driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenues

costs and expenses ascential software corporation the following table compares the costs and expenses for ascential software corporation as the combined total of informix software and ascential software for the six month periods ended june  and  respectively  together with the six month periods ended december  and  respectively  and the years ended december   and  respectively in millions six months ended six months ended june  december  years ended december  cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of acquired research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses  costs and expenses ascential combined total of informix software and ascential software six months ended june  and  and the years ended december  and cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of manufacturing personnel costs  third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs  any write offs of previously capitalized software and amortization of acquired developed technology 
during the six months ended june   cost of software decreased to million from million from the same period in the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized software amortization as certain database products became fully amortized during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in third party royalties associated with increased license revenue from certain ascential product offerings 
cost of software distribution increased slightly to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  despite a decrease in license revenues by during this increase was primarily due to an increase in third party royalties associated with increased license revenue from certain ascential software product offerings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized software amortization as certain database products became fully amortized during and a decrease in manufacturing costs as we realized efficiencies due to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training personnel expenses 
cost of services decreased to million for the six months ended june  when compared to the corresponding period in service margins remained fairly consistent at during the six month periods ended june  and the absolute dollar decrease in cost of services in was primarily due to cost containment actions that included headcount reductions as a result of the strategic realignment in the second half of cost of services decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  and service margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  the decrease in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net service revenues is primarily due to cost containment actions that included headcount reductions as a result of the realignment and synergies realized from the ardent acquisition 
the increase in service margins experienced during was also due to the mix of service offerings  as there was a lower proportion of consulting and training revenue in  which generate significantly lower margins than maintenance 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing and communications programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the six months ended june  when compared to the same period in the decrease in was due primarily to a reduction in headcount and related overhead costs  as we have reduced our cost profile in line with the reduction in revenue that we are experiencing 
this cost reduction resulted from the realignment activities that we undertook during the second half of the decrease was also attributable to a significant reduction in advertising expenditures compared to the corresponding period in sales and marketing expense declined as a percentage of revenue to as compared to in the corresponding period in sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to increased marketing costs for advertising and marketing programs focused on promoting our internet based electronic commerce and business intelligence products and solutions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project consulting and related overhead costs for product development 
research and development expenses for the six month periods ended june  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period in as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses have remained fairly consistent at due to the realization of cost containment efforts employed during  which included headcount and overhead reductions resulting from the realignment in research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  but as a percentage of net revenues such expenses remained consistent at for both and due to the realization of cost containment efforts employed during  which included headcount reductions resulting from the realignment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the six month periods ended june  when compared to the same period in the increase in was caused by increased bad debt and litigation related expenses offset by a decrease in employee related costs 
bad debt expense was million during the six month period ended june   as a result of increased reserves against defaults by technology start up companies and other companies experiencing the downturn in the general economic environment and also as a result of the reserves required due to the discontinuation of our i 
sell product during the first quarter of litigation related expenses increased to million in the six month period ended june  primarily as a result of the charge that was recognized during the period in connection with the tentative settlement of the actions filed against the unidata operations in asia 
we assumed these obligations as part of the merger with ardent 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the six month period ended june   general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue to compared to for the corresponding period in during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses experienced during was caused by increased bad debt and legal expenses offset by a decrease in employee related costs 
bad debt expense increased approximately million as a result of increased reserves against defaults by technology start up companies  write offs of certain receivables acquired in the merger with ardent and reserves related to several eastern european government entities where political changes made collection no longer probable 
the increase in legal expenses was related primarily to a million reserve with respect to the unidata lawsuit and million paid to cincom systems  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed above  we believe that the recording of the allowance for doubtful accounts is one of our critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivables and make estimates of any allowances required in respect of doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the size of the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain an unallocated reserve for all invoices that are not specifically reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  write off of acquired research and development 
in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of incomplete technologies acquired by us for our own development efforts 
the write off of acquired research and development in connection with the torrent acquisition in is discussed below see costs and expenses ascential software write off of acquired research and development 
in connection with ardent s acquisition of prism in april  ardent recorded a charge of approximately million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development expense that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with the assumptions used at the time of the prism acquisition 
the assumptions primarily consisted of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products had entered the market 
merger  realignment and other charges 
during  we recorded million of merger  realignment and other charges 
the following table summarizes the components of these charges  as separated between charges that relate to the ongoing ascential software business and those that relate to the database business sold in the ibm transaction in millions year ended december  ascential database software business total severance and employment related costs third quarter realignment strategic realignment total severance and employment related charges facilities and equipment costs ibm transaction strategic realignment other total facilities and equipment charges write off of abandoned technology costs to exit database commitments professional fees and other total merger  realignment and other charges the merger  realignment and other charges recorded during are described below 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these items 
merger  realignment and other charges year ended december  we have identified the recording of charges related to the ibm transaction and our merger  realignment and other activities as one of our critical accounting policies 
management s judgment and estimates are required in determining the amount and classification of these charges 
we have recorded charges for facilities costs related to our merger  realignment and other activities in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these facilities costs relate to residual lease obligations and restoration costs for facilities that we have permanently vacated or planned to permanently vacate at december  we have recorded charges for severance and employment related costs related to the ibm transaction or our merger  realignment and other activities in accordance with either eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring or statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits 
we do not accrue for severance costs related to future terminations or a reduction in force that are recognized in accordance with sfas no 
because the costs are not estimable 
ascential software during the third quarter of  we approved plans to realign the business operations of ascential software 
this included a worldwide workforce reduction  which was initiated in the third quarter of  of approximately sales and marketing employees  general and administrative employees  research and development employees and professional services and manufacturing employees 
as a result of this reduction in workforce  we recorded million of charges for severance and employment related costs during the million charge for the write off of abandoned technology relates to the idecide product  which was discontinued as a result of the sale of the database business 
database business in connection with the ibm transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a million charge during for facilities and equipment costs related to facilities of the database business that were not required by either ibm or the ascential business operations 
this charge is comprised of a charge for the residual lease obligations and restoration costs and a write off related to leasehold improvements and other fixed assets at these abandoned facilities 
as a result of the strategic realignment and prior merger and realignment activities  we also recorded charges of million for severance and employment related costs  million for facilities and equipment costs  million to complete the exit from a commitment related to the database business and million for ongoing professional fees related to the realignment 
merger  realignment and other charges years ended december  and during the six month period ended december   we recorded a charge of million principally to account for the actions undertaken to realign our operational structure into two separate companies and to refine our product strategy 
included in this charge was million for severance and employment related costs  million for the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  million for the closure of facilities and equipment costs  million for costs to exit various commitments and programs  million of miscellaneous other charges and a credit of approximately million for adjustments recorded in order to reduce previously accrued merger and restructuring charges primarily for a decrease in estimated facility costs related to the merger with ardent 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million associated with the acquisition of ardent 
of this amount  approximately million related to integration and transition costs incurred during the quarter ended march  also included in the million was approximately million of accrued merger and restructuring costs which consisted of the following components million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees related to the merger  million for severance and employment related costs  million for the closure of facilities and equipment costs and million for the write off of redundant technology and other duplicate costs 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with the acquisition of cloudscape 
this amount included million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees related to the merger and million for costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies  including expenditures of million for severance and related costs  million for closure of facilities and million for the write off of redundant assets 
during the quarter ended june   ardent adopted a formal plan to exit the operations of o technologies  inc  which had been acquired by ardent in december  and recorded a charge of million for accrued restructuring charges 
the charge was comprised of million for asset impairment  million for severance and related costs and million for facility closings and other obligations 
as discussed above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have recorded significant charges in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as a result of the ibm transaction and our merger and realignment activities 
at december   the million of accrued merger  realignment and other charges included million in respect of estimated residual lease obligations and restoration costs for abandoned facilities 
the accrued residual lease obligations include remaining lease liabilities which are included as commitments under non cancelable operating leases in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
these accrued charges contain significant estimates related to sublease costs and income and to our ultimate restoration obligations for abandoned facilities 
we prepare these estimates with assistance from a commercial real estate broker  which we retain on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees  the sublease rates that can be achieved and the extent of any expected restoration required for abandoned properties 
these estimates are based on market information supplied by the broker s local offices  which have specific knowledge of the local commercial real estate market and the condition of the properties 
the estimates are updated by the broker and reviewed by management each quarter 
to the extent that the underlying assumptions change due to changes in the market  the ultimate charges for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
costs and expenses ascential software corporation combined total of informix software and ascential software six months ended december  and the following table presents the costs and expenses of ascential software  informix software and ascential software corporation for the six months ended december  and of ascential software corporation for the six months ended december  in millions six months ended december  december  ascential ascential ascential informix software software software software corporation corporation cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of acquired research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses as described above  our analysis of costs and expenses is presented on a combined basis for the two operating businesses for the costs and expenses for ascential software for the six months ended december  are discussed below 
see results of operations ascential software 
the costs and expenses for informix software for the six months ended december   consist primarily of expenses resulting from the database operations in nine countries where the ibm transaction did not close until august  and transitional database costs that are not expected to recur 
the million of general and administrative expenses for the six months ended december  consisted primarily of a million charge recorded in respect of the actions filed with respect to the unidata operations in asia see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of salary and related costs for transitional employees and executives of the database business that did not join ibm subsequent to the ibm transaction 
the million of merger  realignment and other charges recorded for informix software during the six months ended december  consists primarily of the million charge for facilities and equipment costs related to facilities that we no longer occupy as a result of the ibm transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

results of operations ascential software as discussed above  our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses for ascential software is based on a comparison of the results for the quarters ended december   and september   respectively 
the following table and discussion compares the results of operations of ascential software for the three months ended december  and september   respectively and the six months ended december  ascential software consolidated statements of operations six months three months ended ended december  september  december  in millions net revenues licenses services total revenues costs and expenses cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of acquired research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses operating loss operating loss includes amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles of million and million for the quarters ended december  and september   respectively 
costs and expenses ascential software cost of software 
during the quarter ended december   cost of software increased to million from million from the quarter ended september  cost of software consists primarily of amortization of previously capitalized software  which increased million  and third party royalties  which increased due to higher license revenue levels 
cost of services 
the cost of services decreased to million for the quarter ended december   from million for the quarter ended september  service margins increased to during the quarter ended december  from during the quarter ended september  cost of services decreased during the quarter ended december  as we adjusted our delivery capacity to meet lower demand levels 
service margins increased in the quarter ended december  as delivery capacity revenue levels were more aligned than in the quarter ended september  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the quarter ended december   from million for the quarter ended september  the decrease was driven by the full impact of a reduction in force to reduce headcount during the quarter ended september research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the quarter ended december  from million for the quarter ended september  as we completed our efforts to consolidate and reduce facilities and headcount in order to streamline and focus on our research and development effort to our core strategy and products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million for the quarter ended december  from million for the quarter ended september  the decrease resulted primarily from a million reduction in bad debt expense recorded in the quarter ended december  compared to the amount recorded during the quarter ended september  write off of acquired research and development 
in connection with the torrent acquisition in november  we recorded a charge of million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development costs iprd 
the value allocated to the project identified as iprd was charged to operations in the fourth quarter of at the acquisition date  torrent s major in process project was to add a new graphical user interface as well as additional features and functionality to an existing product 
this technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
at the date of the acquisition  management estimated that completion of the project would be accomplished by the end of february the initial development effort commenced in january at the acquisition date  iprd was approximately complete  based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the product 
at the date of the acquisition  the company expected to invest another million of development costs in this product 
the company currently expects to complete the project in mid and does not expect a significant change in the estimated completion costs 
the value of iprd was determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology  the market rates of return on contributory assets including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
the discount rate used for iprd was  a premium over the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the resulting net cash flows to which the discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology

v 
other income expense ascential software corporation interest income years ended december   and interest income increased to million in and increased to million in from million in the increase in  when compared to  was due to an increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances as a result of the proceeds received from the ibm transaction 
the increase in  when compared to  was due in part to the increase in interest rates experienced during as well as an increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances held during when compared to interest expense years ended december   and interest expense decreased to million for and decreased to million for from million in the decrease in  when compared to  was due primarily to a decrease in interest charges on capital lease payments 
the decrease in  when compared to  was due to a decline in the interest charges related to the line of credit which was terminated effective december   a decrease in the financing of customer accounts receivable  and a decrease in interest charges on capital lease payments 
impairment of long term investments years ended december   and we assess the valuation of our strategic equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine whether there has been a decline in the carrying amount of the investment that is other than temporary 
we have established criteria that we use in determining the following whether the value of an investment has declined below it s adjusted cost  whether the decline in value of an investment below it s adjusted cost is other than temporary  and the amount of any realized loss that should be recorded 
as a result of our periodic assessments  we realized a loss of million during for declines in value that were considered other than temporary 
there were no corresponding losses recorded in or as of december   the remaining book value of long term investments was approximately million  after certain asset disposals and impairment write downs during due to the rapid changes occurring in the business sectors in which our strategic investments operate  additional impairment charges are possible in the future 
litigation settlement expense years ended december   and during  we recorded a charge of million in connection with our entering into a memorandum of understanding regarding the settlement of the private securities and related litigation against us 
the charge consisted of million in cash and million in common stock for settlement expenses plus approximately million in legal fees required to obtain and complete the settlement 
the charge excludes approximately million of insurance proceeds  which  according to the terms of the memorandum of understanding  were contributed directly by our insurance carriers 
there were no corresponding charges in or other  net years ended december   and other  net decreased to a net other expense of million for from a net other income of million in for  other expense included approximately million of net foreign currency transaction losses offset primarily by million of excess rent on subleased facilities  a gain of approximately million on cash surrender value of life insurance policies and million of net realized gains on the sale of a long term investment 
other income increased to million for from million for for  other income included approximately million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments and approximately million of vat refunds received in china

income taxes ascential software corporation income tax expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
income tax expense in was primarily attributable to taxable gains in the united states and foreign jurisdictions resulting from the gain from the ibm transaction 
the income tax expense on the gain resulting from the ibm transaction is calculated after the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards that were previously fully reserved

in addition  in the year end financial statements  the company reclassified million of facilities and equipment costs related to the ibm transaction from the gain on sale of database business line item to the merger  realignment and other charges line item 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources ascential software corporation our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  the increase of million from million at december   was primarily the result of million in proceeds received from the ibm transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements offset by stock repurchases of million  income tax payments of million  the purchase of torrent for million and a cash payment of million in connection with the settlement of our private securities litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to invest in research and development activities as well as sales and marketing and product support for the ascential software business 
our investment in property and equipment will continue as we purchase computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support and administrative staff 
during  capital expenditures totaled million 
as of december   we did not have any significant long term debt or significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that the proceeds from the ibm transaction  together with our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
we also believe that we will have sufficient resources to fund the remaining portion of the announced million stock repurchase program and any strategic acquisitions that we may undertake  including the vality acquisition  which is expected to close in april  subject to approval of vality shareholders and other customary closing conditions 
disclosures about market rate risk market rate risk 
the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent or less from levels at december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus would have had a million and million impact on the value of these securities in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
as these contracts are not designated and effective as hedges  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are recorded in earnings to other income expense  net at the time of purchase  and changes in market value of the underlying contract are recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gains or losses in the period in which they occur 
we operate in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is relatively long  depending on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate at december  and the forward rate

factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to the ibm transaction because of the ibm transaction  we have a narrower focus of business and have lost a substantial portion of our historical license and service revenue 
our future financial results could be materially adversely affected as a result of our losing a substantial portion of our historical license and service revenue in the ibm transaction 
historically  the license and service revenue attributable to our data integration product family has represented a relatively small portion of our total revenue 
but beginning with the third quarter of  substantially all of our revenue has and will continue to be generated solely from our data integration product offerings 
moreover  we have lost the benefit of any future revenue growth that could have been generated by our continued operation of the database business 
in addition  we cannot ensure that the future revenue from our data integration product offerings will equal or exceed the historical revenue generated by the database business that we have sold to ibm 
the ibm transaction exposes us to potential contingent liabilities and we retain some pre closing liabilities of the database business 
as part of the ibm transaction  we agreed to indemnify ibm for certain representations and warranties that we have made under the terms of the ibm transaction agreements 
indemnification claims by ibm  should they be made  could materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  ibm assumed only certain current liabilities of the database business at closing 
as a result  we continue to be responsible for some liabilities of the database business  particularly contractual obligations that were not assumed by ibm 
in addition  as a result of the ibm transaction  we have permanently abandoned certain facilities used by the database business 
as at december   we have a reserve of approximately million for estimated residual obligations and restoration costs under the leases covering those database facilities that we no longer occupy 
those estimates are based in part on assumptions regarding the real estate markets in which the facilities are located 
if those assumptions are incorrect  our actual future obligations may be significantly different than the reserve we have established 
if the actual costs are significantly higher than our estimates  our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the ibm transaction  we lost  and will have to replace  much of our infrastructure 
as part of the ibm transaction  we sold to ibm  and therefore will have to replace  significant portions of our infrastructure  including financial and other business processes  product and services order administration  and information technology 
also as part of the sale to ibm  we entered into agreements with ibm to provide and purchase some of these services for a transitional period not to exceed months 
during the six months ended december   we provided to ibm and purchased from ibm transitional services amounting to million and million  respectively 
we expect the level of these services that we provide and purchase to decline significantly during the first half of if the transitional services agreements with ibm do not provide us with the services that we expect in the future  or if we are not able to establish our own infrastructure prior to the expiration of the transitional services agreements  our operations  and potentially our financial results  might be adversely affected 
in addition  we anticipate that there will be substantial costs associated with establishing our own infrastructure 
risks related to our business operations if we do not use effectively the proceeds of the sale of the database business operations  our financial results could suffer and the value of our common stock could decline 
our ability to increase stockholder value is dependent  in part  on our effective use of the cash proceeds of the sale of our database business operations to ibm 
at december   as a result of the ibm transaction and our continuing operations  we held approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we intend to use the proceeds to continue to operate our business  repurchase shares of our common stock and to finance any strategic acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that continuing to repurchase shares of our common stock will increase stockholder value 
in addition  we cannot ensure that spending the proceeds on strategic acquisitions  if any  will result in an increase in our revenues 
if we are unable to increase revenue from  and expand the market share of  our core data integration product  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
if we do not increase sales of our datastage product  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
in addition to the loss of revenue resulting from our sale of the database business  we have discontinued one product i 
sell and announced our intention to divest the intellectual property related to a second product media 
we derived approximately of our non database license revenue from these two products during as a result  our revenue is derived almost entirely from our core data integration product  datastage 
in order to increase revenues and grow our business  we must be able to increase sales of datastage and our share of the information asset management market 
we cannot ensure that our current customers will continue to purchase our datastage product offering and related services and that new customers will choose datastage over our competitors product offerings 
if the information asset management market declines or does not grow  we may sell fewer products and services and our business may be unable to sustain its current level of operations 
if the growth rates for the information asset management market decline for any reason  there will be a decrease in demand for our products and services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have invested substantial resources in developing data integration products and services to compete in this market 
the market for these products and services is evolving  and its growth depends upon a growing need to store and manage complex data and upon broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
declining demand for our products and services could threaten our ability to sustain our present level of operations and meet our expectations for future growth 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and such inability could impair our ability to sell our products 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive  diverse and is subject to rapid change 
in particular  we expect that the technology underlying our products and services will continue to change rapidly 
it is possible that our products and solutions will be rendered obsolete by technological advances 
we currently face intense competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market applications  development tools  decision support products  consulting services and or complete database driven solutions for the internet 
our principal competitors in the information asset management business include acta  eti  informatica  hummingbird and sagent 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies  evolving markets and changes in customer requirements 
competition may affect the pricing of our products or services  and changes in product mix may occur  either of which may reduce our profit margins 
existing and future competition or changes in our product or service offerings or pricing could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
in addition  a significant change in the mix of software products and services that we sell  including the mix between higher margin software and maintenance products and lower margin consulting and training  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
in addition  the pricing strategies of competitors in the software database industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the prices of their products 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results 
our quarterly and annual financial results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  if a large number of the orders that are typically booked at the end of a quarter are not booked  our net income for that quarter could be substantially reduced 
in addition  the failure to meet market expectations could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
these and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  including changes in growth rates in the software industry as a whole and in the information asset management business  the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products and services  possible delays in or failure to recognize revenue as the result of our revenue recognition process  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  the reaction of our customers and potential customers to the ibm transaction  any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business  changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors  or other factors  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales and seasonal buying patterns which tend to peak in the fourth quarter 
our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations that may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from selling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to the companies businesses or financial results 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a number of reasons  including market uncertainty about our business prospects as a result of the ibm transaction  market uncertainty about our business prospects or the prospects for the information asset management business market  revenues or results of operations that do not meet or exceed analysts and investors expectations  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  general business conditions in the software industry  the technology sector  or in the domestic or international economies and uncertainty and economic instability resulting from terrorist acts and other acts of violence or war 
our financial success depends upon our ability to maintain and leverage relationships with strategic partners 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic relationships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who are able to market our products and services effectively 
our ability to increase the sales of our products and our future success depends in part upon maintaining and increasing relationships with strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on relationships with a variety of strategic partners  including systems integrators  resellers and distributors in the united states and abroad 
our strategic partners may offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products 
if our strategic partners do not devote adequate resources for implementation of our products and services  we will incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to implement solutions for our customers 
in addition  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop these relationships 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel and attract and retain the new personnel necessary to grow our businesses  which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products  support our business operations and grow our businesses 
the competition for experienced  well qualified personnel in the software industry is intense 
our future success depends on retaining the services of key personnel in all functional areas of our company  including engineering  sales  marketing  consulting and corporate services 
for instance  we may be unable to continue to develop and support technologically advanced products and services if we fail to retain and attract highly qualified engineers  and to market and sell those products and services if we fail to retain and attract well qualified marketing and sales professionals 
we may be unable to retain key employees in all of these areas and we may not succeed in attracting new employees 
if we fail to retain  attract and motivate key employees  we may be unable to develop  market and sell new products and services  which could materially adversely affect our operating and financial results 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
despite efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as a consequence  we may incur losses in connection with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates in our pricing strategy  there would be a time lapse between any sudden or significant exchange rates movements and our implementation of a revised pricing structure 
the result is substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products are relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
we have implemented a foreign exchange hedging program consisting principally of the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
this program is intended to hedge the value of intercompany accounts receivable or intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products and solutions may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce commercially viable enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
if we do not enhance our products and services to meet these evolving needs  we will not sell as many products and services and our position in existing  emerging or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
in addition  commercial acceptance of our products and services also could be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and the media about us or our products or business  or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or by other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial financial and operational investment 
we may not be able to internally develop new products and services quickly enough to respond to market forces 
as a result  we may have to acquire technology or access to products or services through mergers and acquisitions  investments and partnering arrangements 
alternatively  we may not be able to forge partnering arrangements or strategic alliances on satisfactory terms  or at all  with the companies of our choice 
our future revenue and our ability to make investments in developing our products is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license our products and renew our service agreements 
we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  our revenue will decline 
our maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue also depends upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in software license revenue could result in lower services revenue in future quarters 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results and lengthy sales cycles for products makes revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales of software products and services have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends that materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ended december are typically higher relative to other quarters because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements and because we measure our sales incentive plans for sales personnel on a calendar year basis 
our sales cycles typically take many months to complete and vary depending on the product or service that is being sold 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
the sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through third party distributors 
the success of our international operations is dependent upon many factors that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and could affect our profitability 
international sales represent approximately to of our total revenue 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally  and therefore  our profitability  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  recessionary environments in domestic or foreign economies and increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries  and other changes in applicable foreign laws 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this would weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our business success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting proprietary rights may not be adequate  and the inability to protect intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and or financial condition 
we currently hold a number of united states patents and pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will be issued or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringements 
our ability to sell our products and services and to prevent competitors from misappropriating our proprietary technology and trade names is dependent upon protecting our intellectual property 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
we also rely on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  which include a notice informing the end user that by opening the product packaging  or in the case of a click on license by clicking on an acceptance icon and downloading the product  the end user agrees to be bound by the license agreement 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
we also have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of source code to the customer in the event the company enters bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or otherwise ceases to conduct business 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights in software to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
our inability to rely on the statutory safe harbor as a result of the settlement of the securities and exchange commission investigation could harm our business 
effective january   the securities and exchange commission  the sec and we entered into a settlement of the investigation against us 
pursuant to the settlement  we consented to the entry by the sec of an order instituting public administrative proceedings pursuant to section a of the securities act of and section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order 
pursuant to the order  we neither admitted nor denied the findings  except as to jurisdiction  contained in the order 
the order prohibits us from violating and causing any violation of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  for example by making materially false and misleading statements concerning our financial performance 
the order also prohibits us from violating or causing any violation of the provisions of the federal securities laws requiring us to file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the sec  maintain accurate accounting books and records  and maintain adequate internal accounting controls 
pursuant to the order  we are also required to cooperate in the sec s continuing investigation of other entities and persons 
in the event that we violate the order  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties 
as a consequence of the issuance of the january order  we will not  for a period of three years from the date of the issuance of the order  be able to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the federal securities laws 
the safe harbor  among other things  limits potential legal actions against us in the event a forward looking statement concerning our anticipated performance turns out to be inaccurate  unless it can be proved that  at the time the statement was made  we actually knew that the statement was false 
if we become a defendant in any private securities litigation brought under the federal securities laws  our legal position in the litigation could be materially adversely affected by our inability to rely on the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisition bids and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
this could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
the provisions include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting  certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings and a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock  and consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt and this has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirers from making unsolicited acquisition bids 
provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids for ascential 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to approximately four million shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting controls to others 
delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
we are incorporated in delaware and are subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including us  whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination would include  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving us and an interested stockholder and the sale of more than of our assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the anti takeover provisions 
we have not and do not intend to opt out of these anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
our current strategy contemplates future acquisitions  which will require us to incur substantial cost and potential benefits for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to implement our growth strategy  or that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
any potential acquisition may result in significant transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
achieving the benefits of any acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate those businesses with our business in an efficient manner 
our consolidation of operations following any acquisition may require significant attention from our management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve expected net sales  operating expenses and operating results for any acquired business 
we cannot ensure that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits  our operating performance could suffer 
on november   we completed the acquisition of torrent 
we consummated the transaction with the expectation that it will result in mutual benefits including  among other things  expanded and complementary product offerings  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of strategic personnel 
achieving the benefits of the acquisition will depend  in part  on the continued integration of our technology  operations and personnel in an efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the acquisition will result in the loss of market opportunity or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our business will achieve revenues  efficiencies or synergies or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings for the combined company in any future period 
on march   we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire vality 
the transaction is expected to close in april  subject to approval of vality shareholders and customary closing conditions 
we cannot assure you that this acquisition will close or that it will achieve any of the intended benefits 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the technology  operations and personnel of vality into our business in a timely and efficient manner  or that the diversion of our management s time and attention will not impair our future results 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively disrupt and negatively impact our operations 
we are unable to predict whether there will be future terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses  or against other countries or businesses located in those countries 
these attacks may directly impact our physical facilities and those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make the travel of our employees more difficult and expensive and ultimately may affect our sales 
also  as a result of terrorism  the united states may enter into an armed conflict that could have a further impact on our sales and our ability to deliver product to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business generated in those regions 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business
