in the fourth quarter  a decision was made to abandon the ion initiative and restructure operations resulting in a billion charge 
these actions were taken to respond to the unprecedented changes in the industry in an effort to better focus on enterprise data and internet services and aggressively manage costs 
sprint expects continued downward pressure on revenues in due to the economy and price competition 
some year over year improvement in operating results is expected from the elimination of ion related costs and other cost reduction efforts 
further improvements in operations are largely dependent on the timing and extent of the economic recovery and the degree of growth achieved in the enterprise data and internet services markets 
net operating revenues net operating revenues decreased in and increased in minute growth of in and in  driven in part by the increase in business minutes sold to the pcs group  was more than offset by a highly competitive pricing environment  as well as the current economic downturn

costs of services and products increased in and in interconnection costs increased in and remained flat in the increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in call volumes 
reductions in per minute international access costs as well as domestic access costs offset the impact of increased calling volumes in the domestic rate reductions were generally due to the fcc mandated access rate reductions that took effect in july  july  and july the access rate reductions in july included the implementation of calls 
all other costs of services and products decreased in and increased in the decrease is related to lower sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable offset by increased network costs of the long distance operation and costs associated with sprint ion

the rating agencies generally give some form of equity treatment for equity unit notes in determining debt to total capital ratios 
the sprint debt to total capital ratio was at year end versus at year end  assuming that the sprint equity unit notes are treated as equity and debt 
accordingly  the debt to total capital ratio for sprint is calculated defining debt as short term borrowings  long term debt  capital lease obligations and of the equity unit notes value 
total capital is defined as debt  plus the remaining of the equity unit notes value  redeemable preferred stock and total shareholders equity

moody s investors service and standard poor s corporate ratings currently rate sprint s long term senior unsecured debt at baa and bbb  respectively 
a downgrade of either rating may increase the cost of future borrowings 
if a downgrade of the long term senior unsecured debt triggered a commercial paper rating downgrade  access to the commercial paper market may become limited 
a ratings downgrade to below baa or bbb would result in the acceleration of at least million in debt and potentially as much as billion 
management maintains frequent communication with the rating agencies and considers a downgrade below baa or bbb to be unlikely 
in january  moody s investors service placed the baa long term ratings of sprint and sprint capital corporation under review for possible downgrade 
in february  fitch ratings downgraded sprint s senior unsecured debt and equity unit security to bbb from bbb 
after the downgrade  the rating outlook for the senior debt of both sprint and sprint capital corporation changed to stable from negative

these analyses indicate that a change in interest rates would have a million pre tax impact on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows at december  while sprint s variable rate debt is subject to earnings and cash flows impacts as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
sprint also prepared a value at risk analysis to assess the worst case impact of past market movements on sprint s long term debt portfolio 
based on that analysis  which used average interest rates from to present  sprint is confident that the fair value of outstanding debt would not increase above sprint s book value over the next six months
