item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scotts is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in the united states and europe 
we also have a presence in australia  the far east  latin america and south america 
also  in the united states  we operate the second largest residential lawn service business  scotts lawnservice r 
our operations are divided into four business segments north american consumer  scotts lawnservice r  international consumer  and global professional 
the north american consumer segment includes the lawns  gardens  growing media  ortho and canadian business groups 
in fiscal we continued the rapid expansion of our scotts lawnservice r business 
through acquisitions and internal growth  revenues increased from nearly million in fiscal to over million in fiscal we expect to do approximately million of lawn service acquisitions annually for fiscal and beyond 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  on creating consumer demand to pull products through the retail distribution channels 
in the past three years  we have spent approximately of our gross sales annually on media advertising to support and promote our products and brands 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus for the past several years  and we believe that scotts receives a significant return on these marketing expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and make additional significant investments in consumer marketing expenditures in the future to continue to drive market share and sales growth 
in fiscal we expect to increase advertising spending and our advertising to net sales ratio as we deliver a new media message for the ortho line  increase our advertising reach in europe and continue to have the largest share of voice in the lawn and garden category in north america 
our sales are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales but can create increased demand for pesticide sales 
we believe that our past acquisitions have diversified both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
our operations are also seasonal in nature 
in fiscal  net sales by quarter were   and of total year net sales  respectively 
operating losses were reported in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal while significant profits were recorded for the second and third quarters 
the sales trend in fiscal followed a somewhat different pattern than our historical experience due to retailer initiatives to reduce their investment in inventory and improve their inventory turns 
this has caused a sales shift from the second quarter to the third and fourth quarters that coincides more closely to when consumers buy our products 
net sales by quarter were   and in fiscal the trend of operating losses in the first and fourth quarters and significant operating profits in the second and third quarters continued in fiscal there has also been a shift in profitability between the second and third quarters with the third quarter now more profitable than the second 
in fiscal  restructuring and other charges of million were recorded for reductions in work force  facility closures  asset writedowns  and other related costs 
certain costs associated with this restructuring initiative  including costs related to the relocation of equipment  personnel and inventory  were not recorded as part of the restructuring costs in fiscal these costs  which totaled million  were recorded as they were incurred in fiscal as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
in fiscal we announced a major initiative to improve the operations and profitability of our european based consumer and professional businesses 
over the next three years we anticipate spending to million on various projects  approximately of which will be capital expenditures 
certain projects will result in the recognition of restructuring and other charges over the duration of this initiative 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in bramford  england 
the closure will occur in late fiscal the depreciation of fixed assets at the facility will be accelerated so that they are fully depreciated by the closure date 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal million of severance and additional pension costs related to the closure were recorded and reported as restructuring and other charges 
in fiscal  scotts adopted accounting policies that required certain amounts payable to customers or consumers related to the purchase of our products to be recorded as a reduction in net sales rather than as advertising and promotion expense eg  volume rebates and coupons 
in fiscal  scotts adopted eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
this standard requires scotts to record certain of its cooperative advertising expenditures as reductions of net sales rather than as advertising and promotion expense 
results for fiscal years and have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation method for these expenses 
in addition  in fiscal we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement eliminates the requirement to amortize indefinite lived assets and goodwill 
it also requires an initial impairment test on all indefinite lived assets as of the date of adoption of this standard and impairment tests done at least annually thereafter 
as a result of adopting the standard as of october   amortization expense for fiscal was reduced by approximately million 
we completed our impairment analysis in the second quarter of  taking into account additional guidance provided by eitf  unit of measure for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result  a pre tax impairment charge related to the value of tradenames in our german  french and united kingdom consumer businesses of million was recorded as of october  after income taxes  the net charge was million which is recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
there was no goodwill impairment as of the date of adoption 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  environmental matters  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows we have significant investments in property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the realizability of the assets that may be impacted 
at least annually we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the review for impairment of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon budgets and longer range plans 
these budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties lenders  analysts  etc 
about future business trends 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
as a result  impairment charges that possibly should have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates 
we continually assess the adequacy of our reserves for uncollectible accounts due from customers 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows or in general economic conditions could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts which could have a material impact on our operating results 
reserves for product returns are based upon historical data and current program terms and conditions with our customers 
changes in economic conditions  regulatory actions or defective products could result in actual returns being materially different than the amounts provided for in our interim or annual results of operations 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based on a variety of factors  including product changes and improvements  changes in active ingredient availability and regulatory acceptance  new product introductions and estimated future demand 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in the demand for our products or by regulatory or competitive actions 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended september   we are involved in significant environmental and legal matters which have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcomes will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against us or that we may bring against other parties are known to us at any point in time 
we accrue for the estimated costs of customer volume rebates  cooperative advertising  consumer coupons and other trade programs as the related sales occur during the year 
these accruals involve the use of estimates as to the total expected program costs and the expected sales levels 
historical results are also used to evaluate the accuracy and adequacy of amounts provided at interim dates and year end 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts paid for these trade programs will not differ from estimated amounts accrued 
however  we believe any such differences would not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
also  as described more fully in notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have not accrued the deferred contribution under the roundup r marketing agreement with monsanto or the per annum charges thereon 
we consider this method of accounting for the contribution payments to be appropriate after consideration of the likely term of the agreement  our ability to terminate the agreement without paying the deferred amounts  and the fact that approximately million of the deferred amount is never paid  even if the agreement is not terminated prior to  unless significant earnings targets are exceeded 
at september   contribution payments and related per annum charges of approximately million had been deferred under the agreement 
new accounting standards not yet effective in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement modifies and amends the accounting for restructuring activities that are currently accounted for in accordance with eitf issue liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires most charges to be recorded when they are incurred  rather than when it is identified that a cost resulting from a restructuring activity is likely to be incurred 
this statement applies to restructuring activities occurring after december  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company s restructuring costs incurred prior to the adoption of sfas no 
however the adoption of statement can be expected to impact the timing of liability recognition associated with future restructuring and exit activities 
also  in fiscal we will change our accounting for stock option grants prospectively 
grants awarded after september  will be expensed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
based on historical option grant levels  compensation expense is expected to increase by approximately million in fiscal since expensing occurs ratably over the three year vesting period of the options  the full effect of expensing option grants  assuming similar levels of option grants in each of fiscal  and and a constant option value for each of the awards  will be approximately million per year beginning in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the three years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit commission earned from marketing agreement  net advertising selling  general and administrative restructuring and other charges amortization of goodwill and other intangibles other income  net income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of change in accounting for intangible assets  net of tax net income dividends on class a convertible preferred stock income applicable to common shareholders the following table sets forth net sales by business segment for the three years ended september  millions north american consumer lawns growing media ortho gardens canada other total    scotts lawnservice r international consumer global professional consolidated    fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased nearly to  million from  million in fiscal north american consumer segment net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or from net sales for fiscal of  million 
within the north american consumer segment  compared to net sales for fiscal  lawns net sales increased over due to strong acceptance of our new summerguard product and continued strong sales of turf builder r weed control products and grass seed  growing media sales increased over due to continued strong performance of our value added line of miracle gro r potting mix and garden soil 
ortho sales were down slightly from fiscal to fiscal despite an increase in consumer purchases of certain product lines  overall ortho sales declined slightly in fiscal as we reduced national television advertising support to reassess our campaign for this line and prepare for a new campaign in fiscal gardens sales declined over  primarily due to a colder and wetter may the business peak sales month in the midwest and eastern portions of the us scotts lawnservice r revenues increased over from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in revenue reflects the growth in the business from the acquisitions completed in fiscal  new branch openings in late winter of and the growth in customers from our spring and fall marketing campaigns 
spending on acquisitions  including seller financing  increased from nearly million in fiscal to over million in fiscal due to one major acquisition  nearly one half of fiscal s acquisition spending occurred in august resulting in only a minor contribution to fiscal s revenue growth 
net sales for the international consumer segment were million in fiscal  which were million  or  lower than net sales for fiscal excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  net sales declined over million from fiscal to fiscal efforts by retailers to reduce their inventory investment and more closely time their purchases to consumer purchases contributed to the year over year sales decrease 
net sales for the global professional segment were million in fiscal  which were million  or  lower than net sales for fiscal the decline was primarily in north america where our customers  the end user growers  have been impacted by retailer initiatives to reduce inventory levels 
selling price changes were not material to net sales in fiscal or fiscal gross profit increased million in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal in north america  cost savings from our supply chain and purchasing initiatives to reduce manufacturing costs were partially offset by lower absorption of fixed costs due to lower production levels 
production levels were lowered in order to reduce north american inventory levels  which declined over million from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal other factors affecting margins were better product mix  particularly in our lawns and growing media businesses  and the increasing contribution of our rapidly growing scotts lawnservice r business which has higher margins than our other business units 
lastly  restructuring expenses included in cost of sales declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal which improved gross profit as a percentage of net sales by basis points 
the net commission earned from marketing agreement in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease from the prior year is primarily due to a million increase in the contribution payment due to monsanto to million in fiscal from million in fiscal advertising expenses in fiscal were million  a decrease of million from advertising expenses in fiscal of million 
the decrease in advertising expenses from the prior year is primarily due to efficiencies from improved media buying and lower rates and reduced media spending on the ortho line which was replaced with more in store promotional support  which is a marketing expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal the reduction is primarily due to restructuring and other charges of million in fiscal compared to only million in fiscal excluding restructuring expenses in both fiscal years  the million environmental charge in fiscal and selling  general and administrative expenses of the scotts lawnservice r business from both fiscal and results  sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal which reflects the benefits in fiscal from the cost reduction efforts undertaken in through reduction in workforce and other restructuring activities even though other costs such as litigation related legal expenses and information systems support expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal fiscal includes million of restructuring charges in costs of goods sold related to the redeployment of inventory from closed plants and warehouses and million in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the relocation of personnel for the restructuring activities initiated in fiscal under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  these costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million in restructuring charges  primarily severance and pension costs  related to the announced closure of a plant in bramford  england were recorded 
in fiscal  million of restructuring and other charges were recorded in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative costs 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles in fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal as described previously 
other income was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the gain and other income from the agreement for the cessation of peat extraction in the united kingdom of approximately million 
this transaction with english nature is more fully described in the liquidity and capital resources section 
this gain was partially offset by lower royalty income due to the phase out in of a lawn mower program at a major north american retailer and a one time insurance settlement gain in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal the increase in income from operations over the prior year is the result of lower restructuring expenses  increased gross margin from the increase in net sales  lower advertising spending  lower selling  general and administrative expenses  and the effect of the change in accounting for amortization of indefinite lived assets 
for segment reporting purposes  earnings before interest  taxes and amortization is used as the measure for income from operations operating income 
on that basis  operating income in the north american consumer segment increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal on an increase in net sales from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal gross margin improvement from supply chain cost reductions  improved mix in lawns and growing media  and reduced media spending levels offset by lower overhead absorption due to lower production levels  lower roundup commission and lower licensee royalties generated the improvement of north american consumer operating income 
scotts lawnservice s r operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the over increase in net sales driven by internal growth and acquisitions 
international consumer operating income was million for fiscal  compared to a loss of million for fiscal even though net sales declined to million from million during the periods 
income increased due to the peat transaction with english nature  lower spending on selling  general and administrative expenses  and restructuring charges which declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal global professional operating income increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal despite a slight reduction in net sales due to cost controls implemented in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from interest expense for fiscal of million 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in average borrowings as compared to the prior year due to increased profitability and lower working capital  and lower interest rates on our debt 
the weighted average cost of debt was in fiscal compared to in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal was million  compared with income tax expense for fiscal of million 
the increase in income tax expense from the prior year is the result of higher pre tax income in fiscal for the reasons noted above 
the lower estimated income tax rate for fiscal of compared to for fiscal is primarily due to effect of the elimination of amortization expense for book purpose that was not deductible for tax purposes and higher earnings in fiscal the company reported income before cumulative effect of accounting changes of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal after the charge of million million  net of tax for the impairment of tradenames in our german  french and united kingdom businesses  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million or 
per diluted share in fiscal if sfas no 
had been adopted as of the beginning of fiscal diluted earnings per share for fiscal would have been excluding impairment charges  if any  that would have been recorded upon adoption at october  diluted earnings per share in fiscal would have been per share if the impairment charge was excluded 
average diluted shares outstanding increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to option and warrant exercises  and the impact on common stock equivalents of a higher average share price in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of over fiscal sales of  million 
as discussed below  net sales increased over in the north american consumer segment  whereas  net sales declined by in the international consumer segment and global professional net sales were up 
net sales for the scotts lawnservice r segment increased in fiscal over fiscal north american consumer net sales were  million in fiscal compared to net sales of  million 
net sales in the lawns business within this segment were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal net sales of million  primarily due to the introduction of a new line of grass seed products 
net sales in the growing media business increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the continuation of the successful roll out of the value added line of miracle gro r branded garden and potting soils in the growing media business 
sales of branded soils increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net sales in the ortho business decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the weather and product availability issues due to erp system data problems 
the other sales category consists of sales under a supply agreement to the purchaser of the proturf r business in and actual sales of the proturf r business in fiscal prior to the date of sale 
selling price changes were not material to net sales in fiscal or fiscal net sales in the scotts lawnservice r business increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this growth reflects continued expansion through acquisitions and new branch openings  as well as the success of our direct marketing campaign utilizing the scotts r brand name 
international consumer net sales decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal excluding the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates  net sales for international consumer increased over compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales is primarily due to the successful sell in of a new line of fertilizer products under the substral r brand name acquired january  net sales for global professional of million for fiscal increased from fiscal net sales of million 
excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  global professional net sales increased approximately year over year 
approximately half of the increase was from professional seed sales which previously had been part of the pro turf business which was sold in may gross profit decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal excluding restructuring charges  gross profit was flat year over year 
gross profit  including restructuring charges  as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by the restructuring charges in fiscal which reduced gross profit by basis points and unfavorable product mix in the ortho and gardens businesses and increased sales of seed which has a lower margin than fertilizers and control products  offset by lower distribution costs and the favorable margin impact from increased sales of value added growing media products 
the net commission earned from the roundup r marketing agreement in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal despite worldwide earnings for the consumer roundup r business increasing by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal  the gross commission earned by scotts was flat due to the increased earnings targets and reduced commission rate schedule in the commission calculation for as compared to in addition  the net commission decreased due to the million increase in contribution expenses as specified in the agreement

selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  over similar expenses in fiscal of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from the prior year is partially due to an increase in selling expenses as a result of the change in the selling and distribution model for the north american consumer businesses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is also due to an increase in information technology expenses from the prior year as a result of the cost of many information technology resources being capitalized toward the cost of our enterprise resource planning system erp in fiscal and the increased depreciation on the new erp system in fiscal most of these information technology resources have assumed a system support function that is now being expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses associated with restructuring and other non operating expenses were million for fiscal these charges  along with the million which is included in cost of sales for the write off of obsolete inventory  were primarily associated with the closure or relocation of certain plants and administrative facilities 
included in the million charge in selling  general and administrative costs is million to write down to fair value certain property and equipment and other assets  million of facility exit costs  million of severance costs  and million in other restructuring and other costs 
the severance costs related to reduction in force initiatives and facility closures and consolidations in north america and europe covering approximately administrative  production  selling and other employees 
most severance costs were paid in fiscal with some payments extending into most other fiscal restructuring related activities and costs were completed by the end of fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the additional amortization related to the substral r acquisition in december and numerous small acquisitions by scotts lawnservice r throughout fiscal other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income was primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain legal matters in fiscal and an insurance settlement from a seed warehouse fire 
fiscal results also included losses on the sale of miscellaneous assets which did not recur in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease was the result of the restructuring and other charges and increased selling  general and administrative costs  the decline in the marketing agreement net commission and higher depreciation expense for the new erp system in north america which was fully in service for all of fiscal for segment reporting purposes  earnings before interest  taxes and amortization is used as the measure for income from operations or operating income 
on that basis  operating income in the north american consumer segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in sales offset by lower margins due to mix and higher expenses for its sales force and the new erp system 
scotts lawnservice r had income from operations in fiscal of million  compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from continued expansion through acquisitions and new branch openings 
operating income in the global professional segment declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower sales due to poor weather and higher operating costs in the international professional business  increased spending in biotechnology and new investments in branded plants initiatives 
the operating cost structure in the international professional business was addressed in the restructuring initiatives undertaken in late fiscal international consumer segment operating income declined from income of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal excluding restructuring charges  international consumer reported operating income of million 
the decline in income was due to lower sales related to poor weather in europe and higher operating costs 
the international consumer cost structure was also addressed in s restructuring initiatives 
the corporate operating loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to restructuring charges related to the domestic business 
interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal interest expense of million 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to favorable interest rates 
the average rate on our variable rate debt was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the primary driver of the change in the effective tax rate was the restructuring and other charges recorded in fiscal  which reduced pre tax income thereby increasing the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on the effective tax rate 
also  the prior year effective tax rate benefited from the elimination of tax reserves due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies 
net income was million for fiscal  or 
per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis 
common shares and equivalents used in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the increase reflects more common share equivalents due to higher average stock prices and option exercises in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the improvement in cash provided by operations was primarily from increased profitability and improved working capital driven by a reduction in inventory of over million in fiscal as compared to an increase of million in fiscal the seasonal nature of our operations generally requires cash to fund significant increases in working capital primarily inventory during the first half of the year 
receivables and payables also build substantially in the second quarter in line with increasing sales as the season begins 
these balances liquidate over the latter part of the second half of the year as the lawn and garden season winds down 
as of the end of fiscal  accounts receivable had not declined at the same pace as in the prior year because of the shift in sales to the third and fourth quarters from the second quarter in fiscal net sales were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  accounts receivable were million at september  compared to million at september  other significant changes in balance sheet accounts affecting cash provided by operating activities were the payment in of million of restructuring liabilities from the restructuring compared to a buildup of restructuring reserves in of million and increases to other liabilities  primarily pension related obligations  added million in fiscal compared to only million in fiscal deferred taxes added million to cash flows from operating activities due to tax benefits from the payment of restructuring accruals from in fiscal and additional bonus depreciation recognized for tax purposes in fiscal our pension liabilities increased dramatically in fiscal due to the decline in investment performance and interest rates

in april  our subsidiary in the united kingdom  working in conjunction with friends of the earth uk  reached agreement with english nature on the cessation of peat extraction activities at three peat bogs leased by us 
in late april  we received payments totaling million for the transfer of our interests in the properties and for the immediate cessation of all but a limited amount of peat extraction on one of the three sites 
approximately million was recorded as deferred income and will be recognized in income over the month period which began in may and coincides with the period we are allowed to complete extraction activities at the one site 
an additional million was received for peat inventory sold to english nature which will be used for restoration activities to be conducted at the various sites 
we will also receive compensation for services rendered from time to time in assisting english nature in restoration activities 
further amounts of approximately million will be payable to us upon cessation of peat extraction on the remaining site before october and the final transfer of interests in the property 
this agreement is not expected to have an impact on the company s ability to source these raw materials in the near term 
the deferred revenue recorded in this transaction is included in the change in accrued taxes and liabilities for the portion to be recognized in fiscal and in the increase in other liabilities for the portion recognizable after fiscal in the consolidated statements of cash flows

after payment of legal fees of million  the net proceeds of million were recorded as reductions in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the net proceeds are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as other cash flows from investing activities 
financing activities used cash of million for fiscal  compared to providing million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash from financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility in fiscal partially offset by the million issuance of subordinated notes in january the net proceeds of this issuance were used to pay down borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the exercises of stock options increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition to option exercises in fiscal  million warrants were exercised in exchange for the issuance of million treasury shares in a non cash transaction 
our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of billion consisting of term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
due to paydowns on our term loans  the amount available under the term loan facilities has been reduced to approximately million as of september  also  as of september   approximately million of the million revolving credit facility is committed for letters of credit  the balance of approximately million is available for use 
total debt was million as of september   a decrease of million compared with total debt at september  of million 
the decrease in debt compared to the prior year was primarily due to scheduled debt repayments on our term loans during fiscal and the repayment of all borrowings on our revolver as of september  due to significantly improved cash flow from operations 
at september  we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
the credit agreement contains covenants on interest coverage and leverage 
the credit agreement and the subordinated note indenture agreement also contain numerous negative covenants which we are also in compliance with in fiscal we expect to be in compliance with all covenants in fiscal there are no rating triggers in our credit agreement or the subordinated note indenture agreement 
total cash was million at september   an increase of million from september  due to restrictions in our debt agreements on voluntary prepayments of indebtedness  we elected not to use the cash on hand at september  to paydown indebtedness because voluntary paydowns permanently reduce the total borrowing commitment available under the credit facility 
a mandatory excess cash flow prepayment of million was paid in november based upon fiscal s results of operations and cash flows 
we did not repurchase any treasury shares in fiscal or fiscal we have not paid dividends on the common shares in the past and do not presently plan to pay dividends on the common shares 
it is presently anticipated that earnings will be retained and reinvested to support the growth of our business or to pay down indebtedness 
the payment of future dividends  if any  on common shares will be determined by the board of directors of scotts in light of conditions then existing  including our earnings  financial condition and capital requirements  restrictions in financing agreements  business conditions and other factors 
all of our off balance sheet financing is in the form of operating leases which are disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
we have no financial guarantees or other arrangements with any related parties other than our subsidiaries 
all material intercompany transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
certain transactions with executive officers are fully described and disclosed in our proxy statement 
such transactions pertain primarily to office space provided to and administrative services provided by hagedorn partnership  lp and do not exceed  per annum 
in late april  a jury awarded us payment of million for amounts owed to us by central garden pet  a former distributor 
at the same time  we were ordered to pay central garden pet million for fees and credits owed to them 
the verdict is subject to further revision by post trial motions and is also appealable 
the final outcome cannot be determined until the final judgment is entered by the court and all appeals  if any  are concluded 
we are unable to predict at this time when the determination of a final amount will occur or when  or if  we will receive final payment 
in july  the company s board of directors approved a plan designed to significantly improve the profitability of the international consumer and professional businesses 
the plan includes implementation of an sap platform throughout europe  as well as efforts to optimize operations in the united kingdom  france and germany  including the creation of a global supply chain 
we estimate that there will be a cash outlay of million  of which approximately will be capital expenditures  to implement this plan fully over by the end of fiscal a restructuring and other charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to one of the projects in the plan  the announced closure of a manufacturing plant in bramford  england 
during the first quarter of fiscal  a fork lift accident occurred at scotts plant in chino  california 
the accident resulted in the death of a scotts associate 
scotts believes that workers compensation insurance coverage is the family s exclusive remedy against scotts and therefore does not currently anticipate any action by the family against scotts 
there is some risk  however  that claims will be made by the employee s family against third parties  in which case scotts may become involved in the litigation 
scotts believes it has defenses to any attempt to add scotts as a defendant  but there can be no guarantees at this point that the defense would be successful 
as of december   we are not aware of any complaint that has been filed relating to the accident or any other action by the employee s family 
we are party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
these include  among others  proceedings based on accidents or product liability claims and alleged violations of environmental laws 
we have reviewed our pending environmental and legal proceedings  including the probable outcomes  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses  availability and limits of our insurance coverage and have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves 
we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows for contractual obligations as of september  in millions payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations fixed interest payments annual contribution payment under year term of marketing agreement total contractual cash obligations  in our opinion  cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our business groups will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking actions aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in item business environmental and regulatory considerations  item business regulatory actions and item legal proceedings 
management s outlook we are very pleased with the company s performance in fiscal we entered the year having just completed a significant restructuring and reduction in force in the fourth quarter of fiscal we set challenging goals for such as aggressive growth in sales and profitability  improved customer service from our order processing and supply chain organizations  improved cash flows from better management of working capital and significant cost savings from the restructuring and from new supply chain initiatives to cut costs 
we also faced unforeseen problems during the year such as retailer initiatives to reduce inventory levels and improve their inventory turns  and the bankruptcy of a major customer in the united states 
we were successful in because we executed well on all fronts 
scotts lawnservice r increased revenues over  while closing on more than million of acquisitions  and our supply chain organization met its cost reduction targets while reducing inventories in north america by over million and improving customer service 
increased profitability and working capital management brought free cash flow of million 
we also saw improvement in our international businesses and improved our return on invested capital 
our success in fiscal sets the stage for fiscal we are committed to the continued improvement of our international businesses 
we have embarked upon a three year plan to invest in systems and reorganize our international operations to drive profitable growth 
we have aggressive growth and acquisition goals for scotts lawnservice r 
we expect continued excellence from our supply chain organization in efficient operations  customer service and cost cutting 
we will invest in advertising and explore new distribution channels and products to leverage our strong brands and drive profitable growth in our north american businesses 
we believe fiscal will be a year of profitable growth  with continued improvement in return on invested capital and strong cash flow 
forward looking statements we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our summary annual report  our financial statements and other information booklet  in this form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of that act 
some forward looking statements that we make in our summary annual report  in our financial statements and other information booklet  in this form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under outstanding indebtedness and otherwise  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  advertising  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all 
we also cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
restrictive covenants may adversely affect us 
our credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictive covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and or our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and or the senior subordinated notes  the lenders and or noteholders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we cannot be sure that our lenders or the noteholders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 
adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
an abnormally cold spring throughout north america and or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and therefore our financial results 
our historical seasonality could impair our ability to pay obligations as they come due in addition to our operating expenses 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  more than of our net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and our borrowings peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand is insufficient to pay our obligations as they come due  including interest payments on our indebtedness  or our operating expenses  at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facility  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  growing media  herbicides and pesticides  bearing one of our brand names 
on occasion  allegations are made that some of our products have failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property 
based on reports of contamination at a third party supplier s vermiculite mine  the public may perceive that some of our products manufactured in the past using vermiculite are or may also be contaminated 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair reputation  involve us in litigation  damage our brand names and have a material adverse affect our business 
because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of  or significant decline in orders from  our top customers could adversely affect our financial results 
north american consumer net sales represent approximately of our worldwide net sales 
our top four north american retail customers together accounted for over of our north american consumer fiscal net sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  home depot  wal mart  lowe s and kmart represented approximately  and  respectively  of our fiscal north american consumer net sales 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  lowe s  kmart or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect 
we do not have long term sales agreements or other contractual assurances as to future sales to any of our major retail customers 
in addition  continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base 
to the extent such concentration continues to occur  our net sales and operating income may be increasingly sensitive to a deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments involving our relationship with  one or more customers 
kmart  one of our top customers  filed for bankruptcy relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on january  following such filing  and their successful obtaining of debtor in possession financing  we recommenced shipping products to kmart  and we intend to continue shipping products to kmart for the foreseeable future 
if kmart does not successfully emerge from its bankruptcy reorganization  our business could be adversely affected 
the highly competitive nature of the company s markets could adversely affect the ability of the company to grow or maintain revenues 
each of our segments participates in markets that are highly competitive 
many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours  and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product performance  value  brand strength  supply chain competency and advertising 
some of our competitors have significant financial resources and research departments 
the strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals  which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products without being required to pay any termination fee  we would lose a substantial source of future earnings 
if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup r products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for cause  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of this significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also be able to terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive fiscal years 
the hagedorn partnership lp beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis 
the hagedorn partnership lp beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis and has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the united states environmental protection agency us epa and  in many cases  similar state agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us epa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products  continue to be evaluated by the us epa as part of this exposure risk assessment 
it is possible that the us epa or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
for example  in june  dowagrosciences  an active ingredient registrant  voluntarily agreed to a gradual phase out of residential uses of chlorpyrifos  an active ingredient used in our lawn and garden products 
in december  the us epa reached agreement with various parties  including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon  regarding a phased withdrawal from retailers by december of residential uses of products containing diazinon  used also in our lawn and garden products 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the us epa s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products 
the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
regulations regarding the use of some pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product  that the products be used only in specified locations or that certain ingredients not be used 
users may be required to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied and may be required to notify individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure you that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed upon condition 
in some locations  we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  air and water discharges from our facilities 
in june  the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa initiated an enforcement action against us with respect to alleged surface water violations and inadequate treatment capabilities at our marysville facility and is seeking corrective action under the resource conservation recovery act 
we have met with the ohio epa and the ohio attorney general s office to negotiate an amicable resolution of these issues 
on december   an agreed judicial consent order was submitted to the union county common pleas court and was entered by the court on january  in fiscal  we made in environmental capital expenditures and incurred approximately million in other environmental expenses  compared with approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses in fiscal the adequacy of these estimated future expenditures is based on our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations and several significant assumptions that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us  and that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in ohio  that potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream 
if there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations  it could have a material impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our significant international operations make us susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany  france and the netherlands 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
in addition  our operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate our market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have various debt instruments outstanding at september  and that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we entered into the following interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates in fiscal  we had a million british pounds sterling notional amount swap to convert variable rate debt obligations denominated in british pounds sterling to a fixed rate 
the exchange rate used to convert british pounds sterling to us dollars at september  was gbp 
at september  and  six and four interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million and million  respectively  were used to hedge a portion of the term loan variable rate obligations under our credit facility 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  and for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  and the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps on us libor average rate expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps on gbp libor average rate interest rate swaps on us libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the currency of the country of origin 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of achieving our objectives or minimizing our risk exposures on these materials
