item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under the heading factors affecting future operating results and in the business section and elsewhere in this form k 
cyberonics undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
summary we were founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
clinical trials of the ncp system began with the first patient implant in november under investigational device exemption ide from fda 
we received fda approval to market the ncp system in the us in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory or resistant to antiepileptic drugs 
we were granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the ncp system in the member countries of the european union and we also have permission to sell in certain other international markets with the broader indication of refractory epilepsy and without discrimination to patient age 
in march  the ncp system was approved by nv kema  an official notified body representing the european union countries  for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients that are in a treatment resistant or treatment intolerant major depressive episode 
this ce mark approval  by definition includes the treatment of depression in patients with major depressive disorder  or so called unipolar depression  as well as patients with bipolar disorder  or manic depression 
in april   the ncp system was approved by health canada for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients that are in a treatment resistant or treatment intolerant major depressive episode 
the canadian approval is similar to ce mark european approval in that patients with unipolar depression and bipolar depression are included 
from inception through july  our primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the ncp system for the treatment of epilepsy 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities which include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and system infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the us market launch of the ncp system and the clinical research costs associated with new indications development  most notably depression 
we expect to remain unprofitable through at least fiscal as we continue our efforts to develop vagus nerve stimulation for new indications  including depression  ad  anxiety  obesity  and other disorders covered by our proprietary patent portfolio 
in march  we elected to change our fiscal year from june to a week year ending on the last friday in april of each year  effective april  accordingly  fiscal started april  and ended april  and fiscal started july  and ended april  for the period from inception through april   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
moreover  we expect to devote considerable financial resources for clinical studies in the development of new indications for the ncp system 
the clinical studies for depression are for investigational therapies that are not expected to generate significant sales prior to fda approval  which is not anticipated before mid calendar if at all 
as a result  we will continue to experience operating losses through fiscal furthermore  the timing and nature of these expenditures are contingent upon several factors outside of our control and may exceed the current expectations of securities analysts and investors 
we do not expect to be profitable before fiscal  if at all 
the company s future success is dependent upon a number of factors which include  among others  achieving market acceptance and generating sufficient sales volume  obtaining and maintaining regulatory and reimbursement approvals for its products  the possibility of competition and technological changes  developing its sales  marketing and corporate infrastructures  maintaining an uninterrupted supply of certain sole source components and materials  adding sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet future possible product demand  possible product liability or recall  and reliance on key personnel 
critical accounting policies the company considers the following accounting policies as the most critical because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and most demanding in their calls on judgement 
accounts receivable 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or that historically experienced by the company would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
cyberonics states its inventories at the lower of cost  first in  first out fifo method  or market 
cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand should differ from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals and betterments are capitalized for financial reporting purposes  the company computes depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from three to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment would result in an acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and line of credit approximate their fair values due to the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer  net of estimated returns and allowances 
the company s revenues are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to the company s policy 
a change in this policy or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred primarily at the time of enrollment and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly with changes in the timing of clinical activity 
warranty expense 
the company provides at the time of shipment for costs estimated to be incurred under its product warranties 
provisions for warranty expenses are made based upon projected product warranties 
amounts actually paid could vary subject to certain factors discussed in factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the weeks ended april  totaled million  compared to net sales of million for the weeks ended april  net sales of million for the weeks ended april  increased over fiscal by 
the growth is primarily due to increases in unit sales in the us as well as increases in average selling prices in all markets 
us net sales for the weeks ended april  were million  compared to million and million for the weeks ended april  and the months ended june   respectively 
international sales for the weeks ended april  were million compared to million and million for the weeks ended april  and the months ended june   respectively 
substantially all sales for all periods presented were for epilepsy product sales 
future increases in net sales will depend upon increased market acceptance for the ncp system and upon expanding our reimbursement from third party payers 
we cannot assure you that sales levels in subsequent periods will increase at the rates experienced in recent periods or at all 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor cost  royalties  and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
gross margin was for the weeks ended april   as compared to and for the weeks ended april  and months ended june  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal is the result of increases in average selling prices and improvement in manufacturing production efficiencies 
gross profit margin as a percent of sales decreased in fiscal due to million in obsolescence costs 
in february  the model was introduced and immediately gained acceptance with payers  patients and physicians  causing an unanticipated product preference shift away from the model as a result of the change in demand  existing inventories of the model were deemed obsolete and written off in fiscal without the additional obsolescence charges  the gross margin for the weeks ended april  would have been  or an increase of over the months ended june  we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate of of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between direct and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the ncp system selling price  applicable royalty rates  and the levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for the weeks ended april   as compared to million or of net sales for the weeks ended april  and million or of net sales for the months ended june  the increase in fiscal over prior year is primarily due to the additional marketing programs implemented during fiscal in the us and europe to expand awareness and acceptance of vns therapy for the treatment of chronic depression with psychiatrists through targeted educational initiatives and increased participation in industry marketing events 
administrative staffing levels also increased to support the growth of the organization over fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to the expansion of our sales force in late fiscal and in personnel to support overall infrastructure and business system improvements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to our product and process development  product design efforts  clinical trials programs and regulatory activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales for the weeks ended april   compared to million  or of net sales for the weeks ended april  and million  or of net sales for the months ended june  the increase is due to the additional costs associated with the depression pivotal study and other new indication pilot studies and expanded regulatory activities supporting the growth of the business 
non recurring charges 
non recurring charges were million for the weeks ended april  on september   medtronic  inc medtronic publicly announced a proposal to acquire the company for per share in value of medtronic common stock 
the company s board of directors  with the assistance of morgan stanley dean witter  the company s financial advisor  elected to remain independent to pursue its patent protected business opportunities 
on september   medtronic announced that it had withdrawn its offer 
the company incurred non recurring charges of million which includes investment banking fees to morgan stanley dean witter of million 
the company also incurred legal  accounting and consulting fees of approximately  and other related costs of  interest income 
interest income totaled million during the weeks ended april   compared to million for the weeks ended april  and million for the months ended june  we expect interest income to gradually decrease in absolute dollars in future periods  as we utilize our resources to fund future working capital requirements 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the weeks ended april   as compared to  for the weeks ended april  and  for the months ended june  interest expense has increased due to the establishment of a million credit facility in september which bears interest of the designated bank rate plus on the greater of  or the average of net balances owed by the company at the close of each day during the month and includes interest expense on capital leases for manufacturing equipment which bears interest at over a term of five years 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  totaled  during the weeks ended april   compared to  during the weeks ended april  and  for the months ended june  in all reported periods  other income expense consisted primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect other income expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
at april   we had operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
change in accounting principle 
effective july   we changed our method of computing depreciation on domestic fixed assets from the double declining method to the straight line method 
this change was implemented to better match revenues and expenses taking into account the nature of these assets and our business 
the new depreciation method was applied retroactively to all domestic assets acquired in prior years 
the cumulative prior years effect of the changes was  net of income tax of and is included in income for the fiscal year ended june  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our securities 
in february  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a private offering 
on june   we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment valued at approximately  and used in the production of the ncp system 
the capital leases bear interest of and extend through april in september we established a revolving credit facility for  with a term of three years 
the credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  documents of title  general intangibles  subsidiary stock and other collateral 
borrowings against the facility are based upon eligible accounts receivable 
the net available borrowing base at april  was  interest is payable in the amount of the designated bank rate plus on the greater of  or the average of the net balance owed by the company at the close of each day during the period 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we agreed to maintain liquidity being the aggregate of availability under the credit facility and cash equal to or greater than  and limit annual capital expenditures to  as of april   we were in violation of this loan s capital expenditure provision that was subsequently waived by the lender for the weeks ended april  an unused line of credit fee is payable at the rate of 
as of april   we had  in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
during the weeks ended april   net cash used in operating activities was approximately  accounts receivable increased  to  at april  from  at april  inventories increased  to  at april  from  at april  during the weeks ended april   we used approximately  in the purchase of property and equipment 
during the same period we received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  from maturities of marketable securities 
during the months ended april   we used approximately million of cash from operating activities 
accounts receivable and inventories decreased from million and million respectively in june to million and million respectively in april we also used approximately million to purchase capital equipment to expand manufacturing and business system capabilities 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options held by our employees and common stock acquired through the employee stock purchase plan 
during the months ended april   we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a private equity offering 
during the months ended june   we used approximately million of cash from operating activities 
accounts receivable and inventories increased from million and million respectively  in june  to million and million  respectively  in june we also used approximately million to purchase capital equipment to expand manufacturing capabilities and provide significant improvements in integrated business systems 
we received approximately million during the months ended june  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options held by our employees 
our liquidity will continue to be reduced as funds are expended to support clinical trials and related regulatory activities  epilepsy sales growth  and product and process development 
we are a party to a number of contracts pursuant to which we are paying for clinical studies for which current operating obligations payable totaled million as of april  although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities  and to enhance business infrastructure and facilities 
our current projections indicate that we have sufficient funds and cash flow resources to fund anticipated business activities through january   without additional financing 
our cash flow could  however  be adversely effected by the factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
we would consider reasonably priced additional financing which would provide funding for new indications development and unplanned or expanded clinical studies 
financing through debt or equity instruments may be available  although the availability of such financing will depend upon a number of important factors  including the strength of the us capital markets and economy  the health care and medical device segments in particular and the status of our business activities  including epilepsy sales growth and clinical and regulatory activities 
the chart below reflects our current obligations under our material contractual obligations 
capital lease total contractual line of credit obligations operating leases obligations contractual obligations less than one year     years    years   over five years   total contractual obligations     impact of new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could affect our future results 
our common stock price constantly changes 
a public market for our common stock has existed since our common stock is now traded on the nasdaq national market under their ticker symbol cybx 
the price of stock on that trading market fluctuates  and we expect that the market price of common stock will continue to fluctuate 
for instance  since april   our stock has traded from a low of to a high of per share 
the fluctuation in our stock price is caused by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  results of studies regarding the efficacy of our vns therapy treatment for other indications including depression  ad  anxiety and obesity disorders  announcements of significant contracts  acquisitions  or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of medical device companies  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and changes in the general conditions of the economy 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
these broad market fluctuations have also adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock 
we rely on only one product for our revenues and if sales of this product are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
we have only one product  the ncp system  which has been approved by fda for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we do not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the ncp system in the us for at least the next two fiscal years  if at all 
although sales of the ncp system have been increasing  we cannot assure you that sales will continue to increase at the same rate or at all 
we do not yet have the regulatory or reimbursement approvals necessary to commercialize the ncp system for the treatment of depression 
we cannot assure you that any approvals for the treatment of depression with the ncp system will be granted  nor can we assure you that even if the approval is granted  we will be successful in commercializing the ncp system for the treatment of depression 
the same uncertainty surrounds our efforts in anxiety disorders  ad applications and obesity 
our inability to commercialize successfully the ncp system for depression  obesity and other indications will severely harm our business 
we may not be able to continue to expand market acceptance of the use of the ncp system to treat epilepsy  which could cause our sales to decrease 
continued market acceptance of the ncp system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the ncp system 
while the ncp system has been used in approximately  patients through june   many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing antiepileptic drugs and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the ncp system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the ncp system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
we cannot assure you that the ncp system will continue to achieve expanded market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication 
failure of the ncp system to gain market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns therapy for the treatment of depression  ad  anxiety  obesity  or any other indications 
we are in the process of conducting studies to help us evaluate  and potentially obtain fda approval  for the use of vns therapy as a treatment for depression  ad  anxiety  obesity and other neurological disorders 
we cannot assure you that our test results will be positive or that we will receive fda approval for the use of our product for the treatment of any other indication 
even if we receive fda approval for another indication  we can provide no assurances with respect to market acceptance 
if our test results are not as we anticipate  if we receive no additional fda approvals or if alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenues will not experience the growth that we currently anticipate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the extent to which the ncp system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for the ncp system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payers  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if increased expenses were not accompanied by increased sales  our results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter would be harmed 
we may be unable to maintain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the ncp system successfully depends in part on whether third party payers  including private health care insurers  managed care plans  the us government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the ncp system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the ncp system and the related services we have in the us or internationally 
if we fail to maintain favorable coverage decisions for the ncp system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the ncp system which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
we cannot assure you that our marketing and sales efforts will succeed in promoting the ncp system to patients  health care providers or third party payers on a broad basis 
in addition  due to limited market awareness of the ncp system  we believe that continuing to expand our sales could be a lengthy and costly process requiring us to continue to educate patients  health care providers and third party payers regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the ncp system 
in certain international territories  we rely  and intend to continue to rely  upon independent distributors 
we may not be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel or foreign distributors to support our marketing and sales efforts 
our failure to successfully market and sell the ncp system or to retain our sales force would severely impair our sales and our business 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the ncp system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the ncp system if or  when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have defects and result in product recalls 
the ncp system includes a complex electronic generator device and lead device designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping problems or design defects could result in the product not delivering the therapy for which it is indicated 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse clinical reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring explantation and potential reimplantation of the ncp system which may increase risk to the patient 
any product recall could severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the ncp system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and we cannot assure you that patents will issue from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology  or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
we may have to engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the ncp system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future antiepileptic drugs will continue to be the primary competition for the ncp system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to clinically assess an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the ncp system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the ncp system in the us  we have begun and intend to continue to significantly expand the scope of our operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend upon the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business would suffer 
we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the ncp system entails the risk of product liability claims 
our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover any of these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may only be available at significantly higher premiums or not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the ncp system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the us by federal agencies  primarily fda  and by comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the ncp system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the ncp system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the us we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the ncp system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments in us government obligations  our line of credit and our fixed rate long term debt 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results 
our reported revenues  expenses and cash flows from this subsidiary are exposed to changing exchange rates 
to date there have not been material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments
