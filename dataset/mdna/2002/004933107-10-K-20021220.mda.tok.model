item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading designer and marketer of licensed motorsports products related to nascar  including die cast scaled replicas of motorsports vehicles  apparel and memorabilia 
we currently have exclusive license agreements with many of the most recognized names in nascar 
we also design and sell products relating to other motorsports  including racing sanctioned by the nhra  formula one  the irl and the world of outlaws 
in germany  we merchandise formula one and high end auto manufacturer die cast replica vehicles 
we work closely with drivers  team owners  track operators and sponsors to design and merchandise our products 
third parties manufacture all of the replica motorsports vehicles and most apparel and memorabilia  generally utilizing our designs  tools and dies 
we retain ownership and control over designs and tooling and have close working relationships with our third party manufacturers to help assure product quality 
we have structured our operations to enable us to respond to challenging business conditions and to service higher levels of sales with limited increases in operating expenses and capital investments 
the principal elements of this operating structure include the following we have the ability to exert a high degree of control over product pricing 
manufacturing costs are largely fixed as a percentage of sales due to outsourcing under fixed price contracts 
royalties are paid generally as a percentage of sales 
due to our agreements with distributors and qvc  incremental volume does not proportionately increase our operating expenses 
research and development is limited to basic design and engineering 
capital expenditures are principally limited to tooling for die cast 
functions such as manufacturing and others outside of our core skills are generally outsourced 
revenue our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of our licensed motorsports products 
the popularity and performance of drivers and teams under license  the popularity of motorsports in general and nascar in particular  the general demand for licensed sports merchandise and our ability to design  produce  and distribute our products in a timely manner influence the level of our net sales 

table of contents we distribute our products through a broad range of channels  including a network of wholesale distributors  leading mass market retailers  mobile trackside stores  qvc  and our collectors club catalog 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title passes to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
most distributor sales are recognized when product is shipped to a distributor because title to the product passes to the distributors at shipment 
sales to mass market retailers are recognized when title to product passes to the retailer  either at time of shipment to the retailer or receipt by the retailer 
under terms of our consignment agreement with qvc  collectors club catalog sales are recognized when qvc ships product to the consumer 
we recognize trackside sales when the consumer purchases product at the point of sale 
a portion of the product sold through television programming is consignment product  for which sales are recognized when qvc ships the product to the consumer 
internet and other sales are generally recognized when delivered to the consumer 
cost of sales cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  royalty payments to licensors  depreciation of tooling and dies  and freight charges 
substantial portions of our die cast products are manufactured under an exclusive agreement with early light  a manufacturer in china 
we obtain substantially all of our apparel and memorabilia products on a purchase order basis from several third party manufacturers and suppliers 
due to the variable nature of most of the components of our cost of sales  our gross margin generally does not fluctuate significantly 
however  certain factors do affect our gross margin  including the following product mix  our ability to control product pricing without discounting  the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales  the type of freight charges  and additional charges related to lower than minimum order quantities and cancellation of specific purchase orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  advertising and promotion  rent and other facility costs  and depreciation and amortization 
the majority of these costs are fixed and  as a result  incremental sales volume generally results in a decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
seasonality because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters are historically characterized by higher sales 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  royalties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
royalties our license agreements generally require payments of royalties to drivers  sponsors  teams  and other parties on a calendar year basis 
royalties payable are recognized as costs of sales when the related sale is recognized 
guarantees advanced under license agreements are carried as prepaid royalties until earned by the third party  or considered to be unrecoverable 
we evaluate prepaid royalties regularly and expense prepaids to cost of sales to the extent projected to be unrecoverable through sales 
goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at least annually  in accordance with sfas for goodwill  we first compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  additional tests would be used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we use a present value technique to measure reporting unit fair value 
if the carrying amount of any other intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
we have not recognized any impairment losses to date 
if events occur and circumstances change  causing the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount  impairment losses may be recognized in the future 

table of contents deferred tax assets we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing treatment of items dictated by generally accepted accounting principles versus us and german tax laws 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we were to believe the recovery was less than likely  we would establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in which such a determination was made 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb no 

common stock options issued under our plans generally do not result in compensation expense because the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain expense and revenue items

special charges in  we recorded charges of million arising from the decision to abandon our internet strategy  relating to goracing 
com 
the goracing 
com network at that time consisted of various motorsports related  e commerce enabled web sites that we developed  operated and maintained 
the charges include provision for the write off of goodwill  endorsements  sponsorship commitments  employee severance and termination costs  and the withdrawal of the initial public offering of goracing 
com 
the charges are reflected in the financial statements as follows in millions 
table of contents selling  general and administrative non cash charges accounts receivable and prepaids initial public offering withdrawal other cash charges professional fees employee severance and termination costs endorsements and sponsorships selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and trademark amortization of licenses we completely utilized the accruals for the above cash charges of million with cash payments of million in and million in as a result of the decision to abandon our internet strategy and in response to demand changes  we evaluated our operations and concluded it was necessary to reorganize the company and refocus on our core strengths 
consequently  in addition to the goracing 
com charges  the financial statements include charges of million for restructuring and other costs 
anticipated sponsorships and driver and marketing programs did not materialize as anticipated  contributing to million in inventory write downs 
vendor discounts totaling million were anticipated but not received due to lower than anticipated volumes 
a change in the estimated useful lives of tooling equipment and identification of obsolete items caused tooling write downs and amortization totaling million 
we decided to concentrate future production on core drivers and core programs contributing to write downs of prepaid royalties and sponsorship fees of million 
revised estimates of the collectibility of certain customer account balances indicated million of additional receivable reserve requirements 
we determined the goodwill related to the die cast helmet product line was worthless resulting in a million impairment 
these charges are reflected in the financial statements as follows in millions cost of sales inventory write downs vendor discounts depreciation tooling write down tooling amortization prepaid royalty and sponsorship fees total cost of sales selling  general and administrative accounts receivable other assets total selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and trademark minority interests and other  net other equity investments 
table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  net sales increased to million for  from million in the prior year 
sales increased in both die cast and apparel distribution channels 
domestic die cast sales increased from the prior year while foreign die cast sales increased 
sales of die cast products to mass retailers under the winner s circle brand accounted for of the increase in domestic die cast sales 
the remaining increase in domestic die cast sales reflects a continuation of the increase in consumer demand  which began in the second quarter of domestic apparel and memorabilia segment sales  exclusive of trackside  increased million  or  from the prior year 
revenues from businesses acquired in accounted for of this increase 
the remaining increase in revenues reflects increased demand from both wholesale and mass retail channels 
trackside sales decreased to million from million 
trackside revenues in reflected substantial sales of dale earnhardt sr 
product 
revenues for included million from goodsports  which was closed effective september  gross profit improved to of sales in from in domestic die cast margins improved as the depreciation of tooling and dies has declined as a percentage of revenues 
in addition  segments generally benefited from stable costs and increased volume 
effective september   we also closed the goodsports foreign apparel operation  which had a lower margin than the corporate average 
these improvements in gross margin were partially offset by the negative impacts of higher margin apparel sales being a smaller component of total sales this year than last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales in  reflecting strong expense controls and the leverage we obtain from increased revenues due to our economic model in which there is only limited variability in each seasonal quarter 
goodwill and trademark amortization ceased effective october   with the adoption of sfas goodwill and trademark amortization in was million  or of sales 
interest expense of million in  was million lower than interest expense for the prior year as a result of the convertible subordinated note repurchases and other long term debt reductions

domestic die cast sales increased from the prior year to million and foreign die cast sales increased from the prior year to million 
domestic apparel sales  exclusive of trackside  increased from the prior year to million and foreign apparel sales increased from the prior year to million 
trackside sales increased to million 
in the second quarter  in connection with the start of the nascar racing season  consumer demand increased significantly 
demand was driven in part by increased consumer awareness as a result of improved nascar television coverage 
due to the shorter production lead time  sales in domestic apparel operations strengthened after the first quarter 
however  because of the day lead time required to produce and ship die cast replicas  product was not available for shipment to customers until late in the third quarter 
as a result  domestic die cast sales growth was lower than apparel sales growth 
gross profit improved to million in from million in the prior year period included million of special charges 
the gross profit percentage improved to of sales from of sales  after considering the effect of special charges 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales resulted from reduced freight  product  and production costs and the leverage attained from higher die cast production quantities with relatively fixed tooling and die depreciation costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the prior year 
the prior year included million of special charges 
selling  general and administrative  excluding the special charges  represented of sales in and of sales in the decrease as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from costs eliminated as a result of the outsourcing agreement with qvc and cost reductions realized from management and restructuring changes made in the third and fourth quarters of we also benefited from the full year effect of headcount reductions in amortization of goodwill  trademark  licenses  and other intangibles decreased to million for from million in the prior year 
the prior year period included million of special charges 
the million decrease  net of the special charge  is related to the elimination of goodwill and related amortization from the sale of fantasy sports and the reductions in amortization expense as a result of the impairment write offs of goodwill and licenses recorded in the third and fourth quarters of interest expense for was million lower than the prior year 
the reduction is primarily the result of the convertible subordinated note repurchases discussed further in liquidity and capital resources and other long term debt and liabilities reductions since last year

selling  general  and administrative expenses were million during the fourth quarter of  or of sales 
excluding special charges during  such expenses were million  or of sales 
the selling  general and administrative expenses reflected a reduction in sales without a corresponding reduction in such costs 
adjusted to reflect adoption of eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  in the quarter ended september  our revenue and operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of seasonality factors related to the commencement february and completion november of the nascar race season

the increase in days sales outstanding reflects the change in our business towards mass market retailers  which generally have longer payment terms  and our acquisitions 
during  approximately of our sales to mass market retailers were supported by letters of credit 
days in inventory  calculated on quarterly cost of sales  increased to days as of september   compared to days as of september  growth in inventories arose from inventories of acquired companies that were not included a year ago  growth in mass apparel retail inventories staged and awaiting shipment in early october  and from the inventories that were on ships at september   due to the west coast dock problems

the million reduction in available line of credit reduces commitment fees payable 
we have never borrowed under the agreement originally dated september 
we believe that the line of credit reduction was warranted by this fact and current cash flow and cash positions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
we do not currently use and we have not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
at september   we had million outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes at an interest rate of  and approximately million of debt outstanding at various rates and terms  principally under promissory notes and capital leases 
interest rates on these credit instruments are fixed and comparable to current market rates 
the functional currency for our foreign operation is the euro 
as such  changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our future earnings 
given the level of income we currently derive from our foreign operations  we consider this exposure to be minimal 
a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on our future earnings 
additionally  at september   we had million in intercompany advances denominated in euros for which the exchange rate gain or loss is charged to results of operations
