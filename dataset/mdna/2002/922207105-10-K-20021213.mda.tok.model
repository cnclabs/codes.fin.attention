item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of  any statements using the terms believes  anticipates  expects  plans or similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
there are a number of important factors that could cause varian semiconductor s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this report and presented by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause varian semiconductor s financial results to differ are under the heading risk factors below 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and accounting estimates varian semiconductor s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon varian semiconductor s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires varian semiconductor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continual basis  varian semiconductor evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  post retirement benefits  contingencies  and functional currencies 
varian semiconductor operates in a highly cyclical and competitive industry that is influenced by a variety of diverse factors including  but not limited to  technological advances  product life cycles  customer and supplier lead times  and macroeconomic and geographic economic trends 
estimating product demand beyond a relatively short forecasting horizon is difficult and prone to forecasting error due to the cyclical nature and inherent lack of visibility in the industry 
varian semiconductor bases its estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also the factors discussed below under the section titled risk factors 
varian semiconductor believes that the following sets forth the critical accounting policies used by varian semiconductor in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue includes established products  new products and spare parts 
varian semiconductor recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
for established and new products  a portion of the total purchase price is typically not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
for established products  the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount due upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery 
the amount deferred is recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
for new products  revenue allocated to the equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized upon the later of delivery or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 

table of contents products are classified as established products if post delivery acceptance provisions and the installation process have been determined to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory due to the fact that the acceptance provisions are generally a replication of pre shipment procedures and there is an established history of installations 
the majority of products are designed and manufactured to meet contractual customer specifications 
to ensure customer specifications are satisfied  the systems are tested at varian semiconductor s manufacturing facility prior to shipment 
to the extent that customers conditions can not be replicated in varian semiconductor s facilities or if there is not a demonstrated history of meeting newer customer specifications  then the product is treated as new for revenue recognition purposes 
service revenue includes revenue from maintenance and service contracts  paid service and installation services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation 
royalty and license revenue is recognized when contractual obligations are met  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
when fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recorded when payments become due 
varian semiconductor s transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to all elements  except systems  based upon the fair market value of those elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon hourly rates at the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of all other elements is based upon the price charged when these amounts are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation is not essential to the functionality of the system  as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities 
change in revenue accounting principle varian semiconductor changed its revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  based on guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
varian implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal year proforma amounts for the periods beginning before the first quarter of fiscal year have not been presented  as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined 
varian semiconductor s previous revenue recognition policy was to recognize product revenue at the time the customer took title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
at that time  varian semiconductor also accrued the costs to install the product 
for some transactions  a portion of the purchase price was not due until installation is complete and the product was accepted by the customer 
under sab and the new accounting method adopted retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal year  installation is considered a separate earnings process  revenue related to new products is recognized upon customer acceptance and revenue related to established products is accounted for as multiple element arrangements as described above 
as a result of this change  varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal year for fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized million in revenue which is included in the cumulative effect adjustment recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year the effect of that revenue was to increase income by million net of million of tax for fiscal year 
table of contents for fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized million in revenue which is included in the cumulative effect adjustment recorded during fiscal year the effect of that revenue was to increase income by million net of million of tax for fiscal year change in inventory accounting principle during the first quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor changed its method of valuing domestic inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
prior to the spin off to shareholders on april   varian semiconductor had operated as a division of varian associates  inc  and had been required to conform to the parent company s lifo method of valuing domestic inventory 
varian semiconductor experienced declining materials costs and anticipated lower material unit costs in the foreseeable future through value engineering 
therefore  varian semiconductor believed the fifo method was preferable since it would more appropriately match revenues and expenses 
additionally  the adoption of the fifo method by varian semiconductor allows more readily comparable financial results with its principal competitors and other companies in the broader semiconductor industry segment where the use of the fifo method of accounting is broadly accepted 
varian semiconductor applied this change retroactively by restating the financial statements as required by apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which resulted in an increase to net income per diluted share for fiscal year of  an increase in retained earnings of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in deferred taxes of million at september  inventory and purchase order commitments varian semiconductor values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the determination of lower of cost or market requires that varian semiconductor make significant assumptions about future demand for products and the transition to new product offerings from legacy products 
varian semiconductor also reserves against those open purchase order commitments in which varian semiconductor s estimated obligation to receive inventory under these commitments exceeds expected production demand 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  supplier lead time and technological and market obsolescence 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
if market conditions are more favorable than those projected by management and specific products previously reserved against are subsequently sold  gross profit would improve by the amount of the specific reserve in the quarter the product is sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts varian semiconductor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services 
accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded 
the remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the amount of days the balance is past due and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history 
if the financial condition of varian semiconductor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if accounts previously identified as a risk and reserved for subsequently stabilize and are deemed to no longer be at risk for collection or categories past due decrease  the allowance for doubtful accounts may be reduced 
as a result  a reduction to bad debt expense would be recognized in the period the determination was made 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  varian semiconductor evaluates the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
varian semiconductor has considered taxable income that can be carried back  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and has concluded that no valuation allowance is required at this time 
an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made  if varian semiconductor determined that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future 
product warranties varian semiconductor provides for the estimated cost of product warranties  primarily from historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
while varian semiconductor engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies  varian semiconductor s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  and supplier warranties on parts delivered to varian semiconductor 
should actual product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from varian semiconductor s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
environmental liabilities liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or varian semiconductor s commitment to a formal plan of action 
in situations where the various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate then future costs  the lower limit of an estimated range is accrued on a non discounted basis 
all other liabilities  which are usually where varian semiconductor has generally sufficient knowledge to be able to better estimate the scope of costs and future activities  are accrued on a discounted basis 
should new information become available and or different assumptions be applied in the estimation of environmental liabilities  revisions to the accrued environmental liability would be required 
derivative financial instruments and forward exchange contracts as a multinational company  varian semiconductor faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as varian semiconductor s business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on varian semiconductor s financial results 
historically  varian semiconductor s primary exposures have resulted from non united states dollar denominated sales and purchases in europe and the asia pacific region 
varian semiconductor does not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
varian semiconductor s forward exchange contracts generally range from one to six months in original maturity 
no forward exchange contract has an original maturity greater than one year 
results of operations fiscal year varian semiconductor s fiscal year is the to week period that ends on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  industry varian semiconductor s business is highly cyclical and depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
in fiscal year  semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
table of contents experienced a significant contraction in the demand for products due to the slowdown in economies worldwide  specifically the slowdown in technology sectors which utilize integrated circuits 
varian semiconductor s business has been materially affected by this contraction  as revenue decreased five sequential consecutive quarters  from million in the first quarter of fiscal year to million in the first quarter of fiscal year excluding the lam royalty and license revenue  described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  for the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  revenue increased to million  million and million  respectively 
although revenue increased sequentially during the last three quarters of fiscal year  this is not necessarily evidence that the downturn in the industry is ending 
projections for the first quarter of fiscal year show a slight decline in revenue  as the current estimate is for revenue to be between million and million 
fluctuations in the timing and mix of product shipments  customer requirements for systems  and the completion of the installation of the product have a significant impact on revenue see also risk factors and critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
varian semiconductor does not have visibility as to the length or sustainability of any potential industry downturn 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and  including non recurring royalty and license revenue of million recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year received in connection with the settlement and license agreement with lam described in more detail below 
fiscal year percent change change amounts in millions revenue product service royalty and license revenue during fiscal year  the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of the downturn in the industry  specifically the reduction in capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and the industry wide decline in demand for semiconductor devices 
revenue is expected to decline in the first quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of the outlook remains difficult to forecast beyond the first quarter of fiscal year  as visibility is limited by the cyclical nature of the industry 
pursuant to the terms of a settlement and license agreement between varian semiconductor and lam research corporation  varian semiconductor received  during the first quarter of fiscal year  a warrant to purchase  shares of lam common stock at per share and a million cash payment in exchange for prior use of certain varian semiconductor patents 
total royalty and license revenue recognized from lam during the first quarter of fiscal year includes the warrant  which was valued at million  and the million cash payment received 
lam made quarterly cash payments of million for the three remaining quarters of fiscal year and will continue to make quarterly cash payments of million through december for future use of the patents 
quarterly cash payments are recognized as royalty and license revenue in the period they become due 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table reflects revenue by geography for fiscal years and  including the non recurring lam royalty and license revenue of million recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year fiscal year amounts in thousands north america europe asia pacific total revenue primarily in the us the decrease in revenue across all geographies during fiscal year was a result of the downturn in the industry see item business for more detail 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  as compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year the decrease in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of a change in product mix and lower parts margins 
this was partially offset by lower warranty costs and improved inventory management 
cost of service revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  as compared to the cost of service revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of improvements in the system installation process resulting in reduced field costs and a reduction in overhead costs  both direct and indirect labor  due to lower headcount 
gross margin on total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year may decline slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to customer pricing pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
research and development expenses are expected to be approximately the same in the first quarter of fiscal year  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year varian semiconductor continues to be committed to investment in product development  particularly the ongoing shift to mm implantors  factory automation  and the transition to advanced technology nodes 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior year mainly due to a lower headcount throughout fiscal year  a decrease in commissions related to the lower revenues caused by the industry downturn and the recovery of bad debt charges taken in fiscal year marketing  general and administrative expenses are expected to approximate the same level in the first quarter of fiscal year  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year restructuring costs 
during october  varian semiconductor implemented a reduction in force  primarily in the us  in which its worldwide workforce was reduced by approximately employees 
varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of fiscal year in september  in anticipation of continued soft demand for semiconductor devices and semiconductor capital equipment  varian semiconductor announced additional actions to restructure its business and reduce costs 
varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents year as a result of this restructuring  approximately employees were terminated worldwide prior to september  there were also charges associated with closing an office and relocating another office 
below is a table summarizing the restructuring reserve activity in fiscal year reduction in work force facility closures other total amounts in thousands balance as of september  new charges non cash items cash payments balance as of september  the majority of the restructuring reserve balance of million  as of september   is expected to be utilized by december varian semiconductor anticipates cash savings of approximately million in fiscal year  as a result of the fiscal year restructurings 
interest income 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in interest income as compared with million for fiscal year despite increased cash balances  interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year due to lower short term interest rates 
other income 
varian semiconductor received a warrant to purchase shares of lam common stock on december  see also note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the warrant was treated as a derivative and was remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date 
under fair value accounting  all gains and losses were reported in other income expense 
the volatility in lam s stock price and other factors resulted in changes to the fair value of the lam warrant 
as a result  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in other income to reflect the fair value accounting of the lam warrant 
on april   varian semiconductor completed the sale of this warrant to an unrelated third party for million in cash 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal years and the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to credits  low taxed foreign income in and tax benefits arising from the use of the extraterritorial income exclusion and tax credits in future tax rates may vary from the historic rates depending on the worldwide allocation of earnings and the continuing availability of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle for the adoption of sab in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  as compared to net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  as compared to net income of per diluted share for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
revenue for the fiscal year was million  as compared to for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or 
had sab not been adopted  a year over year comparison of revenue would have shown a decrease in revenue of million  or 
proforma amounts for the periods beginning 
table of contents before fiscal year have not been presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined 
the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and fiscal year percent change change amounts in millions revenue product service royalty and license revenue during fiscal year  the decrease in total revenue was a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the significant decrease in product revenue was a result of the decline in demand for semiconductor devices beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year service revenue in fiscal year increased compared to fiscal year  although it primarily related to the maintenance and installation services of products that were sold in fiscal year and the first quarter of  as service revenue historically is recognized a few months after product revenue 
over the course of fiscal year  total revenue decreased in each consecutive quarter from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter  and to million in the fourth quarter 
royalty revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  despite the industry downturn primarily due to timing  as revenue recognized from royalties normally lags the sale of the product to the customer 
the following table reflects revenue by geography for fiscal years and fiscal year amounts in thousands north america europe asia pacific total revenue primarily in the us the decrease in europe and asia pacific during fiscal year was a result of the downturn in the industry see item business for more detail 
the increase in revenue in north america resulted from increased volume from several customers compared to their levels and increased royalty revenue  partially offset by lower volumes from other customers due to the decline in demand for semiconductor devices 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  as compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year the decrease in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of the decrease in the volume of product shipments 
cost of service revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  as compared to the cost of service revenue of million and gross margin of 
table of contents for fiscal year the increase in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of the product mix of the installations completed and lower field costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year expenses of million 
research and development expenses were higher largely due to expansion of efforts in both product and services developments reflected in the viista series products for mm applications  including the new high energy viista marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year expenses of million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior year mainly due to efforts to reduce spending in response to the industry downturn 
restructuring costs 
varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs for fiscal year  of which million was recognized in the second quarter and million was recognized in the third quarter 
the restructuring charges primarily reflected the termination costs for a total reduction in force of employees 
all termination costs associated with the restructuring were paid during interest income 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in interest income as compared with million for fiscal year the increase of million was primarily due to higher average cash balances  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
other income  net 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million upon settlement of litigation 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million upon receipt of a payment in settlement of a dispute relating to the acquisition of a product line which occurred in a prior fiscal year 
in addition  after recording a payment to applied materials and legal expenses  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount and the estimated accrual upon settlement of their patent infringement and antitrust litigation 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal years and the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax benefits arising from the use of a foreign sales corporation  the extraterritorial income exclusion and tax credits 
future tax rates may vary from the historic rates depending on the worldwide allocation of earnings and the continuing availability of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle for the adoption of sab in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  as compared with net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  as compared to per diluted share for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million during fiscal year  as compared to cash provided by operations of million during fiscal year in fiscal year  cash provided by operations was primarily a result of a decrease in inventories of million  in addition to net income of million 
these increases to cash during fiscal year were partially offset by the non cash consideration of million in 
table of contents royalty and license income and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operations was primarily a result of decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million  in addition to net income of million  after adjusting for the non cash charge of million arising from a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the increases to cash during fiscal year were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million and deferred revenue of million 
cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal year  including million that was generated from the sale of the lam warrant on april  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this was partially offset by purchases of property plant and equipment of million 
varian semiconductor used million of cash during fiscal year  primarily for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal year  million of cash was provided by financing activities  consisting of million generated from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options  offset by million in repayments of short term borrowings 
during fiscal year  million of cash was provided by financing activities  of which million was generated from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options and million was provided by proceeds from short term borrowings
