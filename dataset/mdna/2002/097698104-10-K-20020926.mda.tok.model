overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
because of the rapid decline in oil prices in  oil companies reduced exploration budgets which caused the company s customers  primarily seismic exploration contractors  to reduce activities 
this reduction in activity resulted in underutilized and idle seismic vessels 
with recent increases in oil and gas prices  seismic contractors have gradually reduced excess vessel capacity but the industry continues to remain cautious in its capital spending plans 
during the last half of fiscal and in fiscal  there has been an increase in marine seismic exploration activity which has benefited the company s geophysical equipment sales and profitability 
as for the industrial products segment of the company s business  sales continue to be adversely affected by the general slowdown in the national economy

results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or reflecting an increase in marine seismic activity 
this increase was partially offset by a  or sales decrease in sales of industrial products compared to the year ended june   as that business was adversely affected by the continuing general economic slowdown 
during the first three quarters of fiscal year  sales of geophysical equipment were depressed due to reduced activity by marine seismic contractors 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the major reason for this improvement was increased manufacturing efficiencies associated with the higher sales volumes for geophysical equipment  partially offset by decreased manufacturing efficiencies for industrial products caused by the lower sales volume in that segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended june  versus the previous fiscal year primarily due to higher compensation costs and professional fees

cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  despite the sales increase for geophysical equipment  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for that segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  reflecting very low factory utilization in the first half of the year and the negative impact of auxiliary equipment purchased for marine air gun systems which have lower margins than the company s proprietary products

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
below  we discuss these policies further 
we also have other key accounting policies including policies for revenue recognition 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and our estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
inventory reserves we establish reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we review such circumstances including when products are not expected to be saleable 
the reserve recorded is equal to all or a portion of the cost of the inventory based on the specific facts and circumstances 
we monitor inventory levels on a regular basis and record changes in inventory reserves in cost of sales 
deferred taxes we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d 
critical accounting policies cont d 
expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
we review our internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make our assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
goodwill and intangible assets in connection with acquisitions  we determine the amounts and related useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangibles based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have been performed by qualified independent appraisers using generally accepted valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows

 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will review goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment

 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement
