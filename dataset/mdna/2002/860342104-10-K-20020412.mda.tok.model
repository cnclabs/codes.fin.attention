with respect to the leadership initiative  many new team members joined the company during fiscal  including the senior vice president and general counsel  senior vice president power products  president tactical vehicle systems  vice president petroleum equipment  president s s tug  and over thirty mid and upper level managers 
working capital improvement initiatives contributed to the generation of million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal in addition  cash and equivalents less total debt at january  totaled a positive million  an improvement of million from the million at january  in the supply chain initiative  the principal focus has been shifted from a corporate driven activity to an effort led by each of the business segments 
a corporate wide purchasing database has been established for the purposes of sharing information across the company 
additionally  a corporate wide engineering council was created to help improve product structuring and configuration management 
the information management systems project is under new leadership and the scope has been expanded to include substantial improvements in basic business processes  including project management  configuration control  bill of materials management  and inventory and production control 
an effort is also under way to improve inquiry to order and order to remittance processes as well as the final integration of the jd edwards software into the manufacturing and service business 
progress was made on growth initiatives despite a tough market environment 
the distributed energy solutions segment reported a million revenue increase during fiscal the power products segment reported a increase in service sales  relocated into a new facility in dallas  texas  and opened up new branches in el paso  texas  stockton  california  and valencia  venezuela 
tactical vehicle systems acquired extended reach logistics  inc  an e commerce business that provides military units and commercial companies with a web based portal for ordering repair parts or component repair services 
the airline products segment is preparing to introduce an expanded line of electric powered products as well as new products currently being offered for the regional jet market 
the petroleum equipment segment recently introduced coil tubing equipment to the underground construction industry for laying fiber optic cable and other utility services 
fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal net earnings from continuing operations for the year grew to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
including discontinued operations  total year net earnings for fiscal and were million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
power products effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal  the power products segment was modified to exclude certain activities pertaining to power generation  which are being reported in a new segment called distributed energy solutions 
the currently reported power products segment sells and rents various industrial equipment  sells components  replacement parts  accessories  and other materials supplied by independent manufacturers  and provides in shop and on site repair services for industrial equipment 
sales for the power products segment in fiscal were million  higher than fiscal sales of million  largely due to higher service sales 
the company has increased the number of service technicians in this segment and continues to focus on the service aspect of this business 
while equipment sales increased modestly year over year  the trend was downward during the fourth quarter  reflecting weakness in selected markets such as oil and gas  material handling  and small power generation equipment 
this market softness was reflected in the equipment order backlog  which decreased million during the year 
parts sales remained steady but were impacted by the continuing retirement of the two cycle engine in the marine market 
in particular  the continuing retirement of the two cycle engine in the marine market has caused the company s supply partners to lose share to competitors as the newer four cycle engines are introduced to the market  which could negatively impact sales in future periods 
operating profit for fiscal was million compared with million for the comparable period of fiscal a million improvement from higher volume was more than offset by million higher expense related to information systems improvements  million of expense related to collectibility of certain accounts receivable  million in inventory valuation adjustments net of a lower lifo reserve which decreased cost of sales by million  and million higher costs due to inflation and other factors 
overall  margin rates on equipment were down while margin rates on parts and service sales remained consistent with prior periods 
the company is continuing the installation of information technology tools to help reduce transaction costs and improve margin rates 
it is expected that the overall market for this segment will be flat to slightly down in fiscal actions being taken to improve profitability in this segment include redesign of business processes to improve accountability and reduce costs  the introduction of new leaders to the business  and improved management information systems 
management continues to monitor the class truck after market activity  the domestic oil and gas markets  and the overall condition of the economy  all of which influence the activity level for this segment 
distributed energy solutions as noted above  the distributed energy solutions segment was reported separately effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal to provide a clearer view of the company s power generation activities and to allow more focus on market opportunities 
sales for the distributed energy solutions segment in fiscal were million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily due to two large turnkey power generation projects in california that were completed in the first half of fiscal an operating loss of million was recorded in fiscal compared to a million operating loss in the comparable period of fiscal the million impact of higher gross margins due to increased volume was more than offset by cost structure increases in houston million and sacramento million  million lifo provisions associated with an inventory ramp up  million in warranty expenses  and million for restructuring and other costs 
the company anticipates a weaker market in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of decreased customer demand and excess power generation capacity and equipment in selected markets 
the company plans to increase focus on natural gas co generation 
actions being taken to improve profitability in this segment include an organization realignment to better focus on market opportunities as well as monitor costs  the introduction of new leaders to the business  and the implementation of new business processes and cost tracking systems 
this segment has a low market share in the markets it serves which should allow for opportunity to grow even in a weakened economy 
however  the contracts that are won in this segment tend to be large in volume and unpredictable as to timing which may cause large quarterly swings in the financial results for this segment going forward 
tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment  which manufactures tactical vehicles for the u 
s 
army and others  recorded sales for fiscal of million versus million a year ago 
total operating profit for fiscal was million  which compared favorably with million a year ago 
included in the current year s operating profit is million in settlement of claims  net of expenses of million  with the us army  as further described below 
in fiscal  the company filed a certified claim with the us government seeking recovery of costs incurred by the company resulting from a delay of over eight months from the original production plan in the first multi year fmtv contract 
the us army and the company reached resolution in april through the alternative dispute resolution process managed by the armed services board of contract appeals  and the company received payment of million in july the us army directed the company to make certain changes in drive train components of all vehicles produced under the first fmtv contract 
the company commenced the installation of the directed changes during fiscal and completed the changes during fiscal the financial responsibility for the cost of the drive train change has been resolved through an alternate dispute resolution proceeding and the us army paid million to the company in december the fmtv incorporates engines  transmissions  axles  and a number of other components specified by the us army and available only from the source selected by them 
interruption of the supply of any of these components could have a material adverse affect on the results of operations of the tactical vehicles systems segment 
the company believes that any delays arising from the unavailability of source specified components would be fully compensated under the fmtv contracts 
the increase in sales in fiscal was due to an increase in the volume of products sold during the year 
in fiscal   trucks and trailers were shipped compared to  trucks and no trailers for the comparable period of fiscal the us army exercised an option to award a fifth program year to the current contract  which added million to the backlog for this segment 
deliveries under this award should begin in october and are expected to be completed by september shipments for fiscal are anticipated to be approximately  trucks and trailers  a portion of which are included in option year production at somewhat lower pricing levels 
the lower pricing in the option year along with bid costs associated with the competitive rebuy should be offset by cost reduction efforts 
as the current contract with the us army for production of the fmtv is nearing completion  the company continues its preparation for the next multi year contract award 
the company has been awarded a contract under the first phase of the competitive bid process and is currently competing for the final award 
the company cannot reliably predict when the us army will make its decision as to the final award for the new production contract or whether the company will receive the award  but the decision is scheduled to be made during the company s first quarter of fiscal and the company believes its proposal will be competitive 
even if the company receives the award  there can be no assurance that operating margins will be at the same level as the existing fmtv contract 
continued success in this segment is dependent on securing additional contracts after completion of the current contract for production of the fmtv at acceptable operating margins 
petroleum equipment the company recently announced its intention to sell the petroleum equipment segment s blowout preventer and controls  valve  and drilling riser business  and as a result  these activities were reclassified for reporting purposes as discontinued operations and are not included in the results of this segment 
see discontinued operations for further discussion 
the currently reported petroleum equipment segment manufactures equipment primarily for the well stimulation industries 
sales for the petroleum equipment segment totaled million for fiscal compared to million last year 
the segment reported a million operating profit in fiscal compared to a million operating profit for fiscal the million benefit from increased volume was more than offset by million increased operating expense to support the increased volume  million in higher information systems expense  a million increase in product warranty costs  and million restructuring costs 
during the last half of fiscal  oil and gas prices dropped significantly resulting in reduced capital spending in the oil and gas markets which has impacted the general business level for this segment 
the downward pressure in this market has resulted in a decrease in backlog at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal management will continue to monitor the changes in the oil and gas market and respond to opportunities as they arise 
a new business leadership team was installed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and efforts are underway to improve basic business processes  reduce costs  and improve margins 
airline products the airline products segment manufactures airline ground support products  mobile railcar movers  and snow blowers 
sales for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal the operating loss for fiscal was million compared to an operating loss of million for the same period in fiscal the increase in operating loss was attributable to lower volume million  restructuring costs million associated with facility and organization consolidations  higher operating costs million associated with facility costs  ramp up of the snow blower business transferred to houston  texas  higher insurance and bad debt expense  and other costs 
these costs were partially offset by lower lifo reserves which decreased cost of sales by million 
sales volume in this segment was impacted by fallout from the september terrorist attack  which resulted in domestic flight schedule reduction approximating and significant cash flow pressures for the airline industry 
as a result  the order backlog decreased by million during the fiscal year 
this segment s customers in the passenger airline industry are still cautious as they assess their equipment requirements in the coming year 
while airlines have begun to restore flight schedules  it is unlikely that normal levels of airline ground support equipment purchases will be restored until fiscal consolidation of production facilities  coupled with significant staff reductions associated with organization realignments should reduce the breakeven point for this segment 
in addition  a new leadership team was installed in january other business other business activities not identified in a specific segment include predominantly sales of gas compression equipment and wheel chair lifts 
fiscal sales were million versus million in fiscal operating profit for the year totaled million versus million last year which included a million gain on sale of the gas compression equipment leasing business 
fiscal vs 
fiscal sales for fiscal totaled  million compared to million in fiscal net earnings from continuing operations for the year totaled million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per share  in the prior year 
including discontinued operations  total year net earnings for fiscal and were million  or per diluted share  and million  or per share  respectively 
during fiscal  the company made significant progress in five important management initiatives 
the result of this progress has been to improve its balance sheet  to increase its profit margins  and to grow organically or internally its businesses 
with regards to the improvement of the balance sheet  during fiscal the company increased its cash and cash equivalents by million  reduced its total debt by million  and improved its current ratio to 
while the company has made significant progress in reducing its inventory and accounts receivable levels  it continues to focus on further reductions 
increased profit margins are ultimately reflected in net earnings from continuing operations  which  as mentioned above  were significantly improved versus fiscal sales for the year increased versus fiscal the power products segment  which is responsible for marketing and aftermarket support of a wide range of industrial equipment  recorded fiscal sales of million  higher than fiscal sales of million 
operating profit for fiscal was million compared with million last year 
operations in fiscal were adversely impacted by special charges of million  principally in connection with an uncollectible account and note receivable  and inventory reserves 
order backlog for this segment decreased million during the year 
the power products segment relies on a number of markets for top line growth 
the power products segment also participates in the oil and gas market through the sale of equipment  parts  and service for the propulsion and power of marine support vessels  and through the application of off highway internal combustion engines  along with service and parts support for land based applications 
while these markets strengthened during the year  the power products segment continues to monitor the land based class on highway transportation markets for signs of weakness which could occur as a result of a softening of the overall economy 
latin american sales were strong in fiscal however  there remains an element of volatility as these markets continue to mature and grow 
the power products segment realized increasing sales in each successive quarter of fiscal while the segment was able to enjoy modest price increases on some of its products and services  the increased sales in fiscal were primarily attributable to increased volumes 
parts  equipment  and service sales and profitability all showed a positive trend throughout the year 
during fiscal  the company added approximately service technicians to promote organic growth 
power products segment management continues to focus on business process improvement and reducing administrative expenses in an effort to improve its operating profit  and to further reduce its working capital 
the distributed energy solutions segment reported sales of million and an operating loss of million in fiscal this segment was not in existence in fiscal and the results of any activities of a similar nature are included in the results of the power products segment 
the operating loss in fiscal was due to higher operating costs associated with startup of this segment compared to sales at a volume below that required to achieve break even in this segment 
the tactical vehicle systems segment  which manufactures tactical vehicles for the us army and others  recorded sales for fiscal of million versus million a year ago 
total year operating profit for fiscal was million  which compared favorably with million a year ago 
the tactical vehicle systems segment experienced significantly improved results for fiscal versus fiscal  as sales almost doubled 
the increase in sales was primarily the result of an increase in the volume of products sold 
the segment shipped approximately  trucks during fiscal the petroleum equipment segment manufactures equipment for oil and gas exploration  production  and well stimulation industries 
sales in this segment totaled million for fiscal compared to million last year 
the segment reported a million operating profit in fiscal and a million operating loss in fiscal the order backlog at the end of fiscal totaled million  well above the million at fiscal year end 
while the petroleum equipment segment was able to enjoy modest price increases on some of its products and services  the increased operating profit in fiscal were primarily attributable to increased volumes 
during the first half of the year  while the markets for its products were comparatively soft  the company was not able to fully utilize its infrastructure and absorbed its fixed costs over a relatively low volume of sales 
later in the year  as demand rapidly increased  the segment incurred a substantial amount of overtime expense  as the tight labor markets did not allow the company to increase staffing to optimal levels 
the airline products segment manufactures airline ground support products  mobile railcar movers  and snow blowers 
sales for fiscal were million versus million the previous year 
operating losses were reported for both years million in fiscal and million in fiscal and results for fiscal included million in inventory write downs 
the continuing disappointing performance in airline products results principally from production and inventory process issues  and to a lesser extent  softness in demand from airline customers 
the company s management has made the restoration of profitability to this segment a high priority 
furthermore  a shift in the industry to electric propulsion products and the growth of regional airlines that require smaller foot print products could provide the company with an opportunity to better serve those markets 
however  the airline industry continues to experience increased fuel expenses and reduced travel spending by its customers due to a general softening of the us economy 
these factors could result in lower industry profits  which could impact the available business for the company s ground support products 
other business activities not identified in a specific segment include predominantly gas compression equipment sales 
fiscal sales were million versus million in fiscal operating profit for the year totaled million and included a million gain on sale of the gas compression equipment leasing business

critical accounting policies the company believes the following accounting policies represent those which have the most impact on the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
generally  revenue is recognized when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or accepted by the customer  except for certain equipment contracts  where revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the revenues of the tactical vehicle systems segment are generally recognized under the units of production method  whereby sales and cost of the units produced under the family of medium tactical vehicle fmtv contracts are recognized as units are accepted by the us government 
cost of sales for units accepted are based on actual unit cost 

changes in estimates for revenues  costs  and profits are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable using the cumulative catch up method of accounting applied on an annual basis 
in certain cases  the estimated revenue values include amounts expected to be realized from contract adjustments when recovery of such amounts is probable 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged in full to operations in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
from time to time  the company assesses the valuation of its long lived assets for impairment 
in so doing  it utilizes operating plans  budgets  and forecasts and recognizes impairments when expected future cash flows associated with these assets is less than book value 
the company extends credit and credit enhancements to customers and other parties in the normal course of business and management regularly reviews outstanding receivables  and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events  and other factors 
inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost using lifo or market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values  less related customer deposits 
work in process costs include material  labor  and overhead 
the aggregate carrying values of these inventories are not in excess of their fair values 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations and retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and makes judgments as the level of losses to provide for through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
as revenue is recorded  expected warranty and performance guarantee costs are accrued  based on both historical experience and contract terms 
should actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from the company s current estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a significant element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate for calculating future liability 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which results in an estimated return on plan assets that is included in current year pension income or expense

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
both statements are effective for the company s fiscal  which begins on february  under these new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other identifiable intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company expects that it will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company amortized approximately million of goodwill 
such amortization expense will cease beginning with the first quarter of the company s fiscal the company expects to complete its impairment testing on remaining goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal and expects to recognize an impairment of approximately to million as a result of this testing  subject to continuing analysis 
this charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and is primarily related to the goodwill associated with the airline products segment

factors that may affect future results cautionary statements certain of the statements contained in this document  including those made under the captions business  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of other than statements of historical fact included herein  all statements herein  including in particular  but not limited to  statements regarding potential future products and markets  our future financial position or results of operations  business strategy  other plans  and objectives for future operations  relating to trends  expressing our belief  referring to expectations  referring to backlogs as to future product deliveries  relating to long term contracts in progress or using the verbs should  could  may  and verbs of similar import and prospective focus  are forward looking statements 
we can give no assurance that any forward looking statement of ours will prove to have been correct and such statements are not guarantees of future performance 
they involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict  and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted or implied in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
specific important factors that could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from our forward looking statements  and that otherwise may affect our operations  are identified below 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
o risk of competition 
our foreign and domestic competitors may use their resources and product and service offerings to increase competition  both in prices and products and services offered  and thereby reduce our market shares and or sales and profitability 
some of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing  financial  and technical resources than we have  and these resources may be used in effective competition with us 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be a reasonably effective competitor in our markets 
o risks relating to technology 
our business will suffer if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological change and product development 
our success will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry requirements and to respond to technological developments on a timely basis  either internally or through strategic alliances 
we will likely be constantly threatened by current competitors or new market entrants who may develop new technologies or products or establish new standards that could render our products less marketable or obsolete 
thus  we can offer no assurances that we will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  products or product enhancements that respond to our competition  to technological developments  to changing industry standards  and to market place acceptability 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we can reasonably keep pace with our competitors in technology changes and product development 
o risks of general economic conditions 
our commercial operations are cyclical and dependent for success on the general economic well being of the united states and certain other world markets 
a general economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
although the economy of the united states experienced one of its longest periods of growth in recent years  the continued strength of the united states economy cannot be assured 
notwithstanding that period of growth  in there was a marked period of economic slowdown 
even though some recent data is encouraging about the us economy  there are still some signs that we are in a period of a world economic slowdown 
if the united states or world economies fail to recover or decline  the demand for  and price of  our products and services could be adversely affected  thus adversely affecting our revenues and income 
further  other general market conditions such as increased inflation and higher interest rates could also adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements we have assumed that a worldwide recession or material downturn in the united states economy  to the extent they may exist at present  will not continue or worsen and that we are not entering a new and significant down cycle in our markets or a period of significantly increasing inflation and interest rates 
o risks of oil and gas industry economic conditions 
our petroleum equipment segment  as well as certain aspects of our power products and distributed energy solutions segments  are closely tied to the oil and gas industry in general and  in particular  to capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and companies providing services and manufactured products to the oil and gas industry 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years and which were somewhat depressed particularly for natural gas in fiscal a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and oil and gas service and manufacturing companies  as we have experienced in the most recent year and also in some other recent years  will likely lead to a drop in demand for products and services in our petroleum equipment segment as well as in our distributed energy solutions and power products segments  which also provide products and services used in connection with the exploration for and production of oil and gas 
any such drop will have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as it did during fiscal there are some recent modest signs of recovery in the oil and gas industry  and we have assumed in our forward looking statements that economic conditions in such industry will stabilize at least at present levels or improve and that capital expenditures in the industry will not continue to be unduly restrained in future periods 
o risks of airline industry economic conditions 
our airline products segment is highly dependent upon the economic well being of the airline industry and was adversely affected in by serious difficulties in that industry  including difficulties arising following the terrorist attacks on the us in september  capital and other general expenditures by airline companies are the principal source for demand for the products of our airline products segment 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by airline companies and other companies that cater to the airline industry  the demand for our products in our airline products segment will drop and there will likely be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as there was in in our forward looking statements we continue to be cautious as to the recovery of economic conditions in the airline and related industries and do not anticipate quick and or complete recovery 
o risks as to terrorist attacks on the us and their impact on the us economy 
while we are not yet able to evaluate fully the ongoing impacts of the recent terrorist attacks on the us which appear to have coincided with or contributed to a general downturn in the us economy  or the threat of further such incidents  such circumstances may continue to adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot yet identify 
however  both the past attacks and threats of future ones may adversely affect the demand for our products and services generally in addition to their specific impact on our segments that serve the oil and gas and airline industries 
our forward looking statements at present assume no further material impacts of such circumstances on the us or further deterioration on our affected business 
o risks relating to personnel 
labor shortages and our inability to recruit and retain key employees and workers could limit our operations and increase our labor costs and  in turn  adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing and service operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain key managers and qualified machinists  mechanics  factory workers  and other laborers 
while there are some signs that the us and world economies are strengthening and labor markets improving  there continued to be a strong labor market in the us in general even during the slower periods of a strong labor market can adversely impact us by limiting our manufacturing capacity or resulting in significantly increased wages and other benefits to attract additional key employees and workers 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel at overall costs that are comparable with our ability to produce revenues 
o risks of dependence on government 
because the us government is one of our key customers  decreased government spending or termination of significant government programs could adversely affect our business 
our tactical vehicle systems segment depends largely on us government expenditures 
in recent years  government contracts in such segment have accounted for substantial percentages of our annual revenues and operating income 
we are currently in production year four of our second multi year contract with the us department of the army us army for production of the family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv 
the us army exercised an option to award a fifth program year to the current contract  which begins in october and is expected to be completed by september the us army holds an additional option to award a sixth program year that  if exercised by the us army  could extend production of the fmtv through september the funding of the new fmtv contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts that may be canceled or adjusted by the government  the fmtv contract must be funded annually by the us department of the army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
as of january   funding in the amount of approximately billion for the fmtv contract had been authorized and appropriated by the us congress 
if the fmtv contract is terminated  other than for our default in which event there could be serious adverse consequences and claims against us  the contract includes a provision under which we will be reimbursed for certain allowable costs but not necessarily for all costs 
as our current contract with the us army for production of the fmtv is nearing completion  it will be necessary for us to secure additional contracts for us to have continued success in this segment 
we have been awarded a contract under the first phase of the competitive bid process for the next multi year contract for production of the fmtv and are currently competing for the final award 
the us army is scheduled to make its decision as to the final award of the next multi year contract during our first quarter of fiscal the us army will determine the award by a competitive bid process  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such regard or that our competitor will not be more successful than we will be in this or coming bids and awards for tactical vehicles 
even if we do receive the award  there can be no assurance that operating margins will be at the same level as the existing fmtv contract 
moreover  there can be no assurance as to whether future governmental spending will adequately support our business in this area  and substantial decreases in government spending  the loss of the us government as a customer or the cancellation of key significant government programs could materially and adversely affect our operations 
even if government spending in general continues at current levels  we are not assured that we can compete effectively as to the receipt of specific government orders and contract awards or as to the timing thereof 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will continue to have satisfactory benefits from our government contracting business 
o inherent risks of government contracts 
government contracts present us with numerous special risks that are inherent in their nature and that could adversely affect our operations 
government contracts are often relatively large in our business 
major contracts for military systems are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
whether we are able to obtain ultimate profitability on military contracts that we may receive often depends on the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government  and  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation and claim negotiation process  no assurances can be given that our estimates of ultimate profitability will be accurate 
moreover  estimates as to percentage of completion accounting on large government contracts can prove to have been incorrect 
variances between actual results and such estimates could be material 
furthermore  there are inherent risks in projecting actual costs on multi year government contracts because of unforeseen factors  including price and wage inflation and supply shortages 
our government contracting operations are subject to us government investigations of business practices and cost classifications and legal and administrative proceedings can flow from our practices 
under certain circumstances a contractor can be fined as well as suspended or debarred from government contracting 
suspension or debarment could prevent us from selling equipment or services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from other us government agencies such as the export import bank and the overseas private investment corporation 
in such events we might otherwise not be able to receive the benefits of federal assistance payments during a suspension or debarment 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed our reasonable management of risks inherent in our government contracting business 
o risks of claims and litigation 
unexpected outcomes of pending litigation and governmental proceedings and future unexpected litigation and legal disputes could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
if we experience materially adverse and unexpected outcomes or other unexpected results in our existing litigation and government proceedings  which in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  the accuracy of our forward looking statements would be affected 
similarly  if we experience in the future new  unexpected litigation or adverse results from new  unexpected litigation  there could also be a material adverse effect on our results  again affecting the accuracy of our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements assume that there will be no such unexpected outcomes or results that we have not already adequately provided for 
o risks of product defects 
our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes  and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service and warranty and replacement costs and may cause damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may negatively impact our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will not in the future incur material difficulties with respect to product defects and warranty claims 
o risks as to foreign sales and global trade matters 
foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the us  including the risk of war  terrorist activities  civil disturbances  embargoes  and government activities  all of which may disrupt markets 
foreign sales are also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws  including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions 
sales in certain foreign countries require prior us government approval in the form of an export license 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign sales 
moreover  changes in global trade policies in our markets could impact our operations in these markets 
recent events concerning the adoption by the us of certain tariffs on foreign imported steel and other products could cause other countries to retaliate and other disruptions in global trade policies 
we have assumed in connection with our forward looking statements that there will be no material changes in global trading policies  such as embargoes  new and large tariffs  or other tax assessments and the like or other new and material restrictions on trade  that apply in particular to our businesses 
o risks as to cost controls 
as a manufacturing and service company operating within tight margins and with substantial facilities and inventories and a large workforce  our operations have been  and can be  adversely affected by our inability to control costs and to accurately estimate and plan our costs on an exacting basis 
as a manufacturing and service company it is particularly important for us to estimate and control our costs and expenses  and we continuously endeavor to implement cost identification  estimation  and savings measures in our operations 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to contain our costs and expense increases at reasonable levels consistent with expected revenues 
o risks as to information technology 
we have recently added  at substantial costs  new information processing systems designed to assist us in cost controls  reporting  and other operations areas 
we anticipate the need to make additional expenditures to increase the efficiency and usefulness of such systems and have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of implementation of such systems 
accordingly  we are at risk as to further costs and implementation problems on our relatively new information technology systems that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will control the costs of such systems in line with our expectations for such systems and that we will successfully implement them 
o risks as to acquisitions 
our success is dependent upon the integration of newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
our forward looking statements assume the successful integration of acquired businesses and their future contribution to our operations even though integration of acquisitions requires constant effort  including attention to personnel and cost issues  and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of our integration efforts 
o risks as to currency fluctuations 
a material change in currency exchange rates in our markets could affect our future results as well as affect the carrying values of certain of our assets 
world currencies have been subject to much volatility in recent years 
the us dollar has been strong against most currencies over the past year 
our forward looking statements assume no material impact from future changes in currency exchange rates 
o risks as to environmental and safety matters 
our operations and products  and the use thereof  are regulated under a number of federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products and in their servicing and distribution  as we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations  and we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities and with respect to our products and the use thereof and our service operations 
those laws and regulations may also subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any financial liability or business disruption from environmental or health and safety issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our forward looking statements assume no material adverse impact from environmental and safety issues 
o risks as to distributorships 
our power products and distributed energy solutions segments are  in particular  dependent upon a number of distribution agreements with third party manufacturers 
all of our distribution agreements either have expiration dates or are terminable upon certain notifications 
even those with expiration dates are also terminable based on other factors  including changes in our control or in our principal management 
while our principal distribution agreements have been renewed on a regular basis in the past  there can be no assurance that any particular distribution agreement will be renewed in the future or that  on the whole  our principal distribution agreements will continue to be renewed 
the termination of  or a failure to renew  key distribution agreements could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal distribution agreements will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal 
o credit risks 
we believe that our allowance for bad debts at january   is adequate in light of known circumstances 
however  we cannot give assurance that additional amounts of uncollectible receivables and bad debt write offs will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
many of our customers have suffered from lower revenues and experienced liquidity challenges resulting from the economic difficulties throughout our industry and the industries we have served in recent periods 
we have in the past incurred write offs in our accounts receivable due to customer credit problems 
we have also found it necessary to extend trade credit and credit enhancements to long term customers and others from time to time where some risks of nonpayment or late payment exist 
substantial unanticipated credit issues can adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our current reserves and allowances will be sufficient to avoid future material impacts on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk stewart stevenson s market risk results from volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is monitored and managed 
stewart stevenson s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its debt portfolio 
to limit interest rate risk on borrowings  the company targets a portfolio within certain parameters for fixed and floating rate loans taking into consideration the interest rate environment and the company s forecasted cash flow 
this policy limits exposure to rising interest rates and allows the company to benefit during periods of falling interest rates 
the company s interest rate exposure is generally limited to its short term uncommitted bank credit facilities and its unsecured revolving credit notes 
see liquidity and capital resources in item above 
the table below provides information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
principal amount by expected maturity in thousands  except interest rate data fiscal years ending january  thereafter fixed rate long term debt   average interest rate floating rate long term debt total   the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
generally  the company s contracts provide for payment in us dollars and the company does not maintain significant foreign currency cash balances 
foreign subsidiaries have in country working capital loans  which limit the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
certain suppliers bill in foreign currencies 
the company may enter into forward contracts to hedge these specific commitments and anticipated transactions but not for speculative or trading purposes
