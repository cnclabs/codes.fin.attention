environmental matters federal  regional  state and local authorities regulate the environmental impacts of our operations 
areas of regulation include air quality  water quality  site remediation  land use  waste disposal  aesthetics and other matters 
compliance with environmental requirements has caused us and our subsidiaries to modify the day to day operation of our facilities  to participate in the cleanup of various properties that have been contaminated and to modify  supplement and replace existing equipment and facilities 
during  pse g and power expended approximately million for capital related expenditures to improve the environment and comply with laws and regulations and estimates that they will expend approximately million  million and million in the years through  respectively  including such amounts discussed in the psd new source review section below 
air pollution control federal air pollution laws such as the federal clean air act caa and the regulations implementing those laws  require controls of emissions from sources of air pollution  and also impose record keeping  reporting and permit requirements 
facilities that power operates or in which it has an ownership interest are subject to these federal requirements  as well as requirements established under state and local air pollution laws applicable where those facilities are located 
capital costs of complying with air pollution control requirements through are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in md a 
prevention of significant deterioration psd new source review nsr in november  the federal government announced the filing of lawsuits by several states against seven companies operating power plants in the midwest and southeast  charging that coal fired plants in ten states violated the psd nsr requirements of the caa 
generally  these regulations require major sources of certain air pollutants to obtain permits  install pollution control technology and obtain offsets in some circumstances when those sources undergo a major modification  as defined in the regulations 
various environmental and public interest organizations have given notice of their intent to file similar lawsuits 
the federal government is seeking to order these companies to install the best available air pollution control technology at the affected plants and to pay monetary penalties of up to  for each day of continued violation 
public service enterprise group incorporated the epa and the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep issued a demand in march under section of the caa requiring information to assess whether projects completed since at the hudson and mercer coal burning units were implemented in accordance with applicable psd nsr regulations 
power completed its response to the section information request in november in january  power reached an agreement with the state and federal governments to resolve allegations of noncompliance with federal and state of new jersey psd nsr regulations 
under that agreement  over the course of years power will install advanced air pollution controls that will dramatically reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox  sulfur dioxides so  particulate matter  and mercury from the hudson and mercer coal units 
the estimated cost of the program is million to be incurred through power also will pay a million civil penalty and spend up to million on supplemental environmental projects 
capital costs of complying with these and other air pollution control requirements through are included in our estimate of construction expenditures see capital requirements of md a 
the agreement is still subject to public comment and judicial approval as to which no assurances can be given 
as noted below  future environmental initiatives are expected to require reduced emissions of nox  so  mercury  and possibly co from electric generating facilities 
the emission reductions to be achieved at the hudson and mercer coal units are expected to assist in complying with such future requirements 
in  the epa indicated that it was considering enforcement action under its psd rules relating to the construction of bergen  scheduled for operation in the epa maintained that psd requirements were applicable to bergen  thereby requiring fossil to obtain a permit before beginning actual on site construction 
the agreement resolving the nsr allegations concerning the hudson and mercer coal fired units also resolved the dispute over bergen  and allowed construction of the unit to be completed and operation to commence 
sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide to reduce emissions of so  the caa sets a cap on total so emissions from affected units and allocates so allowances each allowance authorizes the emission of one ton of so to those units 
generation units needing to cover emissions above their allocations can buy allowances from sources that have excess allowances 
similarly  to reduce emissions of nox  which contribute to the formation of smog  northeastern states and the district of columbia have set a cap on total emissions of nox from affected units  and allocated nox allowances with each allowance authorizing the emission of one ton of nox to those units 
the cap applies from may through september  a period commonly referred to as the ozone season 
the nox allowances can be bought and sold through a regional trading program similar to the trading of so allowances 
in  the cap will be reduced to limit nox emissions further 
in  the epa issued regulations commonly known as the sip call requiring the states in the eastern half of the united states to make significant nox emission reductions by and to subsequently cap these emissions 
in january  the epa adopted a revised rule granting petitions filed by certain northeastern states under section of the caa 
the petitions sought significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from utility and industrial sources 
the rule imposes emission reduction requirements comparable to the nox sip call rule 
the epa has delayed the implementation of the sip call and the section rule until may  the nox reduction requirements of the sip call and the section rule are consistent with requirements already in place in new jersey  new york and pennsylvania  and therefore are not likely to have an additional impact on or change the public service enterprise group incorporated capacity available from our existing facilities 
new facilities that power is developing in ohio and indiana will be subject to rules that those states are expected to promulgate to comply with the sip call 
to comply with the so and nox requirements  affected units may choose one or more strategies  including installing air pollution control technologies  changing or limiting operations  changing fuels or obtaining additional allowances 
at this time  power does not expect to incur material expenditures to continue complying with the so program 
power also does not expect that the potential costs for purchasing additional nox allowances will be material through december  in  when the nox cap is reduced in new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  and other northeastern states  the cost of complying with the nox program in those states may increase significantly 
whether the cost will increase or decrease will depend upon whether power will be a net purchaser or seller of nox allowances 
the extent of any increase or decrease will depend upon a number of factors that may increase or decrease total nox emissions from affected units  thus increasing or decreasing demand for a fixed supply of allowances 
power has been implementing measures to reduce nox emissions at several of its units  which will reduce the cost of purchasing allowances 
in december  the epa proposed to approve plans by several states including new jersey and certain other northern states to attain the ozone national ambient air quality standards 
that approval is contingent on these states implementing new programs to further reduce emissions of smog forming chemicals including nox 
the affected northeastern states have committed to make these reductions  and were required to have selected measures by october  to achieve the reductions 
measures selected by the states are currently under epa review 
measures under consideration may increase demand for nox allowances and  consequently  increase their prices 
in  the epa adopted a new air quality standard for fine particulate matter  and a revised air quality standard for ozone 
to attain the fine particulate matter standard  states may require further reductions in nox and so however  under the time schedule announced by the epa when the new standard was adopted  non attainment areas will not be designated until and control measures to meet this standard will not be identified until additionally  similar nox and so reductions may be required to satisfy requirements of an epa rule protecting visibility in many of the nation s scenic areas  including some areas near our facilities 
states or the federal government may require additional reductions in nox emissions from electric generating facilities as part of an effort to achieve the revised ozone standard 
other air pollutants the caa directed the epa to study potential public health impacts of hazardous air pollutants haps emitted from electric utility steam generating units 
in december  the epa announced its intent to regulate hap emissions from coal fired and oil fired steam units  concluding that these emissions pose significant hazards to public health 
epa plans to develop maximum achievable control technology mact standards for these units 
the epa plans to propose the mact standards by december and promulgate a final rule by december  with compliance to be required by december in december  delegates from the us and other nations agreed to a treaty known as the kyoto protocol 
if the us were to ratify the treaty  it would be bound to reduce emissions of co and certain other greenhouse gases by below levels 
however  in march  president bush announced that the united states would not ratify the treaty 
on january   power announced a voluntary agreement that calls for a goal of reducing by december  the annual average carbon dioxide emission rate of its fossil fuel fired electric generating units by below the average annual carbon dioxide emission rate of its new jersey fossil fuel fired electric generating units 
fossil also has agreed to make a million grant to the njdep to assist in the development of landfill gas projects  and to make an additional grant equal to per ton of co emitted greater than the goal  up to million  if that reduction is not achieved 
public service enterprise group incorporated water pollution control the federal water pollution control act fwpca prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the united states from point sources  except pursuant to a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit issued by epa or by a state under a federally authorized state program 
the fwpca authorizes the imposition of technology based and water quality based effluent limits to regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters 
epa has delegated authority to a number of state agencies  including the njdep  to administer the npdes program through state acts 
the new jersey water pollution control act njwpca authorizes the njdep to implement regulations and to administer the npdes program with epa oversight  and to issue and enforce new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system njpdes permits 
we also have ownership interests in domestic and international facilities in jurisdictions that have their own laws and implementing regulations to regulate discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly regulate our facilities in these jurisdictions 
the epa is conducting a rulemaking under fwpca section b  which requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available bta for minimizing adverse environmental impact 
phase i of the rule became effective on january  none of the projects that power currently has under construction are subject to the phase i rule 
the epa is scheduled to propose draft phase ii rules covering large existing power plants on february   and issue final rules on august  the content of the final phase ii rules cannot be predicted at this time  although it is reasonable to expect that the rule will apply to all of power s steam electric and combined cycle units that use surface waters for cooling purposes 
if the phase ii rules require retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at our existing facilities  the cost of complying with the rules would be material and could require certain of the facilities to be closed 
on june   the njdep issued a renewal permit the permit for salem  with an effective date of august   allowing for the continued operation of salem with its existing cooling water system 
this permit renews salem s variance from applicable thermal water quality standards under section a of the fwpca  determines that the existing intake structure represents best technology available under section b of the fwpca  requires that power continue to implement the wetlands restoration and fish ladder programs established under the njpdes permit issued for salem  and imposes requirements for additional analyses of data and studies to determine if other intake technologies are available for application at salem that are biologically effective 
the permit also requires us to install up to two additional fish ladders in new jersey and fund a  escrow account for the construction of artificial reefs by njdep 
the permit expires on july  power has also reached a settlement with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control dnrec providing that nuclear will fund additional habitat restoration and enhancement activities as well as fisheries monitoring and that power and dnrec will work cooperatively on the finalization of other regulatory approvals required for implementation of the permit 
as part of this agreement  power deposited approximately million into an escrow account to be used for future costs related to this settlement 
in  the delaware river basin commission the drbc had issued a docket for salem docket that approved the construction and operation of the station s cooling water system 
in  the drbc had issued a revised docket for salem revised docket that amended the heat dissipation area hda established in the docket  and approved the continued operation of the station s cooling water system 
at its meeting on september   the drbc unanimously approved our request for revisions to the revised docket 
the docket  as revised  provides for an hda consistent with the hydrothermal modeling studies conducted in connection with the renewal application for salem s njpdes permit  incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of the public service enterprise group incorporated permit  rescinds the revised docket  and establishes a twenty five year term for the docket 
the newly revised docket again includes a re opener clause that allows the drbc to re consider the terms and conditions of the docket  based upon changed circumstances 
capital costs of complying with water pollution control requirements through are included in our estimate of construction expenditures in md a 
hudson and mercer generation stations the njdep is in the process of reviewing the njpdes permit renewal application for our hudson station 
as part of that renewal  the njdep has requested updated information  in part to address issues identified by a consultant hired by njdep 
the consultant recommended that hudson station be retrofitted to operate with closed cycle cooling to address alleged adverse impacts associated with the thermal discharge and intake structure 
power proposed certain modifications to the intake structure and submitted these demonstrations to njdep in the fourth quarter of power believes that these demonstrations address the issues identified by the njdep s consultant and provide an adequate basis for favorable determinations under the fwpca without the imposition of closed cycle cooling  although no assurances can be given 
the njdep has advised us that it is reviewing a njpdes permit renewal application for mercer station  and in connection with that renewal  will be reexamining the effects of mercer station s cooling water system pursuant to fwpca 
power has submitted updated demonstrations to the njdep 
it is impossible to predict the timing and or outcome of the review of these applications in respect of the hudson and mercer generation stations 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows 
power believes that the current operations of its stations are in compliance with fwpca and will vigorously prosecute our applications to continue operations of its generating stations with present cooling water intake structures 
control of hazardous substances pse g manufactured gas plant remediation program for information regarding pse g s manufactured gas plant remediation program  see note commitments and contingent liabilities of notes 
hazardous substances generators of hazardous substances potentially face joint and several liability  without regard to fault  when they fail to manage these materials properly and when they are required to clean up property affected by the production and discharge of such substances 
certain federal and state laws authorize the epa and the njdep  among other agencies  to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances 
because of the nature of pse g s and power s businesses  including the production of electricity  the distribution of gas and  formerly  the manufacture of gas  various by products and substances are or were produced or handled that contain constituents classified by federal and state authorities as hazardous 
for discussions of these hazardous substance issues and a discussion of potential liability for remedial action regarding the passaic river  see note commitments and contingent liabilities 
for a discussion of remediation clean up actions involving pse g and power  see item legal proceedings 
other liabilities associated with environmental remediation include natural resource damages 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla and the new jersey spill compensation and control act spill act authorize federal and state trustees for natural resources to assess public service enterprise group incorporated damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance  which discharge resulted in an injury to natural resources 
until recently  the state trustee  njdep  has not aggressively pursued natural resource damages 
in  the njdep adopted changes to the technical requirements for site remediation pursuant to the spill act 
among these changes was a new provision requiring all persons conducting remediation to characterize injuries to natural resources 
further  these changes required persons to address those injuries through restoration or damages 
power cannot assess the magnitude of the potential impact of this regulatory change 
although not currently estimable  these costs could be material 
a preliminary review of possible mercury contamination at the kearny station  concluded that an additional study and investigations are required 
a remedial investigation ri was conducted and a report was submitted to the njdep in this report is currently under technical review 
as currently issued  the ri report found that the mercury at the site is stable and immobile and should be addressed at the time the kearny station is retired 
the epa has determined that a six mile stretch of the passaic river in the area of newark  new jersey is a facility within the meaning of that term under the cercla and that  to date  at least thirteen corporations  including pse g and power  may be potentially liable for performing required remedial actions to address potential environmental pollution at the passaic river facility 
power has one plant and pse g has one former electric plant and four former manufactured gas plants within the passaic river facility 
we cannot predict what action  if any  the epa or any third party may take against them with respect to these matters  or in such event  what costs power or pse g may incur to address any such claims 
however  such costs may be material 
the epa conducted an inspection of spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plan compliance at three of pse g s substation facilities in the epa identified certain procedural and substantive deficiencies in the spcc plans for these sites 
pse g has submitted revised spcc plans to the epa for these sites and is currently working with the epa to finalize these spcc plans 
in  pse g evaluated spcc plan compliance at all of spcc substations and identified deficiencies 
the necessary upgrades are now in the process of being made 
it is anticipated that these upgrades will take several years to complete 
nuclear fuel disposal after spent fuel is removed from a nuclear reactor  it is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the nuclear station site 
under the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa  as amended  the federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate disposal of the spent fuel to pay for this service  the nuclear plant operators were required to contribute to a nuclear waste fund at a rate of one mil per kwh of nuclear generation  subject to such escalation as may be required to assure full cost recovery by the federal government 
these costs are being recovered through the bgs contract through july in addition  a one time payment was made to the doe for permanently discharged spent fuels irradiated prior to payments made to the united states department of energy doe for disposal costs are based on nuclear generation and are included in energy costs in the consolidated statements of income 
under the nwpa  the doe was required to begin taking possession of all spent nuclear fuel generated by the power s nuclear units for disposal by no later than doe construction of a permanent disposal facility has not begun and doe has announced that it does not expect a facility to be available earlier than in february  president bush announced that yucca mountain in nevada was designated as the permanent disposal facility for nuclear wastes 
the states have thirty days to object  and  if objections are raised  the issue will be determined by the us congress 
no assurances can be given as to the final outcome of this matter 
exelon has advised power that it had signed an agreement with the doe applicable to peach bottom under which exelon would be reimbursed for costs resulting from the doe s delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel 
the agreement allows exelon to reduce the charges paid to the nuclear waste fund to reflect costs reasonably incurred due to the doe s delay 
past and future expenditures associated with peach bottom s recently completed on site dry storage facility would be eligible for this reduction in future doe fees 
in  a group of eight utilities filed a petition against doe in the eleventh circuit us court of appeals seeking to set aside the receipt of credits out of the nuclear waste fund  as stipulated in the peach bottom agreement 
on september  nuclear filed a complaint in the u 
s 
court of federal claims seeking damages caused by the doe not taking possession of spent nuclear fuel in no assurances can be given as to any damage recovery or the ultimate availability of a disposal facility 
public service enterprise group incorporated pursuant to nrc rules  spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in independent spent fuel storage installations located at reactor or away from reactor sites for at least years beyond the licensed life for reactor operation which may include the term of a revised or renewed license 
the availability of adequate spent fuel storage capacity is estimated through for salem  for salem and for hope creek 
power presently expects to construct an on site storage facility that would satisfy the spent fuel storage needs of both salem and hope creek through the end of the license life 
this construction will require certain regulatory approvals  the timely receipt of which cannot be assured 
exelon has advised power that it has constructed an on site dry storage facility at peach bottom that is now licensed and operational and can provide storage capacity through the end of the current licenses for the two peach bottom units 
on july  an application was submitted to the nrc to renew the operating licenses for peach bottom units and if approved  the current licenses would be extended by years  to and for units and respectively 
nrc review of the application is expected to take approximately two years 
in october  nuclear filed a complaint in the united states court of federal claims  along with a number of other plaintiffs  seeking million in relief from past overcharges by the doe for enrichment services 
no assurances can be given as to any claimed damage recovery 
low level radioactive waste llrw as a by product of their operations  nuclear generation units produce llrw 
such wastes include paper  plastics  protective clothing  water purification materials and other materials 
llrw materials are accumulated on site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities 
in  new jersey  connecticut and south carolina formed the atlantic compact 
this arrangement gives new jersey nuclear generators  including power  continued access to the barnwell llrw disposal facility which is owned by south carolina 
power believes that the atlantic compact will provide for adequate llrw disposal for salem and hope creek through the end of their current licenses  although no assurances can be given 
both power and exelon have on site llrw storage facilities for peach bottom  salem and hope creek which have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility 
uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund in accordance with the energy policy act epact  domestic entities that own nuclear generating stations are required to pay into a decontamination and decommissioning fund  based on their past purchases of us government enrichment services 
since these amounts are being collected from pse g s customers over a period of years  this obligation remained with pse g following the generation asset transfer to power in pse g s obligation for the nuclear generating stations in which it had an interest is million adjusted for inflation 
as of december   million has been paid  resulting in a balance due of million 
pse g and power believe that they should not be subject to collection of any such fund payments under the epact 
along with a number of other nuclear generator owners  power and pse g have filed suit in the us court of claims and in the us district court  southern district of ny to recover these costs

corporate structure we are a holding company and  as such  have no operations of our own 
we have four principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries public service electric and gas company pse g  pseg power llc power  pseg energy holdings inc energy holdings and pseg services corporation services 
pse g is an operating public utility company engaged principally in the transmission  distribution and sale of electric energy and gas service in new jersey 
on august   pursuant to the terms of the final order issued by the new jersey board of public utilities bpu  pse g transferred its generation related assets and liabilities and its wholesale power contracts to power and its subsidiaries in exchange for a promissory note in an amount equal to the total purchase price of billion 
power paid the promissory note on january  at which time the transferred assets were released from the lien of pse g s first and refunding mortgage 
pse g continues to own and operate its regulated electric and gas transmission and distribution business 
a bankruptcy remote subsidiary of pse g  pse g transition funding llc  issued billion of securitization bonds in january of in partial recovery of pse g s stranded cost resulting from new jersey deregulation and restructuring 
an additional million of pse g s stranded costs is being recovered from its customers over a four year transition period ending july  through a market transition charge mtc 
power was formed in june to acquire  own and operate the electric generation related assets of pse g pursuant to the final order issued by the bpu under the new jersey energy master plan energy master plan proceedings and the new jersey electric discount and energy competition act energy competition act 
power has three principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries pseg nuclear llc nuclear  pseg fossil llc fossil and pseg energy resources trade llc er t and currently operates in two reportable segments  generation and trading 
the generation segment of power s business earns revenues by selling energy on a wholesale basis under contract to power marketers and to load serving entities  and by bidding energy  capacity and ancillary services into the market 
the energy trading segment of power s business earns revenues by trading energy  capacity  fixed transmission rights  fuel and emission allowances in the spot  forward and futures markets 
the trading segment also earns revenues through financial transactions  including swaps  options and futures in the electricity and gas markets 
power also has a finance company subsidiary  pseg power capital investment co 
power capital  which provides certain financing for its other subsidiaries 
energy holdings participates in three energy related reportable segments through its principal wholly owned subsidiaries pseg global inc global  which develops  acquires  owns and operates electric generation and distribution facilities  pseg resources inc resources  which provides energy infrastructure financing and invests in energy related financial transactions and manages a diversified portfolio of investments including leveraged leases  operating leases  leveraged buyout lbo funds  limited partnerships and marketable securities  and pseg energy technologies inc energy technologies  an energy management company that constructs  operates and maintains heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac systems for  and provides energy related engineering  consulting and mechanical contracting services to  industrial and commercial customers in the northeastern and middle atlantic united states 
energy holdings also has a finance subsidiary  pseg capital corporation pseg capital  which serves as a financing vehicle for energy holdings subsidiaries and borrows on the basis of a minimum net worth maintenance agreement with pseg 
see liquidity and capital resources for further detail 
energy holdings is also the parent of enterprise group development corporation egdc  a property management business and is conducting a controlled exit from this business 
public service enterprise group incorporated services was formed in and provides management and administrative services to us and our subsidiaries 
overview of and future outlook the energy competition act and the related bpu proceedings  including the final order and the energy master plan proceedings  have dramatically reshaped the utility industry in new jersey and have directly affected how we will conduct business  and therefore  our financial prospects in the future 
deregulation  restructuring  privatization and consolidation are creating opportunities and risks for us and our subsidiaries 
we have realigned our organizational structure to address the competitive environment brought about by the deregulation of the electric generation industry in new jersey and the eastern u 
s and have transitioned from primarily being a regulated new jersey utility to a operating as a competitive global energy company 
we have been engaged in the competitive energy business for a number of years through certain of our unregulated subsidiaries  however  competitive businesses now constitute a much larger portion of our activities 
as of december   power  pse g  and energy holdings comprised approximately  and of pseg s consolidated assets and contributed approximately  and of our net income for the year ended december  our projected earnings contributions for and are to from power  to from energy holdings and to from pse g 
additionally  we will be more dependent on cash flows generated from our unregulated operations for our capital needs 
as the unregulated portion of the business continues to grow  financial risks and rewards will be greater  financial requirements will change and the volatility of earnings and cash flows will increase 
our subsidiaries consist of a portfolio of energy related businesses that together are designed to produce a coherent energy market strategy 
because the nature and risks of these businesses are different  and because they operate in different geographic locations  the combined entity is designed to produce consistent earnings growth in a manner that will mitigate the adverse financial effects of business losses or an economic downturn is any one sector or geographic region 
for  we earned per share 
our improved earnings for as compared to were due primarily to new acquisitions  asset sales and improved operations at global  new leveraged lease investments at resources  continued strong performance of our nuclear generating facilities and improved performance of our energy trading operations  which saw an increase in margins from million in to million in these improvements more than offset the effects of comparatively unfavorable weather conditions  two bpu mandated rate reductions  effective in february and august  and the effects of the securitization transaction that occurred on january  we estimate a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share over the next five years 
our earnings for will depend on several factors  including our ability to effectively manage our commitments under contracts to deliver energy  capacity and ancillary services to the various suppliers of bgs to new jersey s utilities and our ability to minimize the effects  including potential asset impairments  brought about by the economic  political and social crisis in argentina  where we face considerable fiscal and cash uncertainties 
for further discussion of our million investment exposure in argentina  see note commitments and contingent liabilities 
looking beyond  our earnings will depend on the outcome of future bgs auctions in new jersey  energy prices  which are currently depressed  in the united states markets in which power and global participate  the successful operation of our generation stations  pse g s ability to obtain timely and adequate rate relief  regulatory decisions affecting our interests in distribution companies in south america  and the effect of economic conditions in foreign countries in which we invest 
pse g pse g operates under cost based regulation by the bpu for its distribution operations and by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for its electric transmission operations 
as such  the earnings of pse g are largely determined by the regulation of its rates 
pse g is expected to continue to make a steady contribution to earnings in the future as it continues its transmission and distribution and sale of electric energy and gas service in new jersey 
pse g s success will be determined by its ability to maintain system reliability and safety  effectively manage costs and obtain timely and adequate rate relief 
the risks from this business are relatively modest and generally relate to the regulatory treatment of the various rate and other issues by the bpu and the ferc 
on january  the bpu approved an additional million of gas base rate revenues for pse g  simultaneously with other pse g rate filings related to underrecovered gas costs which were deferred on its balance sheet 
all three rate changes were effective january  also on january   the bpu approved the transfer of the utility s gas supply business  including its transportation and storage contracts  to power 
as a result  after april   power will provide gas supply to pse g to serve its basic gas supply service bgss customers under a requirements contract at market prices 
industrial and commercial bgss customers will be priced under pse g s market priced gas service mpgs and residential bgss customers will remain under current pricing until april  after which  subject to further bpu approval  those residential gas customers would also move to mpgs service 
on february   the bpu announced the successful outcome of the bgs auction 
through the auction  pse g contracted for sufficient electricity to serve all of its bgs customers and any difference between the existing tariff rates and the rates set through the auction for the one year contract period beginning august  will be deferred and recovered over future periods as a regulatory asset 
power power is focused on a generation market extending from maine to the carolinas and the atlantic coast to indiana super region 
the risks of power s business are that the competitive wholesale power prices that it is able to obtain are sufficient to provide a profit and sustain the value of its assets 
it is also subject to credit risk of the counterparties to whom it sells energy products  the successful operation of its generating facilities  fluctuations in market prices of energy and imbalances between obligations and available supply 
these risks are higher than those for a regulated business 
therefore  they provide the opportunity for greater returns  but they also present the greater possibility of business losses and counterparty credit risk 
power is currently constructing projects which will increase capacity by over  mw  net of planned retirements 
power currently sells approximately of the output from its generation facilities under bilateral contracts  primarily the bgs contract with pse g  and the remaining to customers in the competitive wholesale spot market 
within the spot market  power sells into the energy  capacity and ancillary services markets 
ancillary services include operating reserves and area regulation 
power has entered into one year contracts commencing august  with various direct bidders in the new jersey bgs auction  which was approved by the bpu on february  power believes that its obligations under these contracts are reasonably balanced by its available supply 
in addition  we anticipate that power will continue its strong growth in its energy trading segment 
in  the energy trading business realized a gross margin of million and forecasts an improvement for  primarily driven by the transfer of pse g s gas supply business to power  discussed below 
we marked to market energy trading contracts with gains and losses included in earnings 
the vast majority of these contracts have terms of less than one year and are valued using market exchange prices and broker quotes 
the energy trading business provides the opportunity for greater returns  but it also is more risky than the regulated business  and can be adversely impacted by fluctuating energy market prices and by the credit quality of the counterparties with which it does business 
our trading business utilizes a conservative risk management strategy to minimize exposure to credit risk 
for further information  see accounting issues  note organizationa and summary of significant accounting policies and note financial instruments  energy trading and risk management 
energy holdings energy holdings is a major part of our growth strategy 
in order to achieve this strategy  global will focus on generation and distribution investments within targeted high growth regions 
resources will utilize its market access  industry knowledge and transaction structuring capabilities to expand its energy related financial investment public service enterprise group incorporated portfolio 
we are evaluating the future prospects of energy technologies business model and its fit in our portfolio given the slower pace of retail deregulation in the markets in which we operate 
resources assets generate cash flow and earnings in the near term  while investments at global generally have a longer time horizon before achieving expected cash flow and earnings 
also  resources passive lower risk assets serve to balance the higher risk associated with operating assets at global and energy technologies 
global s more recent activities have been concentrated on developing generation internationally and in acquiring distribution businesses  principally in south america  that have been privatized by the local governments 
as global has grown  its objective has evolved from being a minority or equal partner to seeking to be the majority or sole owner of many of its investments 
global s business depends on the ability to negotiate or obtain favorable prices and terms for the output of its generating facilities nationally and internationally  and to obtain favorable governmental and regulatory treatment for its distribution assets in foreign countries 
global undertakes investments where the expected return is commensurate with the market  regulatory  international and currency risks that are inherent with its investments 
since these risks are priced in the original investment decision  to the extent that market  regulatory international or currency conditions evolve differently than originally forecast  the investment performance of global s assets will differ form the expected performance 
thus  the expected investment returns from global s projects are priced to produce relatively high returns to compensate for the high level of risk associated with this business 
global has investment exposure of million in four distribution companies and two generation plants in argentina 
for further discussion of our million investment exposure in argentina  see note commitments and contingent liabilities 
resources invests principally in energy related financing transactions  principally leveraged leases 
as such  it is designed to produce predictable earnings at reasonable levels with relatively low risk 
the modest risks faced by resources are the credit risk of its counterparties and the tax treatment of its investment structures 
resources earnings and cash flow streams are dependent upon the availability of and its ability to continue to enter into these transactions 
energy technologies is a business that principally constructs and installs heating  ventilating and air conditioning equipment and related services 
it has not produced profitable operations due to the extremely competitive nature of the business and the failure of the retail energy market to develop 
the principal risks of this business are to be able to reduce internal costs to become profitable in this market and to obtain revenues to cover the carrying value of its assets 
results of operations our business consists of six reportable segments which are generation  energy trading  pse g  global  resources and energy technologies 
the following is a discussion of the major year to year financial statement variances and follows the financial statement presentation as it relates to each of our segments 
the presentation of electric revenues and electric energy costs includes power s generation business  the electric transmission and distribution business of pse g and the consolidated portions of global s operations  gas revenues and gas costs includes the gas distribution business of pse g  trading revenues and costs includes power s energy trading business  and other revenues includes global s unconsolidated operations  resources and energy technologies 
prior to  energy technologies had certain electric and gas costs which were included in electric energy costs and gas costs  respectively 
for a discussion of management s determination of our reportable segments and related disclosures  see note financial reporting by business segments 
prior to april  the discussion that follows reports on business conducted under full monopoly regulation of the utility businesses 
it must be understood that such businesses have changed due to the deregulation of the electric generation and natural gas commodity sales businesses  the subsequent transfer of the generation business  and the anticipated transfer of the gas supply business from pse g to power

in addition  our improved earnings for as compared to resulted from improved performance from our energy trading segment  global s withdrawal and sale of its interest in the eagle point cogeneration partnership eagle point  acquisitions and expanded operations at global  new leveraged lease investments at resources and continued strong performance of our nuclear facilities 
these improvements more than offset the effects of unfavorable weather conditions at pse g  two bpu mandated rate reductions effective in february and august which reduced generation revenues  and the effects of the securitization transaction that occurred on january  public service enterprise group incorporated operating revenues electric electric revenues increased million or in as compared to primarily due to the inclusion of million of revenues related to various majority owned acquisitions and plants going into operation at our global segment in in addition  revenues from our generation segment increased million in as compared to primarily due to an increase of million in bgs revenue for the year ended december  as compared to which resulted from customers returning to pse g in from third party suppliers tps as wholesale market prices exceeded fixed bgs rates 
at december   tps were serving less than of the customer load traditionally served by pse g as compared to the december  level of 
partially offsetting this increase was a net million decrease in mtc revenues  relating to two rate reductions offset by a pre tax charge to income related to mtc recovery in as of december   as required by the final order  pse g has had rate reductions totaling since august  and will have an additional rate reduction effective august   which will be in effect until july  the remaining million of the increase related to the pse g segment and was primarily related to increases in electric distribution and appliance service revenue 
gas distribution in our pse g segment  gas distribution revenues increased million or in as compared to primarily due to higher gas costs experienced in customer rates in all classes of business have increased in to recover a portion of the higher natural gas costs 
the commercial and industrial classes fuel recovery rates vary monthly according to the market price of gas 
the bpu also approved increases in the fuel component of the residential class rates of in november and for each month from december through july these increased revenues were partially offset by lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of than the comparable period in  primarily resulting from warmer weather 
pursuant to a settlement  the bpu issued an order approving a million gas base rate increase effective january  the bpu approved the settlement simultaneously with the implementation of pse g s previously approved gas cost underrecovery adjustment gcua surcharge to recover its october  gas cost under recovery balance of approximately million over a three year period with interest and also approved pse g s proposal to reduce its commodity charges formerly levelized gas adjustment clause lgac by approximately million 
the net impact of simultaneously implementing the above three proceedings for the typical gas residential heating customers is an approximate rate reduction of 
trading revenues from our energy trading segment decreased by million or for the year ended december  from the comparable periods in  respectively  due to lower energy trading volumes and lower prices as compared to for information regarding valuation  term  credit and other issues related to power s energy trading segment  see accounting issues  note organization and summary of significant accounting policies and note financial instruments  energy trading and risk management of notes 
other other revenues increased million or in as compared to this increase was due to an increase in revenues at the global  resources and energy technologies segments of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase at global was primarily realized from the gain of million on the withdrawal and sale of global s interest in eagle point and was partially offset by a loss in equity earnings of million  which was recorded in and not recorded in  as a result of the withdrawal 
in addition  revenues benefited from an increase of million in public service enterprise group incorporated interest income related to certain loans  notes and approximately million of increased revenues relating primarily to improved earnings of certain non consolidated projects 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues due to a reduction in earnings related to the adverse effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements between the united states dollar and brazilian real 
the increase at resources was primarily due to improved revenues of million from higher leveraged lease income from new leveraged lease transactions that was partially offset by lower net investment gains of million 
the increase at energy technologies was primarily due to increased sales in its mechanical contracting business partially offset by a decrease of energy supply revenues 
operating expenses electric energy costs electric energy costs increased million or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to million of electric energy costs relating to the various majority owned acquisitions and projects going into operation at global in  higher costs in our generation segment associated with increased load served under the bgs contract due to retail customers returning to pse g in as discussed previously  and higher fuel costs of million for fossil generation from higher natural gas prices in the early part of and higher gas expense due to increased mmbtu usage 
these increases were partially offset by low cost generation from the continued strong performance of our nuclear generation facilities 
gas costs gas costs increased million or in as compared to due to higher natural gas prices at our pse g segment in the early part of under the lgac in pse g  underrecoveries or overrecoveries  together with interest in the case of net overrecoveries  are deferred and included in operations in the period in which they are reflected in rates 
these increases were partially offset by lower costs incurred at energy technologies due to the outsourcing of certain supply contracts since june under its retail gas service agreements 
trading costs energy trading costs decreased million or in compared to  primarily due to lower energy trading volumes and lower prices 
operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased million or in as compared to contributing to the increase were higher operating expenses relating to various majority owned acquisitions and new plants going into operation at global in additionally  operation and maintenance expenses increased due to planned generation outage work in the first quarter of and higher expenses relating to projects going into operation during the second quarter of for our generation segment and the deferral of costs incurred during in connection with deregulation that pse g expects to recover in future rates 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or in as compared to the increase was due primarily due to million of amortization of the regulatory asset recorded for pse g s stranded costs  which commenced with the issuance of the transition bonds  previously discussed 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the accrual for the estimated cost of removal in our generation segment 
public service enterprise group incorporated taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million or in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the net taxable transitional energy facility assessment tefa sales and the scheduled phase out of the tefa 
the tefa was enacted as part of the energy tax reform bill and was scheduled to be phased out by recent legislation delayed the phase out until interest expense interest expense increased million or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increased debt associated with the issuance of billion securitization bonds by transition funding and the issuance of billion of senior notes by power to finance the generation asset transfer 
these increases were offset by a general reduction in the amount of short term and long term debt at pseg and pse g using proceeds from securitization bonds 
interest expense at energy holdings increased million primarily from additional borrowings used for equity investments in global and resources 
preferred securities dividend requirements of subsidiaries preferred securities dividend requirements decreased million or in as compared to due to redemption of trust preferred securities 
income taxes income taxes decreased million or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower pre tax income and normal adjustments as a result of closing the audit for the tax years and upon filing our actual tax return for for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the million  net of tax  extraordinary charge recorded in  resulting from the deregulation of our generation segment  basic and diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december  as compared to  including of accretion as a result of our stock repurchase program 
for further discussion  see note regulatory issues and accounting impacts of deregulation of notes 
this increase was primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization resulting from the amortization of the excess depreciation reserve at our pse g segment beginning in january and the lower depreciation resulting from the lower recorded amounts of the generation related assets in our generation segment resulting from the impairment recorded pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
also contributing to the increase were increased sales due to favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of and higher profits realized from our energy trading segment 
in addition  better overall performance of our global segment  which benefited from favorable performance by its domestic generation assets and by its investments made in south america distribution assets in  contributed to the increase 
the increase in earnings was partially offset by the electric rate reduction  beginning august  coupled with a charge to income in the third quarter of related to mtc recovery at our generation segment 
operating revenues electric electric revenues decreased million or in as compared to due to a decrease in revenues from our generation segment primarily relating to the rate reduction  which decreased our revenues by approximately million combined with a million deferral of mtc revenues  and reduced retail demand as pse g lost retail customers to tps which amounted to approximately million 
see accounting issues accounting for the effects of regulation for a discussion of the deferral of mtc revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from our pse g segment relating to higher transmission and distribution sales

under these contracts  pse g is responsible only for delivery of gas to its customers 
such customers are responsible for payment to pse g for the cost of the commodity and as pse g s costs for these customers increase  the customer s rates will increase 
also contributing to this increase were higher sales resulting from colder weather in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in and higher rates approved by the bpu to allow pse g to recover for increasing natural gas costs 
trading energy trading revenues increased million or for the year ended december  from the comparable period in primarily due to increased energy trading volumes 
other other revenues increased million or in as compared to the increase was due to an increase of million at resources due to higher leveraged lease income from new leveraged lease investments  and increases in revenue at energy technologies due to the addition of revenues from acquisitions of various hvac companies in and these increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenues of million at global primarily due to a gain on sale of newark bay recorded in as compared to no significant gain on sale of assets in operating expenses electric energy costs electric energy costs increased million or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs in our generation segment and additional costs related to projects at our global and energy technologies segments 
due to the elimination of the leac on august   the historical trends can no longer be considered an indication of future electric energy costs 
given the elimination of the leac  the lifting of the requirements that electric energy offered for sale in the pennsylvania new jersey maryland power pool pjm regional pool not exceed the variable cost of producing such energy capped at  per megawatt hour  the absence of a pjm price cap in situations involving emergency purchases and the potential for plant outages  price movements could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or net cash flows 
gas costs gas costs increased million or in as compared to primarily due to the higher prices for natural gas and increased demand for natural gas at our pse g segment due to colder weather in the fourth quarter public service enterprise group incorporated of as compared to the same period in this increase was partially offset by the outsourcing of certain supply contracts at energy technologies in june  as discussed previously 
due to the operation of the levelized gas adjustment clause lgac mechanism  variances in gas revenues and costs at pse g offset and had no direct effect on earnings 
trading costs energy trading costs increased million or for the year ended december  from the comparable period primarily due to increased energy trading volumes 
operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased million or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the addition of million in operating expenses from the hvac and mechanical service contracting companies acquired by energy technologies in and the increase was partially offset by the effects of a million pre tax charge to earnings to reduce the carrying value of certain assets at global and egdc in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the amortization of the regulatory liability for the excess electric distribution depreciation reserve at pse g  which amounted to approximately million as of december  also contributing to the decrease was lower depreciation resulting from the lower net book value balances of the generation related assets in our generation segment 
the generation related asset balances were reduced as of april  as a result of the impairment recorded pursuant to sfas taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes  which include tefa  decreased million or in as compared to due to new jersey energy tax reform and the five year commencing in january effective january   revised rates became effective which reflected two years phase out of the tefa discussed previously 
interest expense interest expense increased million or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with recourse financing activities at energy holdings which increased million from additional borrowings incurred as a result of equity investments in distribution and generation facilities and the repayment of non recourse debt 
also contributing to the increase was the interest related to higher levels of short term debt 
income taxes income taxes decreased million or in as compared to the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the foreign tax liability from foreign investments at global recorded under the equity method 
under such accounting method  global reflects in revenues its pro rata share of investments net income 
under this accounting method  the foreign income taxes are a component of equity in earnings  thereby distorting the effective tax rate downward 
during  there was an increase in state income taxes at resources totaling million due to the early termination of a leveraged lease 
the decrease was also due to lower effective tax rates relating to the amortization of the excess depreciation reserve for electric distribution 
public service enterprise group incorporated liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis  noting the uses and contributions of our three direct operating subsidiaries in  pse g  power and energy holdings 
our capital requirements and those of our subsidiaries are met and liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings 
pseg  power and energy holdings from time to time make equity contributions to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements  generally relating to long term investments 
at times  we utilize inter company dividends and inter company loans to satisfy various subsidiary needs and efficiently manage our and our subsidiaries short term cash needs 
any excess funds are invested in accordance with guidelines adopted by our board of directors 
external funding to meet our needs and the needs of pse g  the majority of the requirements of power and a substantial portion of the requirements of energy holdings  is comprised of corporate finance transactions 
the debt incurred is the direct obligation of those respective entities 
some of the proceeds of these debt transactions are used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries 
all of our publicly traded debt as well as that of pse g  power and energy holdings have received investment grade ratings from each of the three major credit rating agencies 
the changes in the energy industry and the recent bankruptcy of enron corp 
are attracting increased attention from the rating agencies which regularly assess business and financial matters 
given the changes in the industry  attention to and scrutiny of our  pse g s  power s and energy holdings performance  capital structure and competitive strategies by rating agencies will likely continue 
these changes could affect the bond ratings  cost of capital and market prices of our respective securities 
we will continue to evaluate our capital structure  financing requirements  competitive strategies and future capital expenditures to maintain our current credit ratings 
the current ratings of securities of pseg and its subsidiaries are shown below and reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from whom an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely effect the market price of pseg s  energy holdings powers and pse g s securities and serve to increase those companies cost of capital

some of these transactions involve special purpose entities 
these are corporations  limited liability companies or partnerships formed in accordance with applicable tax  accounting and legal requirements in order to achieve specified beneficial financial advantages  such as favorable tax  legal liability or accounting treatment 
public service enterprise group incorporated the availability and cost of external capital could be affected by each subsidiary s performance as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates 
this could include the degree of structural or regulatory separation between us and our subsidiaries and between pse g and its non utility affiliates and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality 
additionally  compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial position and levels of earnings and net cash flows  as to which no assurances can be given 
financing for global s projects and investments is generally provided by non recourse project financing transactions 
these consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project and special purpose subsidiary assets and or cash flows 
two of power s projects currently under construction have similar financing 
non recourse transactions generally impose no obligation on the parent level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower 
however  in some cases  certain obligations relating to the investment being financed  including additional equity commitments  are guaranteed by global  energy holdings  and or power 
further  the consequences of permitting a project level default include loss of any invested equity by the parent 
our debt indentures and credit agreements and those of our subsidiaries contain cross default provisions under which a default by us or by specified subsidiaries involving specified levels of indebtedness in other agreements would result in a default and the potential acceleration of payment under such indentures and credit agreements 
for example  a default for a specified amount with respect to any indebtedness of global and power  as set forth in various credit agreements  including obligations in non recourse transactions  could cause a cross default in one of our or our subsidiaries credit agreements 
such lenders  or the debt holders under any of our or our subsidiaries indentures  could determine that debt payment obligations may be accelerated as a result of a cross default 
these occurrences could severely limit our liquidity and restrict our ability to meet our debt  capital and  in extreme cases  operational cash requirements 
any inability to satisfy required covenants and or borrowing conditions would have a similar impact 
this would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and net cash flows  and those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit agreements and those of our subsidiaries generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in the borrower s  and as may be relevant  our  energy holdings  power s or pse g s business or financial condition 
in the event that we or the lenders in any of our or our subsidiaries credit agreements determine that a material adverse change has occurred  loan funds may not be advanced 
some of these credit agreements also contain maximum debt to equity ratios  minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing 
compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position and the level of earnings and cash flow  as to which no assurances can be given 
as part of our financial planning forecast  we perform stress tests on our financial covenants 
these tests include a consideration of the impacts of potential asset impairments  foreign currency fluctuations  and other items 
our current analyses and projections indicate that  even in a worst case scenario with respect to our investments in argentina and considering other potential events  we will still be able to meet our financial covenants 
our debt indentures and credit agreements and those of our subsidiaries do not contain any ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
however  in the event of a downgrade we and or our subsidiaries may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt 
also  in connection with its energy trading business  power must meet certain credit quality standards as are required by counterparties 
if power loses its investment grade credit rating  er t would have to provide credit support letters of credit or cash  which would significantly impact the energy trading business 
these same contracts provide reciprocal benefits to power 
global and energy holdings may have to provide collateral for certain of their equity commitments if energy holdings ratings should fall below investment grade 
this would increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to successfully conduct our energy trading operations 
in addition  our counterparties may require us to meet margin or other security requirements which may include cash payments 
capital resources and investment requirements could be affected by the outcome of proceedings by the bpu pursuant to its energy master plan and energy competition act and the requirements of the focused audit public service enterprise group incorporated conducted by the bpu  of the impact of our non utility businesses  owned by energy holdings  on pse g 
as a result of the focused audit  the bpu ordered that  among other things we will not permit energy holdings investments to exceed of our consolidated assets without prior notice to the bpu  pse g s board of directors would provide an annual certification that the business and financing plans of energy holdings will not adversely affect pse g we will a limit debt supported by the minimum net worth maintenance agreement between us and pseg capital to million and b make a good faith effort to eliminate such support over a six to ten year period from may  and energy holdings will pay pse g an affiliation fee of up to million a year which is to be used to reduce customer rates 
in the final order the bpu noted that  due to significant changes in the industry and  in particular  our corporate structure as a result of the final order  modifications to or relief from the focused audit order might be warranted 
pse g has notified the bpu that pseg will eliminate pseg capital debt by the end of and that it believes that the final order otherwise supercedes the requirements of the focused audit 
while we believe that this issue will be satisfactorily resolved  no assurances can be given 
in addition  if we were no longer to be exempt under the public utility holding company act of puhca  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to additional regulation by the sec with respect to financing and investing activities  including the amount and type of non utility investments 
we believe that this would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and net cash flows 
over the next several years  we and our subsidiaries will be required to refinance maturing debt  incur additional debt and provide equity to fund investment activity 
any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and or existing agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may affect our financial condition  results of operations and net cash flows 
we and our subsidiaries have the following credit facilities for various funding purposes and to provide liquidity for our million commercial program and pse g s million commercial paper program 
these agreements are with a group of banks and provide for borrowings with maturities of up to one year 
the following table summarizes our various facilities as of december  commercial maturity total primary amount paper cp company date facility purpose outstanding outstanding millions of dollars pseg day credit facility march cp support year credit facility march cp support n a year credit facility december funding n a bilateral credit agreement n a no limit funding n a pse g day credit facility june cp support year credit facility june cp support bilateral credit agreement june cp support bilateral credit agreement n a no limit funding n a energy holdings day credit facility may funding n a year credit facility may funding n a bilateral credit agreement n a funding n a total n a pseg as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of common stock  at a cost of approximately million since the repurchased shares have primarily been public service enterprise group incorporated held as treasury stock with the balance used for general corporate purposes 
dividend payments on common stock were per share and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our dividend rate has remained constant since in order to retain additional capital for reinvestment and to reduce the payout ratio as earnings grow 
although we presently believe we will have adequate earnings and cash flow in the future from our subsidiaries to maintain common stock dividends at the current level  earnings and cash flows required to support the dividend will become more volatile as our business continues to change from one that is principally regulated to one that is principally competitive 
future dividends declared will necessarily be dependent upon our future earnings  cash flows  financial requirements  alternate investment opportunities and other factors 
we have issued deferrable interest subordinated debentures in connection with the issuance of tax deductible preferred securities 
if payments on these deferrable interest subordinated debentures are deferred  in accordance with their terms  pseg may not pay any dividends on its common stock until such default is cured 
currently  there has been no deferral or default 
financial covenants contained in our facilities include the ratio of debt excluding non recourse project financings and securitization debt and including commercial paper and loans to total capitalization

as of december   letters of credit were issued in the amount of approximately million 
in april  power issued million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million senior notes due the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used primarily for the repayment of loans from us 
in august  subsidiaries of power closed on million of non recourse project bank financing for projects in waterford  ohio and lawrenceburg  indiana 
the total combined project cost for waterford and lawrenceburg is estimated at billion 
power s required estimated equity investment in these projects is approximately million 
in connection with these projects  er t has entered into a five year tolling agreement pursuant to which it is obligated to purchase the output of these facilities at stated prices 
as a result  er t will bear the price risk related to the output of these generation facilities which are scheduled to be completed in in the fourth quarter of  power issued million in pollution control notes 
public service enterprise group incorporated energy holdings as of december   energy holdings had two separate senior revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks as discussed in the table above 
the five year facility permits up to million of letters of credit to be issued of which million are outstanding as of december  financial covenants contained in these facilities include the ratio of cash flow available for debt service cfads to fixed charges 
at the end of any quarterly financial period such ratio shall not be less than x for the month period then ending 
as a condition of borrowing  the pro forma cfads to fixed charges ratio shall not be less than x as of the quarterly financial period ending immediately following the first anniversary of each borrowing or letter of credit issuance 
cfads includes  but is not limited to  operating cash before interest and taxes  pre tax cash distributions from all asset liquidations and equity capital contributions from us to the extent not used to fund investing activity 
in addition  the ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to recourse capitalization  as at the end of any quarterly financial period  shall not be greater than to 
this ratio is calculated by dividing the total recourse indebtedness of energy holdings by the total recourse capitalization 
this ratio excludes the debt of pseg capital  which is supported by us 
as of december   the latest months cfads coverage ratio was and the ratio of recourse indebtedness to recourse capitalization was 
to pseg capital has a million mtn program which provides for the private placement of mtns 
this mtn program is supported by a minimum net worth maintenance agreement between pseg capital and us which provides  among other things  that we maintain its ownership  directly or indirectly  of all outstanding common stock of pseg capital  cause pseg capital to have at all times a positive tangible net worth of at least  and make sufficient contributions of liquid assets to pseg capital in order to permit it to pay its debt obligations 
we believe that we are capable of eliminating our support of pseg capital debt within the time period set forth in the focused audit 
in october  million of mtns matured and were refinanced with funds from the issuance of short term debt at energy holdings 
at december  and december   total debt outstanding under the mtn program was million and million  respectively maturing from to in february  energy holdings sold million of senior notes due and in july  sold million of senior notes due the net proceeds were used to repay short term debt outstanding from intercompany loans and borrowings under energy holdings revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes

the debt is variable and is based on libor 
in connection with this project financing  pseg chile holdings entered into two foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a total notional amount of million 
the two contracts were entered into to hedge the peso united states dollar exposure on the net investment 
public service enterprise group incorporated capital requirements for the year ended december   we made net plant additions of billion  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afdc and capitalized interest 
the majority of these additions  billion  primarily related to power for developing the lawrenceburg  indiana and the waterford  ohio sites and adding capacity to the bergen  linden  burlington and kearny stations in new jersey 
in addition  pse g had net plant additions of million related to improvements in its transmission and distribution system  gas system and common facilities 
also in  energy holdings subsidiaries made investments totaling approximately billion 
these investments included leveraged lease investments totaling million by resources and new acquisitions by global and additional investments in existing domestic and international facilities 
forecasted expenditures our subsidiaries have substantial commitments as part of their growth strategies and ongoing construction programs 
we expect that the majority of each subsidiaries capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds  with the balance to be provided by the issuance of debt at the subsidiary or project level and equity contributions from us 
projected construction and investment expenditures for our subsidiaries for the next five years are as follows millions of dollars power energy holdings pse g total      for a discussion of new generation and development and other commitments to purchase equipment and services  all of which are included in our forecasts above  see note commitments and contingent liabilities power s capital needs will be dictated by its strategy to continue to develop as a profitable  growth oriented supplier in the wholesale power market 
power will size its fleet of generation assets to take advantage of market opportunities  while seeking to increase its value and manage commodity price risk through its wholesale energy trading activity 
a significant portion of power s projected investment expenditures in the latter part of this forecast are not yet committed to specific projects 
public service enterprise group incorporated energy holdings plans to continue the growth of global and resources 
the majority of energy holdings projected investment expenditures are not yet committed to specific projects 
investment activity is subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending upon the opportunities presented 
pse g s construction expenditures are primarily to maintain the safety and reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities 
factors affecting our subsidiaries actual expenditures and investments  including ongoing construction programs  include availability of capital  suitable investment opportunities  prices of energy and supply in markets in which we participate  economic and political trends  revised load forecasts  business strategies  site changes  cost escalations under construction contracts  requirements of regulatory authorities and laws  and the timing of and amount of electric and gas transmission and or distribution rate changes

less total amounts than contractual cash obligations committed year years years over years millions of dollars long term debt      capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations      we  power  and energy holdings have guaranteed certain obligations of affiliates  including the successful completion  performance or other obligations and have contract equity contribution obligations related to certain projects in an aggregate amount of approximately million  as of december  a substantial portion of such guarantees is eliminated upon successful completion  performance and or refinancing of construction debt with non recourse project term debt 
in the normal course of business  energy technologies secures construction obligations with performance bonds issued by insurance companies 
in the event that energy technologies tangible equity falls below million  energy holdings would be required to provide additional support for the performance bonds

the performance bonds are not included in the table below 
total less amounts than other commercial commitments committed year years years over years millions of dollars standby letters of credit guarantees and equity commitments total commercial commitments off balance sheet arrangements global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
accordingly  an amount is recorded on our balance sheet which is primarily energy holdings equity investment and is increased for energy holdings pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments 
the companies in which we invest that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate billion of debt on their combined  consolidated financial statements 
our pro rata share of such debt is million and is non recourse to us  energy holdings and global 
we are generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies 
however  default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity 
public service enterprise group incorporated resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with sfas accounting for leases 
leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties an owner lessor  a creditor  and a lessee 
in a typical leveraged lease financing  the lessor purchases an asset to be leased 
the purchase price is typically financed with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by resources 
the creditor provides long term financing to the transaction  and is secured by the property subject to lease 
such long term financing is non recourse to resources 
as such  in the event of default the creditor may only look to the leased asset as security for his loan 
as a lessor  resources has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessee for use in its business operation 
as of december  resources equity investment in leased assets was approximately billion  net of deferred taxes of approximately billion 
in the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by the lessor is no longer reasonably predictable  the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change 
in such cases  resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation 
in many instances  resources has protected its equity investment in such transactions by providing for the direct right to assume the debt obligation 
debt assumption would be at resources sole discretion  and normally only would occur if an appraisal of the leased property yielded a value that exceeds the present value of the debt outstanding 
should resources ever directly assume a debt obligation  the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the balance sheet instead of the net equity investment in the lease 
in the events described above  the lease essentially changes from being classified as a capital lease to a conventional operating lease 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity security prices  and interest rates as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
our policy is to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with our business plans and prudent practices 
we have a risk management committee comprised of executive officers which utilizes an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices 
counterparties expose us to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment 
we have a credit management process which is used to assess  monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for us and our subsidiaries 
in the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty  there may be a material adverse impact on our and our subsidiaries financial condition  results of operations or net cash flows 
public service enterprise group incorporated foreign currencies the objective of our foreign currency risk management policy is to preserve the economic value of cash flows in non functional currencies 
toward this end  energy holdings policy is to hedge all significant firmly committed cash flows identified as creating foreign currency exposure 
in addition  we typically hedge a portion of exposure resulting from identified anticipated cash flows  providing the flexibility to deal with the variability of longer term forecasts as well as changing market conditions  in which the cost of hedging may be excessive relative to the level of risk involved 
as of december   global and resources had assets located or held in international locations of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
resources international investments are primarily leveraged leases of assets located in australia  austria  belgium  china  germany  the netherlands  the united kingdom  and new zealand with associated revenues denominated in united states dollars us and therefore  not subject to foreign currency risk 
global s international investments are primarily in companies that generate or distribute electricity in argentina  brazil  chile  china  india  italy  oman  peru  poland  taiwan  tunisia and venezuela 
investing in foreign countries involves certain additional risks 
economic conditions that result in higher comparative rates of inflation in foreign countries are likely to result in declining values in such countries currencies 
as currencies fluctuate against the us  there is a corresponding change in global s investment value in terms of the us 
such change is reflected as an increase or decrease in the investment value and other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholder s equity 
as of december   net foreign currency devaluations have reduced the reported amount of energy holdings total stockholder s equity by million after tax  of which million after tax was caused by the devaluation of the chilean peso and million after tax was caused by the devaluation of the brazilian real

these contracts expire in may  june and july as of december   global s share of the fair value and aggregate notional value of the contracts was approximately million 
these contracts were established as hedges for accounting purposes resulting in an after tax charge to other comprehensive income oci of approximately million 
in addition  in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the outstanding portion of the debt  global entered into a forward exchange contract in december to purchase united states dollars for brazilian reals in approximately their share of the total debt outstanding million 
the contract expired prior to december  and was not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes 
as a result of unfavorable movements in the united states dollars to brazilian real exchange rates  a loss of million  after tax was recorded related to this derivative upon maturity of the contract 
this amount was recorded in other income 
through its joint venture  meiya power company  global holds a ownership interest in a taiwanese generation project under construction where the construction contractor s fees  payable in installments through july  are payable in euros 
to manage the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations associated with these payments  the project entered into a series of forward exchange contracts to purchase euros in exchange for taiwanese dollars 
as of december   global s share of the fair value and aggregate notional value of these forward exchange contracts was approximately million and million  respectively

public service enterprise group incorporated during  global purchased approximately of a chilean distribution company 
in order to hedge final chilean peso denominated payments required to be made on the acquisition  global entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase chilean pesos for united states dollars 
this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting  and  as such  upon settlement of the transaction  global recognized an after tax loss of million 
furthermore  as a requirement to obtain certain debt financing necessary to fund the acquisition  and in order to hedge against fluctuations in the united states dollars to chilean peso foreign exchange rates  global entered into a forward contract with a notional value of million to exchange chilean pesos for united states dollars 
this transaction expires in october and is considered a hedge for accounting purposes 
as of december   the derivative asset value of million has been recorded to oci  net of taxes million 
in addition  global holds a interest in another chilean distribution company  which was anticipating paying its us investors a return of capital 
in order to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the chilean peso to us dollar exchange rate  the distribution company entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase united states dollars for chilean pesos 
global s after tax share of the loss on settlement of this transaction recorded by the distribution company was million 
in january  rge entered into a series of nine cross currency interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its exposure to fluctuations in the brazilian real to united states dollars exchange rates with respect to its united states dollars denominated debt principal payments due in through the instruments convert the variable libor based interest payments on the loan balance to variable cdi based interest payments 
cdi is the brazilian interbank interest rate 
as a result  the distribution company has hedged its foreign currency exposure but is still at risk for variability in the brazilian cdi interest rate during the terms of the instruments 
global s share of the notional value of the instruments is approximately million for the instruments maturing in may  june and july of through and approximately million for the instruments maturing in may  june and july also in january  the distribution company entered into two similar cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the united states dollar denominated interest payments due on the debt in february and may global s share of the notional value of these two instruments is approximately million each 
commodity contracts during  power entered into electric physical forward contracts and gas futures and swaps with a maximum term of approximately one year  to hedge our forecasted bgs requirements and gas purchases requirements for generation 
these transactions qualified for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and were settled prior to the end of the majority of the marked to market valuations were reclassified from oci to earnings during the quarter ended september  as of december   we did not have any outstanding derivatives accounted for under this methodology 
however  there was substantial activity during the year ended december  in  the values of these forward contracts  gas futures and swaps as of june and september were million and million 
also as of december   pse g had entered into mmbtu of gas futures  options and swaps to hedge forecasted requirements 
as of december   the fair value of those instruments was million with a maximum term of approximately one year 
pse g utilizes derivatives to hedge its gas purchasing activities which  when realized  are recoverable through its levelized gas adjustment clause lgac 
accordingly  these commodity contracts are recognized at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability 
the availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather  environmental policies  changes in supply and demand  state and federal regulatory policies and other events 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  we enter into derivative contracts  including forwards  futures  swaps and options with approved counterparties  to hedge our anticipated demand 
these contracts  in conjunction with owned electric generation capacity  are designed to cover estimated electric customer commitments 
we use a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of our commodity business 
this model includes fixed price sales commitments  owned generation  native load requirements  physical contracts and financial derivative instruments 
var represents the potential gains or losses for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
pseg estimates var across its commodity business using a model with historical volatilities and correlations 
the risk management committee rmc established a var threshold of million 
if this threshold was reached  the rmc would be notified and the portfolio would be closely monitored to reduce risk and potential adverse movements 
in anticipation of the completion of the current bgs contract with pse g on july   and the bgs auction  the var threshold was increased to million 
public service enterprise group incorporated the measured var using a variance co variance model with a confidence level and assuming a one week time horizon as of december  was approximately million  compared to the december  level of million 
this estimate was driven by our assumption that power would enter into contracts for approximately of its generating capacity during the bgs auction 
since power obtained contracts in excess of this amount  the var at december  would have been even lower 
this estimate  however  is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may differ due to the fact that actual market rate fluctuations may differ from forecasted fluctuations and due to the fact that the portfolio of hedging instruments may change over the holding period and due to certain assumptions embedded in the calculation 
interest rates pseg  pse g  power and energy holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
their policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt  interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements 
as of december   a hypothetical change in market interest rates would result in a million  million  and million  change in annual interest costs related to short term and floating rate debt at pseg  pse g  and energy holdings  respectively

as of december   there was a million balance remaining in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account  as indicated in the table above 
we have also entered into several interest rate swaps that were closed out during and are being amortized to earnings over the life of the underlying debt 
these items  along with their current and anticipated effect on earnings discussed below 
in february  we entered into various forward interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million  to hedge the interest rate risk related to the anticipated issuance of debt 
on april   power issued billion in fixed rate senior notes and closed out the forward starting interest rate swaps 
the aggregate loss  net of tax  of million was classified as accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized and charged to interest expense over the life of the debt 
during the year ended december   approximately million was reclassified from oci to earnings 
management expects it will amortize approximately million from oci to earnings during the next twelve months 
in march  million of non recourse bank debt originally incurred to fund a portion of the purchase price of global s interest in chilquinta energia  sa was refinanced

an extraordinary loss of million after tax was recorded in connection with the refinancing of the million non recourse bank debt 
public service enterprise group incorporated equity securities resources has investments in equity securities and limited partnerships 
resources carries its investments in equity securities at their approximate fair value as of the reporting date 
consequently  the carrying value of these investments is affected by changes in the fair value of the underlying securities 
fair value is determined by adjusting the market value of the securities for liquidity and market volatility factors  where appropriate 
the aggregate fair values of such investments  which had quoted market prices at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in quoted market prices of these investments amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
we have established credit policies that we believe significantly minimize credit risk 
these policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition including credit rating  collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements  which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty 
as a result of the bgs auction  power has contracted to provide generating capacity to the direct suppliers of new jersey electric utilities  including pse g  commencing august  these bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk 
this credit risk relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their payment obligations for the power delivered under each bgs contract 
this risk is substantially higher than the risk associated with potential nonpayment by pse g under the bgs contract expiring july  since pse g is a rate regulated entity 
any failure to collect these payments under the new bgs contracts could have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in december  enron corp 
enron filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
power had entered into a variety of energy trading contracts with enron and its affiliates in the pennsylvania new jersey maryland power pool pjm area as part of its energy trading activities 
we took proper steps to mitigate our exposures to both enron and other counterparties who could have been affected by enron 
as of december   we owed enron approximately million  net  and enron held a letter of credit from power for approximately million 
as a result of the california energy crisis  pacific gas electric company pg e filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on april  gwf  hanford and tracy had combined pre petition receivables due from pg e  for all plants amounting to approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million had been reserved as an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting in a net receivable balance of approximately million 
global s pro rata share of this gross receivable and net receivable was approximately million and million  respectively 
in december  gwf  hanford and tracy reached an agreement with pg e which stipulates that pg e will make full payment of the million in equal installments  including interest by the end of on december   pg e paid gwf million  representing the initial installment payment and all accrued interest due  pursuant to the agreement 
as of december   gwf  hanford and tracy still had combined pre petition receivables due from pg e for all plants amounting to approximately million

accounting issues critical accounting policies and other accounting matters our most critical accounting policies include the application of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas for pse g  our regulated public service enterprise group incorporated transmission and distribution business  emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  for our energy trading business  and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  to account for the various hedging transactions  and sfas  foreign currency translation and its impacts on global s foreign investments 
accounting for the effects of regulation pse g prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which differs in certain respects from the application of gaap by non regulated businesses 
in general  sfas recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs a regulatory asset or the recognition of obligations a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates 
accordingly  pse g has deferred certain costs  which will be amortized over various future periods 
to the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or pse g s competitive position  the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income 
as a result of new jersey deregulation legislation and regulatory orders issued by the bpu  certain regulatory assets and liabilities were recorded 
the amortization of two of these regulatory liabilities will have a significant effect on our annual earnings 
they include the estimated amount of mtc revenues to be collected in excess of the authorized amount of million and the amount of excess electric distribution depreciation reserves 
the amount of these regulatory liabilities will be amortized to earnings over the four year transition period from august  through july  the mtc was authorized by the bpu as an opportunity to recover up to million net of tax of our unsecuritized generation related stranded costs on a net present value basis 
as a result of the appellate reviews of the final order  pse g s securitization transaction was delayed until the first quarter of  causing a delay in the implementation of the securitization transition charge stc which would have reduced the mtc 
as a result  mtc was being recovered at a faster rate than intended under the final order and a significant overrecovery was probable 
in order to properly recognize the recovery of the allowed unsecuritized stranded costs over the transition period  pse g recorded a regulatory liability and power recorded a charge to net income of million  pre tax  or million  after tax  in the third quarter of for the cumulative amount of estimated collections in excess of the allowed unsecuritized stranded costs from august  through september  pse g then began deferring a portion of these revenues each month to recognize the estimated collections in excess of the allowed unsecuritized stranded costs 
as of december   this deferred amount was million and is aggregated with the societal benefits clause 
after deferrals  pre tax mtc revenues recognized were million in  million in  and million in in and  we expect to record approximately million and million  respectively 
the amortization of the excess depreciation reserve is another significant regulatory liability affecting our earnings 
as required by the bpu  pse g reduced its depreciation reserve for its electric distribution assets by million and recorded such amount as a regulatory liability to be amortized over the period from january  to july  in and  million was amortized and recorded as a reduction of depreciation expense pursuant to the final order 
the remaining million will be amortized through july  see note regulatory assets and liabilities of notes for further discussion of these and other regulatory issues 
accounting  valuation and presentation of our energy trading business accounting we account for our energy trading business in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
which requires that energy trading contracts be marked to market with gains and losses included in current earnings 
public service enterprise group incorporated valuation since the vast majority of our energy trading contracts have terms of less than one year  valuations for these contracts are readily obtainable from the market exchanges  such as pjm  and over the counter quotations 
the valuations also include a credit reserve and a liquidity reserve  which is determined using financial quotation systems  monthly bid ask prices and spread percentages 
we have consistently applied this valuation methodology for each reporting period presented 
the fair values of these contracts and a more detailed discussion of credit risk are reflected in note financial instruments  energy trading and risk management 
presentation eitf provided guidance on the issue of whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained 
the guidance states that whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed or the net retained requires significant judgment  which depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the analysis and interpretation of eitf  we report all of the energy trading revenues and energy trading related costs on a gross basis for physical bilateral energy and capacity sales and purchases 
we report swaps  futures  option premiums  firm transmission rights  transmission congestion credits  and purchases and sales of emission allowances on a net basis 
the prior year financial statements have been reclassified accordingly 
one of the primary drivers of our determination that these contracts should be presented on a gross basis was that we retain counterparty risk 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
in accordance with sfas  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in oci  net of tax  or as a regulatory asset liability 
amounts in accumulated oci are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs 
the change in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in earnings 
derivative instruments that have not been designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we have entered into several derivative instruments  including hedges of anticipated electric and gas purchases  interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges which have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices  listed contracts  published quotations or quotations from counterparties 
in the absence thereof  we utilize mathematical models based on current and historical data 
the fair value of most of our derivatives is determined based upon quoted market prices 
therefore  the effect on earnings of valuations from our models is minimal

sfas foreign currency translation our financial statements are prepared using the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
in accordance with sfas foreign currency translation  foreign operations whose functional currency is deemed to be the local foreign currency  asset and liability accounts are translated into united states dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
translation gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are not included in determining net income but are reported in other comprehensive income 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
public service enterprise group incorporated the determination of an entity s functional currency requires management s judgment 
it is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are conducted  and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business 
as economic and business conditions change  we are required to reassess the economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency
