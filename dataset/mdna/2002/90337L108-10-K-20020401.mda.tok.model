item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company operates outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics which provide post operative care and treatment for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries 
at december   the company operated outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of the clinics in operation at december  was years 
since the inception of the company  clinics have been developed and six clinics have been acquired by the company 
to date  the company has sold one clinic  closed facilities due to negative clinic performance  consolidated the operations of three of its clinics with other existing clinics to more efficiently serve various geographic markets and closed two of the company s clinics after selling certain fixed assets at such facilities 
during  three clinics were closed with no loss being recognized related to these closures 
these three clinics combined accounted for net patient revenues and clinic operating costs for the year ended december  of  and  respectively 
two clinics were closed in with no loss being recognized 
these two clinics combined accounted for net patient revenues and clinic operating costs for the year ended december  of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  of  and  respectively 
during  six clinics were closed with no loss being recognized 
these six clinics combined accounted for net patient revenues and clinic operating costs for the year ended december  of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  of  and  respectively  and for the year ended december  of  and  respectively 
the company also sold one clinic during this clinic accounted for net patient revenues and clinic operating costs for the year ended december  of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  of  and  respectively  and for the year ended december  of  and  respectively 
in addition to the company s owned clinics  it also manages physical therapy facilities for third parties  including physicians  with six such third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on the results of operations and financial position of the company involving significant estimates requiring judgment by management 
the company s critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
the company bills primarily third party payors for services at standard rates 
actual payments received from the payors vary based upon the payor s fee schedules  contracts the company may have signed with the payor or limits on usual and customary charges 
based upon historical payment data  the company records a contractual allowance to reduce gross revenues to the estimated net realizable amount expected to be ultimately collected from payors 
the accuracy of revenue recognition improves with the timeliness of collections 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company reviews account agings and experience with particular payors at each clinic in determining an appropriate accrual for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have large numbers of older accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against the bad debt allowance 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its federal income tax liability and income taxes in the states in which it operates  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements  for tax and accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
management then must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net patient revenues net patient revenues increased to  for from  for  an increase of  or  on a increase in patient visits to  net patient revenues from the clinics opened during the new clinics accounted for of the increase  or  the remaining increase of  in net patient revenues is attributable to the clinics opened before the mature clinics 
of the  increase in net patient revenues from the mature clinics   was due to a increase in the number of patient visits to  while  was due to a increase in the average net revenue per visit to 
net patient revenues are based on established billing rates less allowances and discounts for patients covered by worker s compensation programs and other contractual programs 
payments received under these programs are based on predetermined rates and are generally less than the established billing rates of the clinics 
net patient revenues reflect reserves  which are evaluated quarterly by management  for contractual and other adjustments relating to patient discounts from certain payors 
reimbursement for outpatient therapy services provided to medicare beneficiaries is pursuant to a fee schedule published by the department of health and human services  and the total amount that may be paid by medicare in any one year for outpatient physical including speech language pathology or occupational therapy to any one patient is limited to  except for services provided in hospitals

historically  the company has generated cash from operations sufficient to fund its development activities and cover operational needs

sfas  business combinations 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting and requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s business because it had no planned or pending acquisitions that would have met the requirements for use of the pooling of interests method

goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which is effective for the company beginning in except for certain provisions that were effective july  sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized

this statement applies to all entities that have legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect sfas to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   the company had clinics in operation  of which opened in management s goal for is to open between and additional clinics 
the opening of these clinics is subject to the company s ability to identify suitable geographic locations and physical and occupational therapists to manage the clinics 
the company s operating results will be impacted by initial operating losses from the new clinics 
during the initial period of operation  operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics due to the start up costs of newly opened clinics including  without limitation  salaries and related costs of the physical and or occupational therapist and other clinic personnel  rent and equipment and other supplies required to open the clinic and the fact that patient visits and revenues tend to be lower in the first year of a new clinic s operation and increase significantly over the subsequent two to three years 
based on historical performance of the company s new clinics  the clinics opened in should favorably impact the company s results of operations for and beyond
