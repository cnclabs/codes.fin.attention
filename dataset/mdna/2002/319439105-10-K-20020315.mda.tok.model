purchases 
insurance agencies

accordingly  the results of operations of these companies have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the corporation since the date of the respective acquisition 
critical accounting policies the corporation s significant accounting policies are set forth in note one of the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies  because it requires management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the corporation s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers which is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the corporation also considers its policy regarding equity method investees to be a critical accounting policy due to the assumptions in the valuation of these investments and other subjective factors 
the corporation s equity method investments represent investments in venture capital limited partnerships which invest in early stage companies 
the corporation s recognition of earnings or losses from equity method investees is determined by the corporation s share of the investee s earnings on a quarterly basis 
the limited partnerships provide their quarterly financial information on a quarter lag basis  so the corporation s policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on these equity method investments on a quarter lag basis 
these limited partnerships record their investments in investee companies on a fair value basis  with changes in the underlying fair values being reflected as an adjustment to their earnings in the period such changes are determined 
the earnings of these limited partnerships  and therefore the amount recorded on an equity method basis by the corporation  are impacted significantly by changes in the underlying value of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest 
all of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest are privately held  and their market values are not readily available 
estimations of these values are made quarterly by the management of the limited partnerships  and are subject to review by the corporation for reasonableness 
the assumptions in the valuation of these investments by the limited partnerships include the viability of the business model  the ability of the company to obtain alternative financing  their ability to generate revenues in future periods and other subjective factors 
given the inherent risks associated with this type of investment in the current economic environment  there can be no guarantee that there will not be widely varying gains or losses on these equity method investments in future periods 
results of operations the corporation s results of operations and financial position are described in the following sections 
refer to table one and table five for annual and quarterly selected financial data  respectively 
versus the following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the corporation s results of operations for the years ended december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes on pages through net income amounted to million  or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   compared to million or diluted net income per share for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to restructuring charges and merger related expense of million pre tax million  or per diluted share after tax in  primarily associated with the carolina first merger  which occurred during the three months ended june  the increase in net income due to the restructuring charges and merger related expenses was offset in by i a million decrease in net interest income resulting from a compression of the net interest margin and decreasing loan demand during and ii increased expenses resulting primarily from an increase in occupancy and equipment expense resulting from the move into the new first charter center 
net income in and was also impacted certain other items  which are set fort in table two 
these other items are considered nonrecurring in nature by management and therefore should be considered in year over year analysis of results of operations 
net income for the fourth quarter was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in the fourth quarter the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a million increase in noninterest expense partially offset by a million increase in noninterest income 
the increase in noninterest expense was due to an increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with the move into the first charter center  expenses related to the implementation of a new computer operating system and increased professional service costs 
the increase in noninterest income was due to the active management of our securities portfolio  service charge income on deposit accounts  mortgage loan fees  trading gains  and the continued growth of first charter insurance services 
net income was also impacted by the other items described in table five

the changes in net interest income from year to year are analyzed in table four 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  a decrease of approximately percent from net interest income of million in the decrease was the result of the declining interest rate environment resulting from the slowing economy which has had a negative impact on the net interest margin as variable rate assets reprice faster than variable rate liabilities 
reduced loan demand  several large loan payoffs and our increased selectivity in seeking new opportunities in this economic environment have also had a negative impact on the net interest margin 
average interest earning assets increased approximately million to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period 
this increase is primarily due to a million increase in the corporation s average securities available for sale portfolio for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the increase in average securities available for sale was primarily due to net purchases of approximately million in securities available for sale during the year ended december  average interest earning assets also increased due to the purchase of four financial centers in november  as well as growth in the corporation s average loan portfolio  which increased million for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the securitization of million of mortgage loans during the first quarter of the decrease in average yield on interest earning assets to percent in  compared to percent in  resulted principally from the decrease in the average prime rate during to percent  from percent in the decrease in the average prime rate is attributable to the federal reserve s basis point decrease in the fed funds rate during the average yield earned on loans was percent in  compared to percent in in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million to billion during due to the use of federal home loan bank fhlb advances to fund securities purchases and increases in deposits 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to percent in  compared to percent in  primarily due to a decline in the average rate of borrowings 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was percent in  down from percent in similarly  the rate paid on other borrowed funds decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the decrease reflects the impact of the declining interest rate environment in  which had a negative impact on the net interest margin as assets repriced faster than liabilities 
the addition of lower yielding securities  higher levels of borrowings and competitive forces related to loan and deposit pricing also had a negative impact on the net interest margin 
see asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity for additional discussion on the corporation s management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following table includes for the years ended december   and interest income on interest earning assets and related average yields  as well as interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and related average rates paid

the amount of change that cannot be separated is allocated to each variance proportionately 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in amounted to million compared to the provision for loan losses of million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses was due to lower loan volume in and a significant increase in nonaccrual loans in  which did not recur in partially offsetting these factors in was the effect of higher net charge offs 
as adjusted to remove the effects of the february loan securitization and the sale of million in lower yielding loans in may  gross loans increased million during the year ended december  as compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  see allowance for loan losses for additional discussion of trends within the allowance for loan losses in current year and for a discussion of the corporation s management of credit risk related to the loan portfolio 
net charge offs for were million or percent of average loans compared to million or percent of average loans in the year to date increase in net loan charge offs was attributable to million of charge offs associated with two large commercial relationships which were written down during the fourth quarter of these charge offs are not considered to be necessarily indicative of an overall deterioration in the quality of the remaining portfolio 
without these two charge offs  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans would have been percent of average loans for versus percent for the provision for loan losses was less than the amount of net charge offs for because the commercial loans noted above had been identified as impaired during and specific reserves were allocated at that time 
noninterest income noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase was driven primarily by a percent increase in service charge income on deposit accounts for the year ended december  compared to the same period  which was due to the implementation of revenue enhancing projects as well as re pricing opportunities resulting from the acquisition of carolina first 
in addition  the declining rate environment has increased mortgage origination volume 
this has resulted in additional loan sales to the secondary market and correspondingly greater fee income 
active management of our securities portfolio resulted in the recognition of million in gains on security sales during  compared to losses of million during of the million loss in  million was attributed to a restructuring of the corporation s bond portfolio as a result of rising interest rates at the time of the sales 
continued growth of first charter insurance services  higher brokerage revenue and trading gains also increased noninterest income 
premiums earned on written covered call options on fixed income securities accounts for a majority of our trading gains 
at december   the corporation did not have any written covered call options outstanding 
it is generally the corporation s policy to structure these option contracts so that there are none outstanding at the end of a reporting period 
see note sixteen of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain related party transactions which impacted deposit service charges in the fourth quarter of noninterest income was also impacted in both periods by income and losses from equity method investees 
during the corporation recorded losses on equity method investees of million  compared to gains of million in the corporation s equity method investments represent investments in venture capital limited partnerships which invest in early stage companies 
the corporation s recognition of earnings or losses from equity method investees represents the corporation s share of the limited partnership s earnings on a quarterly basis 
these limited partnerships record their investments in investee companies on a fair value basis  with changes in the underlying fair values being reflected as an adjustment to their earnings in the period such changes are determined 
the earnings of these limited partnerships  and therefore the amount recorded on an equity method basis by the corporation  are impacted significantly by changes in the underlying value of the companies in which these partnerships invest 
all of the companies in which these limited partnerships invest are privately held  and their market values are not readily available 
estimations of these values are made quarterly by the management of the limited partnerships 
the assumptions in the valuation of these investments by the limited partnerships include the viability of the investee s business model  the ability of the company to obtain alternative financing  the company s ability to generate revenues in future periods  and other subjective factors 
the limited partnerships provide their quarterly financial information on a quarter lag basis  so the corporation has a policy of recording their share of these earnings or losses also on a quarter lag basis 
during the first quarter of  the corporation was notified by the management of one of the limited partnerships that they were in the process of revaluing one of their investments and that they expected that the value would decrease for the limited partnership s fourth quarter valuation 
as a result  the corporation expects to record losses on equity method investments in the first quarter of based on preliminary estimates by the management of the limited partnership  the corporation believes its share of the loss on this equity method investment could be between million and million 
these losses would represent elimination of a portion of previously recorded unrealized gains on this investee company  and would not represent a loss of the original principal invested in this company 
nevertheless  given the inherent risks associated with this type of investment in the current economic environment  there can be no guarantee that there will not be additional losses on these equity method investments in future periods 
noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable period 
the decrease was attributable to the restructuring charges and merger related expenses of million during the quarter ended june   primarily associated with the acquisition of carolina first 
this decrease was partially offset during by the additional operating costs associated with the four financial centers acquired during the fourth quarter of  an increase in occupancy and equipment expense as a result of the move into the new first charter center and investments in people and technology to position the corporation for growth 
income tax expense total income tax expense amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for the same comparable period 
the increase in the income tax expense was attributable to an increase in taxable income 
the increase in income tax expense  however  was not proportionate with the decrease in net income because portions of the merger and acquisition costs in were not deductible 
this created a decrease in the effective tax rate to percent in from percent in in the normal course of business  the corporation evaluates and implements tax planning strategies 
as a result of these strategies  management anticipates our effective tax rate to decrease to approximately percent to percent in table five selected quarterly financial data quarters dollars in thousands  except per share amounts fourth third second first income statement total interest income     total interest expense     net interest income     provision for loan losses    total noninterest income     total noninterest expense     net income loss before income taxes     income taxes     net income loss     per share data basic income loss diluted income loss cash dividends declared period end book value average shares outstanding basic     average shares outstanding diluted     ratios return on average shareholders equity return on average assets net interest margin average loans to average deposits average equity to average assets efficiency ratio selected period end balances securities available for sale     securities held to maturity loans  net     allowance for loan losses     total assets     total deposits     borrowings     total liabilities     total shareholders equity     selected average balances loans  net     earning assets     total assets     total deposits     borrowings     total shareholders equity     schedule of other items included in earnings noninterest income loss gain on sale of loans fixed income portfolio restructuring loss equity investment write down equity method loss income gain on sale of properties noninterest expense charitable trust merger and restructuring charges total other items other items  net of tax quarters dollars in thousands  except per share amounts fourth third second first income statement total interest income     total interest expense     net interest income     provision for loan losses     total noninterest income     total noninterest expense     net income loss before income taxes     income taxes    net income loss     per share data basic income loss diluted income loss cash dividends declared period end book value average shares outstanding basic     average shares outstanding diluted     ratios return on average shareholders equity return on average assets net interest margin average loans to average deposits average equity to average assets efficiency ratio selected period end balances securities available for sale     securities held to maturity  loans  net     allowance for loan losses     total assets     total deposits     borrowings     total liabilities     total shareholders equity     selected average balances loans  net     earning assets     total assets     total deposits     borrowings     total shareholders equity     schedule of other items included in earnings noninterest income loss gain on sale of loans fixed income portfolio restructuring loss   equity investment write down equity method loss income  gain on sale of properties  noninterest expense charitable trust  merger and restructuring charges  total other items   other items  net of tax  first charter corporation historical cash dividends declared

this decrease was primarily attributable to the differences in the items described below  which management considers as nonrecurring in nature and therefore should be considered in year over year analysis of operations 
net income for the year ended december  included the following items i million pre tax million after tax merger and restructuring charge primarily associated with the merger of carolina first  ii million pre tax earnings million after tax from equity method income on certain investments due to unrealized gains in underlying equity investments during the period  iii million pre tax million after tax gain on sale of property related to the sale of four duplicate branch facilities and one office building  iv million pre tax million after tax loss associated with the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio  v million pre tax million after tax loss associated with the write down of certain equity securities due to other than temporary impairment in value  vi million pre tax million after tax loss associated with the sale of mortgage loans  and vii million pre tax million after tax charitable trust contribution 
net income for the year ended december  includes the following items i million pre tax million after tax gain associated with the sale of mortgage loans  ii million pre tax earnings million after tax from equity method income on certain investments due to unrealized gains in underlying equity investments during the period  iii million pre tax million after tax gain associated with the sale of property  and iv  pre tax  after tax loss associated with the write down of certain equity securities due to other than temporary impairment in value 
refer to table two for detail of other items included in earnings 
net interest income for the year ended december   net interest income was million  an increase of percent from net interest income of million in the increase is attributable to an increase in average interest earning assets of million from billion during to billion during the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased to percent in from percent in the average yield on interest earning assets was percent in compared to percent in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was percent in  compared to percent in the average yield earned on loans was percent in  compared to percent in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was percent in  from percent in the increases in the average yields and average rates for compared to  resulted from the increase in the average prime rate during  from percent in to percent in provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in the increase in the provision was due to i loan growth  primarily in the commercial portfolio  ii increases in net charge offs due to the effect of higher interest rates and slower economic growth on some customers within the portfolio  and iii increases in nonperforming assets 
noninterest income noninterest income was million in compared to million in  for an increase of percent 
the increase was primarily due to increases in service charge income resulting from applying fcb s service charge rates to carolina first deposit accounts subsequent to the merger  as well as continued growth of first charter insurance services 
noninterest income was also impacted by the other items described in table two on page noninterest expense noninterest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to restructuring charges and merger related expenses of million  which occurred during as well as investments in people and technology to position first charter to better serve our existing and future clients 
noninterest expense was also impacted by the other items described in table two on page income tax expense total income tax expense for was million versus million in the decrease is attributable to a decrease in taxable income 
the decrease in tax expense  however  was not proportionate with the decrease in income because portions of the restructuring charges and merger related expense in were not deductible 
this created an increase in the effective tax rate from percent in to percent in financial condition summary total assets at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
gross loans at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
this decrease from prior periods was due to the securitization of million of mortgage loans in february these loans were securitized because of a change in interest rates and the resulting impact of that condition on the corporation s interest rate risk 
the securitized mortgage loans are now classified as mortgage backed securities in our available for sale portfolio 
total deposits increased million  or percent  to billion at december  and other borrowings increased million  or percent  to million at december  the increase in other borrowings was primarily due to increases in federal home loan bank advances principally used to fund security purchases 
investment portfolio securities available for sale are a component of the corporation s asset liability management strategy and may be sold in response to liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  and other factors 
they are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income 
all securities are classified as available for sale at december  as maturities  sales  or paydowns occur on securities  the proceeds are utilized to meet loan demand and to reinvest in additional securities 
at december   securities available for sale were billion or percent of total assets  compared to million  or percent of total assets  at december  the increase in securities available for sale was due to the securitization of million of mortgage loans in february  as well as the net purchase of million in securities available for sale made to raise the level of our interest earning assets 
the carrying value of these securities was approximately million above their amortized cost at december  and million above their amortized cost at december  the tax equivalent average yield on the securities available for sale portfolio was percent for and percent for the weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  and years at december  in conjunction with the merger  the corporation transferred million of carolina first s securities classified as held to maturity to available for sale due to the significance of the impact on the corporation s interest rate forecast as compared to corporate policy 
see note five of the consolidated financial statements for further details on securities 
the following table shows  as of december    and  the carrying value of i us government obligations  ii us government agency obligations  iii mortgage backed securities  iv state and municipal obligations  and v equity securities 
table six investment portfolio december  dollars in thousands securities available for sale us government obligations  us government agency obligations    mortgage backed securities    state  county  and municipal obligations    equity securities    total    securities held to maturity us government obligations  us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  state  county  and municipal obligations  total  loan portfolio gross loans totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this decrease from prior periods was due primarily to the securitization of million of mortgage loans in february as well as the effects of the slowing economy on dampened loan growth 
these mortgage loans were securitized because of a change in interest rates and the resulting impact of that condition on the corporation s interest rate risk 
the securitized mortgage loans are now classified as mortgage backed securities in our available for sale portfolio 
due to changes in certain interest rates during  and the resulting impact on the corporation s interest rate risk  the corporation sold million in lower yielding mortgage loans in the second quarter of the loan portfolio at december  was composed of percent commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  percent real estate construction loans  percent real estate mortgage loans  and percent installment loans 
this compares to a composition of percent commercial  financial and agricultural  percent real estate construction  percent real estate mortgage  and percent installment at december  approximately million of the real estate loans at december  are loans for which the principal source of repayment comes from the sale of real estate 
the remaining billion of loans collateralized by real estate at december  are i other commercial loans for which the primary source of repayment is derived from the ongoing cash flow of the business and which are also collateralized by real estate million  ii home equity loans which are collateralized by real estate million  iii individual residential mortgage loans million  and iv non real estate loans which are collateralized by real estate million 
the corporation s primary market area includes the state of north carolina  and predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte 
at december   the majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate loan portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within this region 
the diversity of the region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   preapproved but unused lines of credit totaled million  loan commitments totaled million and standby letters of credit aggregated million 
these amounts represent the bank s exposure to credit risk  and in the opinion of management  have no more than the normal lending risk that the bank commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the bank will obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
such obtained collateral varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects that these commitments can be funded through normal operations

total nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest at december  were million or percent of total loans and other real estate  compared to million or percent of total loans and other real estate at december  nonaccrual loans have decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the transfer of one large commercial relationship from nonaccrual status to other real estate as such loan was foreclosed on during the fourth quarter of as well as one commercial relationship which was repaid 
other real estate increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the large commercial relationship noted above 
the increase in nonaccrual loans in  and the decrease in loans days or more past due and still accruing interest in the same year  was attributable to the impact of higher interest rates and slower economic growth on some customers during that year 
interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans for the years ended december   and  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
interest income on all such loans included in the results of operations for  and amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest is based on a review of each loan 
generally  accrual of interest is discontinued on loans days past due as to principal or interest unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
based on such a review  management has determined it is probable that the principal as well as the accruing interest on these loans will be collected in full

since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions could continue to change and could result in future losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
management currently uses several measures to assess and control the loan portfolio risk 
for example  all loans over a certain dollar amount must receive an in depth review by an analyst in the bank s credit department 
any issues regarding risk assessments of those credits are addressed by the bank s senior risk managers and factored into management s decision to originate or renew the loan 
furthermore  large commitments are reviewed by both a board of directors loan committee and an executive loan committee comprised of executive management  the chief credit officer and senior lending officers of the bank 
the corporation also continues to employ an independent third party risk assessment group to review the underwriting  documentation and risk grading analysis 
this third party group reviews loans on a sampling basis at regular intervals throughout the year 
the third party s evaluation and report is shared with executive management and the loan and audit committees of the bank 
management uses the information developed from the procedures described above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio 
this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses 
as part of the continual grading process  individual commercial loans are assigned a credit risk grade based on their credit quality  which is subject to change as conditions warrant 
any changes in those risk assessments as determined by the outside risk assessment group  regulatory examiners or the corporation s risk management division are also considered in the allowance for loan losses analysis 
management considers certain commercial loans on nonaccrual status to be individually impaired and measures such impairment and the related allowance for loan loss based primarily upon collateral values 
an estimate of an allowance is made for all other graded loans in the portfolio based on their assigned credit risk grade  type of loan  historical loss experience and other matters related to credit risk 
in the allowance for loan loss analysis process  the bank also aggregates non graded loans into pools of similar credits and reviews the historical loss experience associated with these pools as additional criteria to allocate the allowance to each category 
the bank also considers the impact of the area  local  regional and national economies in making estimates of the allowance for loan losses 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or percent of gross loans compared to million or percent at december  and million  or percent at december  during the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans increased due to the february mortgage loan securitization  which removed  of allowance for loan losses when the loans were securitized and reclassified from loans into securities available for sale 
securitized loans consisted of residential mortgage loans  which generally have a lower percentage of allocated allowance for loan losses 
this increase in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans was offset by higher net loan charge offs associated with two large commercial relationships which were written down during the fourth quarter of these commercial loans had been identified as impaired during and had specific allocated reserves 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories  the percentage of the allowance amount in each category to the total allowance and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans as of december     and table eleven allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      installment      total      the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions 
deposits table three provides information on the average amounts of deposits and the rates paid by deposit category 
total deposits at december  were billion  an percent increase from december  insured money market accounts increased million or percent  demand deposits increased million or percent  and certificates of deposit increased million or percent  while savings deposits decreased million or percent 
increases in money market and certificates of deposit were due to marketing campaigns directed toward packaging and promoting these accounts more effectively  as well as the purchase of million of brokered certificates of deposits used as a funding source 
the reduction in savings deposits was due to the corporation reducing the interest rates paid on these accounts which encouraged migration to other deposit account types 
see note ten of the consolidated financial statements for further details on deposits 
other borrowings other borrowings increased million during the year  to million at december   from million at december  the components of this increase consisted primarily of an increase of million in fhlb advances and an increase of million in short term borrowings consisting primarily of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these borrowings were principally used to fund securities purchases 
the following is a schedule of other borrowings which consists of the following categories securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb borrowings for the years ended december   and table twelve other borrowings dollars in thousands federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb and other borrowings balance as of december    average balance    maximum outstanding at any month end    interest rate as of december average interest rate at december   fcb had one available line of credit with the fhlb totaling million with approximately million outstanding 
the outstanding amounts consisted of million maturing in  million maturing in  million maturing in  million in  million maturing in  million maturing in and million maturing in in addition  the fhlb requires banks to pledge collateral to secure the advances as described in the line of credit agreement 
the collateral consists of fhlb stock and qualifying family residential mortgage loans 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows adequate to fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract deposits  flexible repricing schedules in a sizable portion of the loan portfolio  current earnings  a strong capital base and the ability to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
management s asset liability policy is to maximize net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
the corporation s primary source of funding is from customer deposits  loan repayments  and securities available for sale 
if additional funding sources are needed  the bank has access to federal fund lines at correspondent banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  as described above  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling million with million available 
at december   fcb also had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million  of which there were no amounts outstanding 
at december   the corporation had lines of credit with suntrust bank totaling million with million outstanding and commercial paper outstandings of million 
the corporation s other borrowings capacity is limited to percent of earning assets 
at december   earning assets totaled billion  which translated to a borrowing capacity of approximately million 
another source of liquidity is the securities available for sale portfolio 
see financial condition investment portfolio for a further discussion 
management believes the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs and deposit withdrawal requirements 
the corporation has obligations under existing contractual obligations that will require payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about such payments to be made in future periods

asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management strategy is to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by interest rate changes without unduly penalizing current earnings 
one method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure  over various time periods  the interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  however  this method addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value 
management uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of earnings at risk due to changes in interest rates 
this model is updated monthly and is based on a range of interest rate scenarios 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for interest rate risk is percent of net interest income when considering an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
management believes this method more accurately measures interest rate risk 
assuming a basis point pro rata increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would positively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  assuming a basis point pro rata decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would negatively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  both scenarios are within management s acceptable range 
in an effort to increase earning assets during  the corporation added million in securities available for sale to minimize the effects on net interest income of the basis point decrease in interest rates and dampened loan demand due to the slowing economic environment 
this action increased the securities available for sale balance to billion at december  from million at december  from time to time  the corporation may use derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
at december   the corporation had no such derivative financial instruments 
refer to notes one and six to consolidated financial statements and results of operations for a discussion of the corporation s use of written over the counter covered call options during the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the corporation is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised

at december  total rate sensitive liabilities due within one year were billion compared to rate sensitive assets of billion  for a negative one year cumulative gap of approximately million 
as a result  increases in interest rates in future periods may have the impact of reducing net interest income 
as part of the corporation s asset liability management strategy  the corporation has preliminarily decided to restructure the securities available for sale portfolio by selling a portion of the securities portfolio with longer term maturities and replacing such securities with securities having shorter term maturities 
if the corporation takes the actions described above during the first quarter of  it is expected that the corporation would realize a gain in the range of million to million

thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the bank to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the bank is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for payments of dividends 
see note eighteen of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the federal reserve board the frb standards  the corporation must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier i capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less certain intangible assets and excluding unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in frb regulations 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the occ 
see note nineteen of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of requirements

on april   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the corporation s common stock 
through december   the corporation had repurchased all shares of its common stock authorized in open market transactions at an average per share price of approximately  subject to adjustment as discussed below  which reduced shareholders equity by million 
on december   the corporation entered into a share repurchase agreement with a third party for the final  shares repurchased according to this authorization 
the transaction will be settled with the counterparty during the second quarter of based on the average of the corporation s stock price during the term of the agreement 
the corporation has structured the agreement so as to account for the repurchase as equity in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf fluctuations in the value of the corporation s common stock will not be recognized in the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the earnings per share calculation assumes that this transaction will settle in shares  so the diluted earnings per share calculations during the period the agreement is outstanding are impacted in that the potential common shares that could be issued will be included in diluted average shares outstanding 
on january   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of the corporation s common stock
