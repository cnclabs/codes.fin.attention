for competitive access providers  we design building entrance laterals  fiber rings and conduit systems 
we obtain rights of way and permits in support of engineering activities  and provide construction management and inspection personnel in conjunction with engineering services or on a stand alone basis 
also  for cable television multiple system operators  we perform make ready studies  strand mapping  field walk out  computer aided radio frequency design and drafting  and fiber cable routing and design 

table of contents construction  installation  and maintenance 
we place and splice cable  excavate trenches in which to place the cable  place related structures such as poles  anchors  conduits  manholes  cabinets and closures  place drop lines from the main distribution lines to the customer s home or business  and monitor and remove these facilities 
in addition  we install and maintain transmission and central office equipment 
we have the capability to directionally bore the placement of cables  a highly specialized and increasingly necessary method of placing buried cable networks in congested urban and suburban markets where trenching is impractical 
premise wiring 
we provide premise wiring services to a variety of large corporations and certain governmental agencies 
these services  unlike the engineering  construction and maintenance services provided to telecommunication companies  are predominantly limited to the installation  repair and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure within improved structures 
projects include the placement and removal of various types of cable within buildings and individual offices 
these services generally include the development of communication networks within a company or government agency and relate primarily to the establishment and maintenance of computer operations  telephone systems  internet access and communications monitoring systems established for purposes of monitoring environmental controls or security procedures 
underground utility locating services under a variety of state laws  excavators are required to request the location of underground utilities such as telephone  cable television  power and gas prior to excavating 
utilities must respond to these requests from excavators to mark their underground and buried facilities 
we provide these underground utility locating services 
electrical construction and maintenance services we perform electrical construction and maintenance services for electric companies 
this construction is performed primarily as a stand alone service  although at times it is performed in conjunction with other services we provide to telecommunications providers 
these services include installing and maintaining electrical transmission and distribution lines  setting utility poles and stringing electrical lines  principally above ground 
the work performed may involve high voltage splicing and  on occasion  the installation of underground high voltage distribution systems 
we also repair and replace lines that are damaged or destroyed as a result of weather conditions 
revenues by type of customer for the  and fiscal years  the percentages of our total contract revenues derived from specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating  and electrical construction and maintenance were as set forth below year ended july  july  july  telecommunications utility line locating electrical utilities total customer relationships our current customers include local exchange carriers such as bellsouth  qwest  sprint  sbc communications  inc  alltel corporation  and verizon 
we also currently provide telecommunications engineering  construction and maintenance services to a number of cable television multiple system operators or direct satellite operators including adelphia  at t broadband  comcast  directv  charter  cablevision  insight communications  mediacom  cox communications  inc  and time warner 
premise wiring services have 
table of contents been provided to  among others  lucent technologies  inc  international business machines corporation  and various state and local governments 
our customer base is highly concentrated with our top five customers in fiscal years   and accounting for approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were derived from bellsouth  from comcast  and from adelphia 
we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenues and operating income will continue to be derived from a concentrated group of customers 
a significant amount of our business is performed under master service agreements 
these agreements are generally exclusive requirement contracts  with certain exceptions  including the customer s option to perform the services with its own employees 
the agreements are typically three to five years in duration  although the terms generally permit the customer to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
each agreement contemplates hundreds of individual construction and maintenance projects valued generally at less than  each 
other jobs are bid by us on a nonrecurring basis 
although historically master service agreements have been awarded through a competitive bidding process  recent trends have been toward securing or extending such contracts on negotiated terms 
our sales and marketing efforts are the responsibility of our management and that of our operating subsidiaries 
on may   we announced that we had been notified by a major cable customer  adelphia  to suspend work on substantially all of adelphia s projects 
subsequently  on june   adelphia announced that it  together with its subsidiaries  had filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
at july   we had outstanding pre petition receivables from adelphia of million 
we have filed liens on various properties to secure substantially all of the receivables and have undertaken an analysis of the value of the receivables 
based on our analysis  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million for these receivables 
this allowance reflects management s best estimate of amounts owed to us by adelphia based on our understanding of the current status of the adelphia bankruptcy proceeding and a number of assumptions  including assumptions about the validity  priority and enforceability of our security interests and the value of other similarly secured assets 
should any of the factors underlying our estimate change  the amount of the allowance could change significantly 
on july  another customer  worldcom  inc worldcom and its subsidiaries  filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
at july   we had outstanding pre petition receivables from worldcom of million 
management determined that the likelihood of payment is low and  accordingly  we fully reserved this receivable 
should any additional customers file for bankruptcy or experience financial difficulties  or if recovery efforts relating to the adelphia receivables fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of the allowances currently provided 
in addition  material changes in our customers revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
backlog our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts 
our backlog at july  and july  was million and billion  respectively 
the decline was primarily due to the general slowdown in the telecommunications industry and specific reductions associated with our business with adelphia  directv and worldcom  partially offset by an increase in backlog from at t broadband 
we expect to complete approximately of this backlog during fiscal year in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract 
however  the customer is obligated to obtain these services from us if they are not performed by the customer s employees 
additionally  we are committed to perform these services if requested by the customer 
many of these contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the term of the contract based on our historical 
table of contents relationships with customers and our experience in procurements of this nature 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
safety and risk management we are committed to ensuring that our employees perform their work in the safest possible manner 
we regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits 
our safety director  a holding company employee  reviews all accidents and claims throughout our operating subsidiaries  examines trends and implements changes in procedures or communications to address any safety issues 
claims arising in our business are generally workers compensation  various general liabilities  and vehicle liabilities including personal injury and property damage 
for losses occurring during fiscal years and  we retain the risk on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability to  for general liability to  and for worker s compensation  in states where we are allowed to retain risk  to  for fiscal year  we had aggregate stop loss coverage for the above exposures at the stated retentions of approximately million and million for fiscal year in addition  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit for each year of million 
within the umbrella coverage  we have retained the risk of loss between and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million for each of fiscal year and we carefully monitor claims and participate actively in claims estimates and adjustments 
the estimated costs of self insured claims  which include estimates for incurred but not reported claims  are accrued as liabilities 
due to fluctuations in our loss experience in recent years  insurance accruals have varied from year to year and have had an effect on operating margins 
additionally  if we were to experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the telecommunications engineering  construction and maintenance services industry  electrical contracting industry  and utility locating industry in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete with other independent contractors in the markets in which we operate  including several that are large domestic companies that may have financial  technical  and marketing resources that exceed our own 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from master service agreements and price is often an important factor in the award of such agreements 
accordingly  we could be outbid by our competitors in an effort to procure such business 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we may also face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers  particularly telecommunications providers that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us 
although a significant portion of these services is currently outsourced  there can be no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource telecommunications engineering  construction and maintenance services in the future 
we believe that the principal competitive factors resulting in our market reputation for telecommunications engineering  construction and maintenance services  electrical contracting services  and utility locating services include technical expertise  price  quality of service  availability of skilled technical personnel  worker and general public safety  geographic presence  breadth of service offerings  adherence to industry standards  and financial stability 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 

table of contents employees as of july   we employed approximately  persons 
the number of our employees varies according to the work in progress 
we maintain a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel from which to draw to supervise all projects 
additional employees are added as needed to complete specific projects 
materials generally  our customers supply most or all of the materials required for a particular contract and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment to perform the installation services 
however  with respect to a portion of our contracts  we may supply part or all of the materials required 
in these instances  we are not dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete the job 
we are not presently experiencing  nor do we anticipate experiencing  any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials 
item properties we lease our executive offices located in palm beach gardens  florida 
our subsidiaries operate from owned or leased administrative offices  district field offices  equipment yards  shop facilities  and temporary storage locations

we also lease and own other smaller properties as necessary to enable us to effectively perform our obligations under master service agreements and other specific contracts 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 
item legal proceedings the federal employment tax returns for one of our subsidiaries were audited by the internal revenue service irs 
as a result of the audit  we received an examination report from the irs in october proposing a million tax deficiency 
at issue  according to the examination report  was the taxpayer s payment of certain employee allowances for the years through without reporting such payment as wages on its employees w forms 
in april  we reached a settlement agreement with the irs 
this settlement  which was paid in full to the irs on may   resulted in a decrease to our payroll tax reserve of approximately million 
this reduced our cost of earned revenues for fiscal on september   as amended on november  and june   williams communications llc williams filed suit against one of our subsidiaries  niels fugal sons company nfs  in the united states district court of the northern district of oklahoma for claims that include breach of contract with respect to fiber optic cable installation projects that nfs had constructed for williams 
williams seeks an unspecified amount of damages  including compensatory  liquidated and punitive damages 
we have answered and asserted affirmative defenses to their complaints and have filed a counterclaim for unpaid amounts of approximately million due under the contract which is primarily recorded in retainage as of july  trial is currently set for march management believes we have meritorious defenses against these claims and intends to defend them vigorously 
management believes that this litigation will not materially affect our financial position or future operating results  although we cannot give you any assurance about the ultimate outcome of this or any other litigation 
in the normal course of business  certain of our subsidiaries have pending claims and legal proceedings 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that none of the current claims or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services  including engineering  construction  installation and maintenance services to telecommunications providers throughout the united states 
we also provide underground locating services to various utilities and maintenance and construction services to electrical utilities 
for the fiscal year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating and construction and maintenance to electrical utilities contributed approximately  and  respectively  to our total contract revenues 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of arguss for approximately million shares of our common stock 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million before various transaction costs 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including million of goodwill 
subsequent to our acquisition of arguss  we paid off all of its bank debt of approximately million 
the results of operations of arguss are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we provide a significant portion of our services pursuant to multi year master service agreements 
under master service agreements  we generally agree to provide for a period of one or more years  generally on an exclusive basis  a customer s specified service requirements within a given geographical area 
master service agreements generally provide that we will furnish a specified unit of service for a specified unit price eg  fiber optic cable will be installed underground for a specified rate of dollars per foot 
a customer may generally terminate these agreements for convenience with at least days prior written notice 
master service agreements are usually awarded on a competitive bid basis but in some cases are extended by negotiation rather than re bid 
we are currently a party to approximately master service agreements 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for particular jobs 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts are generally from three to four months in duration  depending upon the size of the project 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld subject to project completion and acceptance by the customer 
contract revenues from multi year master service agreements represented and of total contract revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and contract revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  represented and of total contract revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue on unit based contracts as the unit is completed 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method based primarily on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications companies 
beginning in the latter part of and continuing throughout fiscal  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that has resulted in a number of our customers experiencing financial difficulties 
several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection  including adelphia and worldcom 
at july   we had pre petition outstanding receivables from adelphia and worldcom of approximately million and million  respectively 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry has adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties 
capital expenditures by telecommunications customers during the remainder of calendar are expected to remain at low levels in comparison with prior years  and there can be no assurance that additional customers will not file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise experience severe financial difficulties in fiscal additional bankrupt 
table of contents cies of companies in the telecommunications sector or further decreases in our customer s capital expenditures could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
for fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of our contract revenues were from bellsouth  and  respectively  of our contract revenues were from comcast  and  respectively  of our contract revenues were from adelphia  and  respectively  of the contract revenues were from at t broadband  and  respectively  of our contract revenues were from directv 
on may   we announced that we were notified by several subsidiaries of adelphia to suspend work on substantially all of their projects 
in august  in accordance with our contractual rights  we notified directv of our intention to cease performing services for them effective march  cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts 
cost of earned revenues includes all costs of construction personnel  subcontractor costs  all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation and insurance and materials not supplied by the customer 
generally the customer provides the materials that are to be used for its job 
because we retain the risk for automobile and general liability  worker s compensation  and employee group health claims subject to certain limits  a change in experience or actuarial assumptions that did not affect the rate of claims payments could nonetheless materially affect results of operations in a particular period 
general and administrative costs include all our costs at the holding company level  as well as subsidiary management personnel and administrative overhead 
our management personnel  including subsidiary management  perform substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material selling expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  self insured claims liability  income taxes  intangible assets  investments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on current information  historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recognition of revenue that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with our audit committee 
for a further discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts are unit based 
revenue on unit based contracts is recognized as the unit is completed 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method based primarily on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings primarily relates to revenues for completed but unbilled units under unit based contracts  as well as unbilled revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method for non unit based contracts 
for those contracts in which billings exceed contract 
table of contents revenues recognized to date  such excesses are included in the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable has been impaired at the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
estimates of uncollectable amounts are reviewed each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and considers changes in customer payment terms and other factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as an accrued liability 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
in addition  we retain the risk  up to certain limits  under a self insured employee health plan 
we periodically review the paid claims history of our employee health plan and analyze our accrued liability for claims  including claims incurred but not yet paid  reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued under the employee health plan include  but are not limited to  frequency of use  changes in medical costs  unfavorable jury decisions  legislative changes  changes in the medical conditions of claimants  court interpretations and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for automobile  general liability workers compensation and employee group health claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what we use to calculate the accrued liability  we would have to record expenses in excess of what we have already accrued 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with that statement  we conduct on at least an annual basis a review of our reporting units to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of our goodwill may be impaired and written down 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
when necessary  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
impairment losses are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for its income tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
where 
table of contents there is a range of loss  we record the minimum estimated liability related to those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined

contract revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this decrease  million was attributable to a decline in demand for specialty contracting services provided to telecommunications companies and million was attributable to a decline in demand for construction and maintenance services provided to electrical utilities  offset by an increase of million in underground utility location services 
the decrease in our telecommunications service revenues is attributable to lower revenues  primarily from telecommunication and cable customers  due in part to the continued decrease in capital spending by our customers  bankruptcies of certain customers  and the overall downturn in the economy 
acquisitions made subsequent to july  contributed million of contract revenues during fiscal excluding revenues attributable to these acquisitions  contract revenues would have decreased million  or  during fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of contract revenues  or of our total contract revenues  from telecommunications services as compared to million or for fiscal the decrease in our telecommunications service revenue is primarily due to lower demand from several cable customers  and emerging telecommunications providers and several incumbent local exchange carriers 

table of contents acquisitions subsequent to july  contributed million  or  of contract revenues from telecommunications services during fiscal we recognized contract revenues of million  or of our total contract revenues  from underground utility locating services in fiscal as compared to million  or in fiscal additional contract awards in fiscal increased our revenues from these services

subsequently  on june   adelphia announced that it  together with its subsidiaries  had filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
at july   we had outstanding pre petition receivables from adelphia of million 
we have filed liens on various properties to secure substantially all of the receivables and have undertaken an analysis of the value of the receivables 
based on our analysis  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million for these receivables 
adelphia accounted for of our revenues for the year ended july  on july  another customer  worldcom and its subsidiaries  filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
at july   we had outstanding pre petition receivables from worldcom of million 
management determined that the likelihood of payment is low and  accordingly  we fully reserved this receivable 
worldcom accounted for of our revenues for the year ended july  should any additional customers file for bankruptcy or experience financial difficulties  or if our efforts to recover outstanding adelphia and other receivables fail  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided 
in addition  material changes in our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
cost of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to from 
direct labor and subcontractor costs declined by and  respectively  as a percentage of contract revenues 
this decrease was more than offset as a percentage of contract revenues by an increase in other direct costs and insurance of 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to decreases in group insurance  bonuses  and payroll taxes of million  partially offset by increases in franchise taxes and other general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of contract revenues to from in fiscal as compared to fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to million of bad debt expense recorded on receivables due from adelphia and worldcom 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to 
table of contents from 
the million decrease was a result of the elimination of amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  offset in part by an increase in depreciation expense of million  primarily resulting from our acquisition of arguss 
amortization expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average outstanding cash balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal as compared to million in the same period last year 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non deductible impairment losses recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 non deductible impairment losses recorded in connection with the annual review of our reporting units and an event related review of certain reporting units under sfas no 
 state income taxes and other non deductible expense for tax purposes 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for sfas no 
and impairment write off 
the adoption of sfas no
