item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
general during the past five fiscal years  a number of events occurred which have had a significant impact on our financial condition 
in january  an investment group advised by three cities research  inc tcr  purchased a controlling equity interest in us by acquiring all of the common and series a preferred stock held by our former chairman  vice chairman and chief executive officer and purchasing from us shares of newly authorized series b preferred stock 
subsequent to the close of fiscal  we sold additional shares of the series b preferred stock to these investors  our directors and management 
in connection with the change in control  three former directors resigned from the board of directors and three managing directors of tcr were appointed to serve on the board of directors 
in march  we appointed michael m 
searles as the new president and chief executive officer of our operating subsidiaries 
mr 
searles was elected a member of the board of directors in march and chairman of the board in november in july  our two operating subsidiaries  general textiles and factory u  inc  were merged to form general textiles  inc 
in november  we merged general textiles  inc into ourselves  converted our previous three classes of stock into a single class of common stock and changed our corporate name from family bargain corporation to factory u stores  inc at that time  we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
we undertook a rights offering and issued to our stockholders transferable rights to purchase an additional  shares of common stock for per share 
the tcr investors purchased approximately  shares 
during fiscal and  our operational focus was on improving the operating performance of existing stores and opening new stores 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  closed stores and renovated stores 
in fiscal  we opened stores  closed stores and renovated stores 
of all the stores we opened in fiscal and  were located in three states in which we had not previously operated 
during fiscal  we faced a difficult economic environment with a slowing economy  the impact of terrorist attacks on september  and a highly promotional environment within the retail industry 
we believe that our core customers have been disproportionately disadvantaged in the current economy 
fiscal has been a very difficult year for us and apparel retailers in general 
as part of our ongoing store evaluation process  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our real estate portfolio and store operating performance and decided to close under performing stores ie  stores do not meet our then current minimum operational performance criteria established by management 
unlike existing markets  we have learned that in new markets  and particularly in a difficult economic environment  we initially require a larger population of our core demographic consumer to achieve our financial objectives 
in conjunction with the store closures  we realigned our field organization and streamlined our workforce 
as a result of these restructuring initiatives  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million including lease termination costs of million  inventory liquidation costs of million  fixed asset write downs of million  employee termination costs of million and other costs of million 
as of april   we have closed of these under performing stores 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  we must make estimates in the following areas o inventory valuation merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market determined using the retail inventory method rim on a first in  first out basis 
under the rim  the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a computed cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates regarding markdowns and shrinkage  which may from time to time cause adjustments to the gross margin in the subsequent period 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of merchandise items that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover  and applying rim to transactions over a period of time that includes different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise items 
to minimize the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory from occurring  we utilize sub departments in which fairly homogeneous classes of merchandise items having similar gross margin are grouped 
in addition  failure to take markdown currently may result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
o valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets we use certain assumptions in establishing the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount that the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related depreciation or amortization expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used in operations 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  significant changes in an asset s ability to generate positive cash flows  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset 
o accrued restructuring costs we have estimated an amount for the charge and the related liability regarding our restructuring initiatives including store closures  realignment of our field organization and workforce reductions in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
materially different reported results would be likely if the timing and extent of the adopted restructuring plan were changed 
o litigation reserves based in part on the advice of our legal counsel  estimated amounts for litigation and claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
we anticipate these reserves will be remeasured as new facts come to light in any particular case 
o worker s compensation accrual at the beginning of fiscal  we transitioned to a partially self insured worker s compensation program 
this new program has both specific and aggregate stop loss amounts 
the maximum specific stop loss is  per occurrence and the deductible aggregate stop loss is million for the policy year ended january  we utilize internal actuarial methods  as well as an independent third party actuary for the purpose of estimating ultimate costs for a particular policy year 
based on these actuarial methods along with current available information and insurance industry statistics  the ultimate expected losses for the policy year ended january  were estimated to be approximately million 
our estimate is based on average claims experience in our industry and our own experience in terms of frequency and severity of claims  with no explicit provision for adverse fluctuation from year to year and is subject to inherent variability 
this variability may lead to ultimate payments being either greater or less than the amounts presented above 
o valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established  if deemed necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment we currently receive 
results of operations we define our fiscal year by the calendar year in which most of our business activity occurs the fiscal year ended february  is referred to as fiscal 
the following table sets forth operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses pre opening expenses amortization of intangibles restructuring charge condemnation award stock based compensation expense operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal as of february   we operated stores compared to stores as february  in fiscal  we opened net stores and closed stores 
fiscal was a week fiscal year as compared to a week fiscal year for fiscal net sales were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
excluding the extra week of sales rd week in fiscal  net sales for fiscal increased 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal versus an increase of in fiscal the increase in net sales was related to new store growth offset by negative comparable store sales 
the average number of stores in operation was for fiscal compared to for fiscal  an increase of 
comparable store sales decreased primarily as a result of reduced customer traffic 
fiscal has been a very difficult year for our business and apparel retailers in general 
we believe our core customers have been affected by the slow economy and in california  our largest market  increased utilities and fuel costs 
compounding this  apparel is obviously a deferrable purchase for our core customers who have limited discretionary income 
apparel and houseware purchases may be reduced and deferred in favor of more current needs such as food  housing  utilities and transportation 
in addition  we experienced the most promotional and competitive holiday period in recent memory 
the highly promotional environment was evidenced by the post thanksgiving offerings by many big box discounters  which enticed consumers in with close to cost or below cost items in the electronics and hard goods categories 
gross profit was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the current fiscal year s gross profit reflected a non cash charge of million related to the anticipated inventory liquidation cost for the closing of the under performing stores as previously mentioned 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to higher markdown volume  partially offset by improved initial markup and favorable distribution costs 
the higher markdown volume was related to a very heavy promotional environment during the holiday season and earlier clearance of merchandise than a year ago 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in selling and administrative spending as a percentage of net sales was both spending related and sales volume related 
the unfavorable spending variance was primarily due to higher store labor  store occupancy and advertising expenses 
the increase in store labor was primarily due to minimum wage increases for both hourly and salaried associates  higher health care and workers compensation costs 
the increase in store occupancy was due to higher rent and depreciation expense for new stores 
the increase in advertising was due to increased promotional activity based on competition in the marketplace 
pre opening expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in pre opening expenses was related to new store openings this year versus new store openings last year  as well as million recorded in fiscal associated with the opening of our distribution center in lewisville  texas  which became fully operational in february amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in amortization of  represented the cessation of amortization associated with certain costs incurred in the ownership change of the company in fiscal the restructuring charge of million was part of the total million charge related to our restructuring initiatives  as previously discussed 
we recorded million of the pre tax million charge as a non cash inventory liquidation cost which was included in the cost of sales 
we recorded a non recurring gain of million during fiscal related to a condemnation award from the city of san diego for a store located in downtown san diego  california 
we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense related to certain performance based stock options during fiscal in the amount of  compared to million for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we removed the market price hurdle of for  stock options held by a former executive vice president who retired in august as a result of the removal of the market price hurdle  we incurred a non cash charge of  in fiscal  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense in the amounts of million in july and million in august when stock options with market price hurdles of and  respectively  became exercisable 
interest expense  net was  in fiscal versus million in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates under our revolving credit facility and interest income received from the internal revenue service related to prior years tax refund due 
we recorded a federal and state income tax benefit of million in fiscal and a federal and state income tax provision of million in fiscal the income tax benefit was due to the loss we incurred in fiscal the income tax provision recorded in fiscal included a favorable adjustment of million to our income tax provision for a reduction in our tax valuation allowance and recognition of additional net operating loss carryforwards 
fiscal compared to fiscal as of february   we operated stores compared to as of january  in fiscal  we opened new stores and closed stores 
net sales were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
comparable store sales increased in fiscal versus an increase of in fiscal the increase in net sales was related to new store growth  an increase in comparable store sales and a rd week of sales in fiscal comparable store sales increased as a result of increased customer traffic and average purchase 
gross profit was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was related to sales growth 
the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to higher outbound freight costs and higher distribution center processing costs due to the transfer of in store marking to our distribution centers 
previously  in store marking costs were included in selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling and administrative spending increased due to increased sales volume  new store growth  increased labor rates due to minimum wage increases and higher utility costs in certain operating areas 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to increased sales volume and lower corporate incentive bonus charges 
pre opening expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in pre opening expenses was related to new store openings this year versus new store openings last year  as well as million in fiscal associated with the opening of our new distribution center in lewisville  texas 
the new distribution center became fully operational in february amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in amortization of  was due to the cessation of amortization associated with certain costs incurred in the ownership change of the company in fiscal we recorded a non recurring gain of million during fiscal related to a condemnation award from the city of san diego for a store located in downtown san diego  california 
we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense related to certain performance based stock options during fiscal in the amount of million compared to million for fiscal in fiscal  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense in the amounts of million in july and million in august when stock options with market price hurdles of and  respectively  became exercisable 
in fiscal  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million when stock options with a market price hurdle of became exercisable in october interest expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
federal and state income taxes were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
income taxes increased as a result of higher taxable income versus the same period a year ago  offset by a favorable adjustment of million to our income tax provision during fiscal for a reduction in our tax valuation allowance and recognition of additional net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources general we finance our operations through credit provided by vendors and other suppliers  amounts available under our million revolving credit facility and internally generated cash flow 
credit terms provided by vendors and other suppliers are usually net days 
amounts which may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility are based on a percentage of eligible inventories and receivables  as defined  outstanding from time to time 
at february   we were in compliance with all financial and tangible net worth covenants  as defined  and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at february   based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable  we were eligible to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
we believe that our sources of cash  including the revolving credit facility  will be adequate to finance our operations  capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows in fiscal  net cash generated from operating activities was million versus million generated in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to timing of vendor payments and lower average store inventories 
in fiscal and  cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively  related primarily to capital expenditures for both new and existing stores 
the new store growth in fiscal was significantly lower than fiscal we opened new stores in fiscal compared to stores in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we invested significant capital expenditures in the development of our texas distribution center  which became fully operational in february in fiscal  we used million for our financing activities  including a payment of million for our junior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan 
in fiscal  our financing activities provided a net cash flow of million  including million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan   in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and  in payments of stock subscription notes receivable  partially offset by million in repayments of our junior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations and payments of deferred debt issuance costs of revolving credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
under this revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to of our eligible inventory and of our eligible accounts receivable  as defined  up to million 
the credit facility was amended on april  to increase our million sub facility for letters of credit to million 
as of february   interest on the credit facility was at the prime rate  or at our election  libor plus 
under the terms of the credit facility  the interest rate may increase or decrease subject to earnings before interest  tax obligations  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda  as defined  on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis 
accordingly  prime rate borrowings could range from prime to prime plus and libor borrowings from libor plus to libor plus 
the credit facility expires on march   subject to automatic one year renewal periods  unless terminated earlier by either party 
we are obligated to pay fees equal to per annum on the unused amount of the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on accounts receivable and inventory and requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth in the event that our borrowing availability is less than million 
at february   based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable  we were eligible to borrow million under the credit facility and had no outstanding borrowings  and we had a million standby letter of credit outstanding 
junior subordinated notes the junior subordinated notes are non interest bearing and are reflected on our balance sheets at the present value using a discount rate of 
as of february   the junior subordinated notes had a face value of million and a related unamortized discount of million  resulting in a net carrying value of million 
the discount is amortized to interest expense as a non cash charge until the notes are paid in full 
we made a principal payment on the junior subordinated notes of million in december additional principal payments are scheduled on december  million  on december  and december  million and a final payment on may  million 
we believe that our sources of cash  including the revolving credit facility  should be adequate to finance our debt obligation as it becomes due for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  which includes costs to open new stores  to renovate and relocate existing stores  to upgrade information systems and to develop our new san diego distribution center 
this new distribution center would be approximately  square feet and service our west coast  arizona  nevada and part of new mexico markets 
we anticipate that it will become operational in our second quarter of fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for this facility  most of which will occur in fiscal we believe the capital expenditures for this facility and other capital expenditures will be financed from internal cash flow 
store closures and restructuring initiatives as previously discussed  in fiscal we anticipate closing approximately under performing stores as part of our restructuring plan and six other stores which are either due to non renewable leases or relocation opportunities 
the majority of the store closures are part of our restructuring initiatives intended to improve future financial performance 
the cash charges to close a store principally consist of lease termination or sublease costs  employee severance and tear down costs 
in addition to the closing of under performing stores  we also included the realignment of field organization and workforce reductions as part of our restructuring initiatives 
currently  we estimate the cash requirement in fiscal for the restructuring would be approximately million 
we believe that our sources of cash  including the revolving credit facility  should be adequate to fund our restructuring efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  as well as estimated cash requirement related to the restructuring initiatives  as of february  these should be in read in conjunction with note restructuring charge  note long term debt and revolving credit facility and note lease commitments in the accompanied financial statements 
in thousands junior subordinated operating capital restructuring notes leases leases charge total fiscal year thereafter   total     risk factors terrorism and the uncertainty of war may affect our business terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september   the response by the united states initiated on october  and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock will trade  the markets in which we operate and our operations and profitability 
the potential near term and long term effects of any future terrorist attacks may have for our customers  the market for our common stock  the markets for our products and the united states economy are uncertain 
the consequence of any terrorist attack  or any armed conflicts which may result  are unpredictable  and we are unable to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets or our business 
our future growth depends on new store openings our growth in operating results depends largely on our ability to open and operate new stores profitably 
in fiscal  and  we opened  and stores  respectively 
as of april   we have opened two new stores and currently expect to open to additional new stores in fiscal our business strategy depends on many factors  including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for our new stores  negotiate leases with acceptable terms  refurbish stores  appropriately upgrade our financial and management information systems and controls and manage our operating expenses 
in addition  we must be able to continue to hire  train  motivate and retain competent managers and store personnel 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve our future expansion goals 
any failure by us to achieve our expansion goals on a timely basis  obtain acceptance in markets in which we currently have limited or no presence  attract and retain management and other qualified personnel  appropriately upgrade our financial and management information systems and control or manage operating expenses could adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also cannot assure that our new store growth will improve our results of operations 
a variety of factors are critical to the success of our new stores and such factors include but not limited to store sales  store location  store size  lease terms  initial advertising effectiveness and brand recognition 
assuming that our planned expansion occurs as anticipated  our store base will include a relatively high proportion of stores with relatively short operating histories 
we cannot assure that our new stores will achieve the sales per selling square foot and store contributions currently achieved at our existing store base 
if our new stores on average fail to achieve our minimum operational performance criteria  our planned expansion could produce a decrease in our overall sales per selling square foot and store contributions 
increases in advertising and pre opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores could also contribute to a decrease in our operating margins 
our store concentration in california poses localized risks in california  where we currently operate stores  which represents almost half of our total store base 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition largely depend upon trends in the california economy 
operating costs  such as minimum wage  health care  workers compensation  utilities and fuel  in california have been significantly higher than other regions in the country where we currently operate 
if operating costs continue to increase in california  it could pose a negative impact to our overall store contribution and operating margins 
in addition  california historically has been vulnerable to certain natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods and civil disturbance 
at times  these events have disrupted the local economy 
these events could also pose physical risks to our properties 
in california  we employ  both in our stores and in our corporate headquarters  a substantial number of employees who earn wages near or at the minimum wage 
actions by both the federal and california state government have increased and may continue to increase the minimum wages that we must pay to such employees 
historically  we have mitigated such increases through policies to manage our ratio of wages to sales 
however  we can make no assurances that these measures and other steps taken will be adequate to control the impact of any hourly wage increases in the future and may have a negative impact on profitability in the future 
utility costs for electricity and natural gas in california have risen significantly 
these costs may continue to increase due to the actions of federal and state governments and agencies  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we have attempted to mitigate such increases through energy conservation measures and other cost cutting steps 
however  we can make no assurances that these measures and other steps taken will be adequate to control the impact of these utility cost increases in the future  nor can we make assurances as to what impact these utility cost increases may have on our sales related to our core customer base in california 
disruptions in receiving and distribution could impact our business our success depends upon whether our receiving and shipping schedules are well organized and managed 
as we continue to grow  we may face unexpected demands on our distribution operations that could cause delays in delivery of merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores 
a fire  earthquake or other disaster at our distribution centers could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly because much of our merchandise consists of closeouts 
we maintain commercial property and business interruption  earthquake and flood insurance 
relationships with our vendors and the availability of close out and excess in season merchandise affect our business our success depends in large part on our ability to locate and purchase quality close out and excess in season merchandise at attractive prices 
we cannot be certain that such merchandise will continue to be available in the future 
further  we may not be able to find and purchase merchandise in quantities necessary to accommodate our growth 
although we believe our relationships with our vendors are good  we do not have long term agreements with any vendor 
as a result  we must continuously seek out buying opportunities from our existing suppliers and from new sources 
we compete for these opportunities with other wholesalers and retailers  discount and deep discount chains  mass merchandisers and various privately held companies and individuals 
although we do not depend on any single vendor or group of vendors and believe we can successfully compete in seeking out new vendors  a disruption in the availability of merchandise at attractive prices could impair our business 
our business is subject to seaonality we have historically realized our highest levels of sales and income during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the quarters ending in october and january as a result of the back to school august and september and holiday november and december seasons 
any adverse events during the third and fourth quarter could therefore affect our financial performance 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our net sales and net income during these two quarters 
in anticipation of the back to school and holiday seasons  we may purchase substantial amounts of seasonal merchandise 
if for any reason our net sales during these seasons were to fall below seasonal norms and or our expectations  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to clear excess inventory 
our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by higher than expected markdowns 
we face intense competition we operate in a highly competitive marketplace 
we compete with large discount retail chains  such as wal mart  k mart  target and mervyn s  and with off price chains  such as tj maxx  ross stores  marshall s and big lots  some of which have substantially greater resources than ours 
we also compete with independent and small chain retailers and flea markets also known as swap meets which serve the same low and low middle income market 
in the future  new companies may also enter the deep discount retail industry 
although we believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of the principal competitive factors in our markets  which are price  quality and site location  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
in fiscal  we experienced one of the toughest promotional environments in recent history 
we compete in the discount retail merchandise business  which is a highly competitive environment that subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from lower net sales and reduced margins 
we expect the competition will continue and increase in the future 
we have started new merchandise strategies  including new category offerings  better execution of our core businesses and broader methods of marketing our business  all designed to improve customer frequency and attract new customers 
however  we can make no assurances that these strategies and other actions taken will be adequate to minimize our exposure to any negative impacts due to competition 
our business is vulnerable to economic factors beyond our control and changes in the minimum wage our ability to provide quality merchandise at everyday low prices could be hindered by certain economic factors beyond our control  including but not limited to o increases in inflation  o increases in operating costs  o increases in employee health care and workers compensation costs  o increases in prevailing wage levels  and o decreases in consumer confidence levels 
in january  california enacted a minimum wage increase of per hour with an additional increase required in january we believe that annual payroll expenses could increase approximately  over this two year period as a result 
our business is subject to many environmental regulations under various federal and local environmental laws and regulations  current or previous occupants of property may become liable for the costs of removing any hazardous substances found on the property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we lease all of our stores 
although we have not been notified of  and are not aware of  any current environmental liability  claim or non compliance  we could incur costs in the future related to our leased properties 
in the ordinary course of our business  we sometimes handle or dispose of commonplace household products that are classified as hazardous materials under various environmental laws and regulations 
we have adopted policies regarding the handling and disposal of these products  and we train our employees on how to handle and dispose of them 
we cannot assure that our policies and training will successfully help us avoid potential violations of these environmental laws and regulations in the future 
effects of anti takeover provisions and control by our existing major shareholders in addition to some governing provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  we are also subject to certain delaware laws and regulations which could delay  discourage and prevent others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change in control  even if such actions would benefit our shareholders and us 
moreover  we have a single shareholder that currently owns more than of our voting stock 
as a result  they may have certain ability to influence all matters requiring the vote of our shareholders  including the election of board of directors and most or our corporate actions 
they may also control our policies and potentially prevent a change in control 
this could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has had substantial fluctuation the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our recapitalization occurred in november trading prices for our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to many factors  including o the depth of the market for our common stock  o changes in expectations of our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  o variations in our operating results  o conditions or trends in our industry  o additions or departures of key personnel  and o future sales of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued two new pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt obligations
