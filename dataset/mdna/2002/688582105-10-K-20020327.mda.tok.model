item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december    and results of operations overview we provide services and products primarily focused in the repair and healing of the musculoskeletal system 
based on our knowledge of the allograft bone tissue industry  we believe that we are the world s largest processor and developer of human bone and bone connective tissue 
historically  we have provided services and technology associated with making human tissue safe for transplantation 
we also develop and process new forms of tissue for use in a variety of surgical procedures 
while we perform the medical education to teach surgeons about the uses of these tissue forms  the tissue forms are generally distributed to hospitals by our tissue bank clients 
see below for a discussion of an additional method we are utilizing to generate tissue processing revenues 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were generated from these tissue service activities 
commencing in the first half of  and expanding in the second half  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to hospitals 
we expect to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts to hospitals in and beyond 
as a result  we expect that revenues from direct distribution of tissue will continue to grow over the next several years 
in turn  beginning in late  this should have a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating income because although we will incur recovery costs in connection with tissue we distribute directly  we will not share a portion of the invoice price on these tissue forms with our tissue bank clients as we do with the tissue that we process for them  but they distribute 
for the year ended december   of our consolidated revenues were generated from processing tissue that our tissue bank clients distributed 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted our liquidity and cash flow 
we have had to make additional investments in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  and expect to make additional investments in inventory and deferred processing costs  as necessary  to support our efforts to expand direct distribution 
in addition  our days sales in accounts receivable have increased from days in to days in  primarily as a result of the change in our customer mix resulting from our direct distribution efforts 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which typically pay invoices slower than our historical tissue bank customer base  we expect that our days sales in accounts receivable will remain at levels or increase slightly 
for the year ended december   we experienced a substantial decrease in available cash and cash equivalents due to our continued investments in our business 
we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in however  we intend to seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan and to re build cash reserves 
there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continual basis  we evaluate our estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available to us 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  deferred processing costs  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts primarily for our direct distribution accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o we record reductions to revenue for estimated product and allograft tissue forms returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than our historical experience  a reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
o we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable products and allograft tissue forms equal to the difference between cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
o we depreciate amortize our property  plant and equipment based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
in addition  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the company determines that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
o we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of tax attributes 
while we have considered current tax laws in establishing our tax liabilities  in the event we were to settle our tax liabilities for less than amounts accrued we would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine it would cost us more to settle our tax liabilities  an adjustment would be charged to income thus reducing income in that period 
net income loss we incurred a consolidated net loss in of  or 
diluted loss per share compared to net income of  or 
diluted income per share in and  or 
diluted income per share in the net loss in includes  before income tax benefit i a provision of  primarily related to provisions for excess inventory and instrument sets for spinal implant systems  ii a provision of  for equipment which will no longer be utilized in the processing of allograft tissue  and iii a provision of  primarily for severance costs associated with the departure of an executive officer

consolidated loss before income taxes was  in compared to income before taxes of  in and  in income before income taxes in and included  and  respectively  related to the patent litigation settlement with depuy 
the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december    and net revenues consolidated net revenues increased in to  compared to consolidated revenues of  in the increase in was principally due to higher revenues in bio implants and product lines included in other revenues mainly as a result of increased volume  partially offset by a decrease in grafton r dbm revenues as a result of reduced unit sales volume and a decrease in base tissue processing revenues as a result of processing fewer donors in compared to domestic net revenues increased slightly in to  from  in foreign based revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in foreign based revenues was primarily as a result of increased unit sales volume in all product lines 
consolidated net revenues in were  as compared to  in domestic net revenues  were  in as compared to  in revenues from bio implants increased in due to increased unit sales volume offsetting a decline in base allograft tissue processing revenues  which resulted from a decline in the number of donors processed  and a decline in domestic grafton r dbm revenues as a result of lower unit volume 
foreign net revenues were  in compared to  in revenues associated with the european introduction of grafton r dbm and an increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenue offset decreased revenues from bovine tissue sales and ceramic and titanium coating services 
grafton r demineralized bone matrix dbm segment  or grafton r dbm segment  revenues were  in  a decrease of from revenues of  in foreign based grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from  in  principally due to an increase in unit sales volume 
domestic grafton r dbm segment revenues decreased  or to  in domestic grafton r dbm segment revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in unit sales volume as a result of increased competition 
in  grafton r dbm faced  and we expect it will continue to face  increasing competition as more companies develop and market products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
base tissue segment revenues increased to  in from  in the increase is principally the result of a increase in bio implant revenues and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenues  partially offset by a decrease in base tissue processing revenues resulting from a decline in donors processed for our clients 
the increase in bio implant revenues is principally due to increased unit volume and the ability to charge higher unit sale prices as a result of our direct distribution of some of those units to hospitals 
revenue from other product lines increased in to  from  in the increase principally resulted from improved volume in spinal metal implant systems  coatings  ceramic products and bovine products 
metal spinal implant systems accounted for and coating revenues accounted for of the overall increase in other revenues 
grafton r dbm segment net revenues in were  as compared to  in grafton r dbm segment revenues were positively effected by the introduction of grafton r dbm in europe  which offset a decrease in domestic revenues 
in  grafton r dbm revenues were adversely impacted by increased competition 
base tissue segment net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase was principally due to a increase in bio implant processing revenues and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in base allograft tissue processing revenues as a result of a decline in the number of donors processed  due in part to the decline in base tissue needs of surgeons as they shift to using more highly advanced tissues such as our line of graftech tm bio implants 
during   and  two of our clients  mtf and arc  in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments together accounted for   and of consolidated net revenues 
we have processing agreements with each of these clients which expire in august  and december   respectively 
the agreement which expires in august  may be terminated by either us or mtf upon six months prior written notice  which has not been given by either party as of the date of this report 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  in  and in the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in compared to principally resulted from i our direct distribution efforts which reduced gross profit margin by two percentage points in as a result of incurring additional costs equivalent to the incremental revenue we are recognizing from these efforts  ii the underabsorption of fixed costs due to increased capacity as a result of our new processing facility and a decline in the number of donors processed  costs associated with implementation of new processing technologies  and bio implant and metal spinal implant product lines that have not yet achieved revenue levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs  iii a decline in base tissue processing revenue as a result of a decline in the number of donors processed  iv charges for excess metal spinal implant inventory of  and v a  charge for equipment which will no longer be utilized in our processing of allograft tissue 
we expect that as our direct distribution efforts continue to expand and we incur the incremental costs and expenses  including depreciation  related to our new allograft tissue processing facility  gross profit margin will decline slightly in from the level achieved in beginning in late  our direct distribution efforts should have a positive impact on our gross profit margins because although we will incur recovery costs in connection with tissue we distribute directly  we will not share a portion of the invoice price with our tissue bank clients as we do with tissue that we process for them which they distribute 
in addition  we have implemented programs to improve gross profit margin through cost cutting initiatives  efficiency gains and reductions in the cost of materials 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that any of these programs will be successful 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in resulted primarily from the underabsorption of costs related to increased capacity  new processing technologies  a decline in the number of donors processed  and allograft bone tissue forms that had not yet achieved revenue levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs while they are in launch mode 
marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to  from  in in  marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses were higher than expenses of  the increase in relates mainly to i activities to secure additional sources of donated allograft tissue resulting in expenditures of  which included provisions related to our funding of the american tissue services foundation  ii increased legal fees in connection with various lawsuits to which we are a party  including the gensci patent litigation lawsuit  see part i  item  legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  iii increased costs related to marketing  selling and promotional activities associated with grafton r dbm and the new bio implant tissue forms  iv a provision of  for excess instrument sets associated with spinal implant systems  and v a  provision for severance costs related primarily to the departure of an executive officer 
in and  we expended  and  respectively  for the prosecution of our patents and resulting trial in the gensci patent litigation 
the increase in over is primarily due to increases in legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  and increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  especially with respect to new bio implant tissue forms 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property 
as a result we are currently involved in three patent lawsuits 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is expensive and has had  and will likely have  a negative impact on our future operating results  although we anticipate expenditures for these activities to be significantly less than in the previous year 
however  we believe it is necessary to defend our technology and related intellectual property in which we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts of money to develop 
research and development expenses consolidated research and development expenses decreased in to  from  in research and development expenses in were higher than research and development expenses of  the decrease in was primarily related to the completion of development of bio implant tissue forms which were launched in and the completion of new processing technology and packaging  which were implemented in the increase in was primarily attributable to increased spending in the grafton r dbm and the base tissue segments associated with the continued development of several new processing technologies  development of new allograft bone tissue forms  specifically bio implant tissue forms  and ongoing support for existing products and services 
income from litigation settlement in november   we settled all claims which we had filed against depuy in the patent infringement lawsuit against gensci labs and gensci sciences 
as part of the settlement  depuy agreed to stop selling the gensci products accused of infringing our patents no later than february  and to pay us  we received payments and recognized income of  in each quarter of and a payment of  in the fourth quarter of operating income loss we incurred a consolidated operating loss in of  compared to consolidated operating income of  in grafton r dbm segment operating income decreased in to  from  in the decrease results principally from i increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  ii increased legal fees  iii reduced revenue levels  and iv a decrease in patent litigation settlement payments of  we incurred an operating loss in the base tissue segment of  in compared to operating income of  in the operating loss principally resulted from lower i gross margins due to our direct distribution activities  ii a decline in donor processing revenue  iii the underabsorption of processing costs  iv increased legal fees  v provisions for excess instrument sets and equipment which will no longer be utilized in our production process  and vi increased costs for marketing  selling and promotional activities primarily associated with bio implants 
operating losses associated with other revenues were  and  in and  respectively 
the operating loss in increased over the operating loss in principally as a result of provisions for excess inventory and instrumentation for metal spinal implant systems and reserves for our funding of the american tissue services foundation 
consolidated operating income decreased in to  from  in primarily as a result of declines in operating income in the grafton r dbm segment and base tissue segments 
grafton r dbm segment operating income decreased in to  from  in primarily due to i lower gross margins due to underabsorption of costs  ii increased legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  iii increased costs associated with marketing  iv selling and promotional activities  v and a decrease of  in patent litigation settlement payments 
base tissue segment operating income decreased in to  from  in principally as a result of i lower gross margins due to underabsorption of costs  ii increased legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  and iii increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  especially with respect to new bio implant tissue forms 
operating income associated with other revenues declined in to a loss of  from a loss of  in other income expense in  other income decreased  to  from  in the decrease was principally due to lower interest income as a result of a decline in interest rates and lower average cash balances available for investment and interest expense on our long term debt 
prior to  the majority of our interest costs were capitalized in connection with the construction of our new allograft tissue processing facility 
in late  we began to charge such interest costs to earnings since the facility was substantially complete 
in  interest expense will continue to increase as we recognize a full year of interest expense on our long term debt and due to increases in our interest rates 
see discussion of the amendment to our credit facility in liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  other income increased  to  income tax provision in  we provided a benefit for income taxes on our domestic losses due to our ability to carryback and carryforward these losses 
no income tax benefit has been recorded for foreign losses  principally as a result of the uncertainty of realization of such future tax benefits 
our effective income tax rate in was and in the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the non recognition for tax purposes of foreign operating losses and the impact of domestic state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital decreased  to  at december  compared to  at december  the decrease resulted primarily from utilization of cash and short term investments to fund capital expenditures  including construction of the new allograft tissue processing facility  other production equipment and instruments for spinal implant systems 
net cash used in operating activities was  in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  in the decrease resulted primarily from the net loss incurred in compared to net income in  investments in accounts receivable  inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  partially offset by increased non cash charges  principally depreciation and amortization 
beginning in  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to surgeons and hospitals 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted our liquidity and cash flow 
we have had to make additional investments in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct sales efforts  and expect to make additional investments in inventory and deferred processing costs  as necessary  to support our efforts to expand direct distribution 
in addition  our days sales in accounts receivable have increased from days in to days in  primarily as a result of the change in our customer mix resulting from our direct distribution efforts 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which typically pay billings slower than our historical tissue bank customer base  we expect that our days sales in accounts receivable will remain at levels or increase slightly 
cash used in investing activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures to  in from  in  due to reduced spending on the construction of our new allograft tissue processing facility  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of land of  in the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new allograft tissue processing facility in eatontown  new jersey 
see item properties and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
through december   we incurred  of capital expenditures  including capitalized interest of  related to the new allograft tissue processing facility  of which  has been funded through bank financing 
net cash provided by financing activities in decreased to  from  in in  we borrowed the remaining funds of  available under the equipment line of credit  while in we borrowed  under our equipment line of credit 
in september   our equipment line of credit converted to an equipment term loan pursuant to the provisions of the credit agreement 
we have a credit facility with a us bank that includes a  revolving line of credit  a building mortgage loan and an equipment term loan 
at december   there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit   was outstanding under the building mortgage loan and  was outstanding under the equipment term loan 
in march   the credit facility was amended  and among other things  the  revolving line of credit  which was originally due to expire may   was extended to april  in addition  the amendment to the credit facility establishes a variable interest rate on all parts of the credit facility that changes the interest rate to range from prime minus 
to prime plus  or from the london interbank offered rate libor plus to libor plus  based upon a leverage ratio as defined 
under the terms of the amendment  the new interest rate  which initially is retroactive to january  and is effective through november   is prime plus or libor plus  whichever we choose 
thereafter  the interest rate will be in the range described above 
in certain circumstances  as defined in the amendment  the interest rate on the credit facility may increase up to an additional 
the credit facility  as detailed in the amendment  is collateralized by domestic accounts receivable  domestic inventory  the new allograft tissue processing facility  including all equipment and improvements therein and a pledge of of our ownership in our foreign subsidiaries 
the amendment imposes on us certain restrictive operating and financial covenants 
the amendment established additional covenants including a restriction on our paying cash dividends  a restriction on our incurring or maintaining additional indebtedness  a restriction on our selling of assets or engaging in mergers or acquisitions and limitations on our ability to make cash advances to our foreign operations or investments 
the amendment also resets the interest coverage ratio  which we did not comply with for the year ended december   but the bank permanently waived such non compliance 
the amendment also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  of our business  which impairs the interests of the bank 
the bank has the right to approve  in advance  the form and substance of any equity capital transaction  except for a common stock transaction resulting in the issuance of less than of our total issued and outstanding capital stock as of the date of such transaction 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
following a default  the bank may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the equipment loan and or the mortgage  and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
at december   certain of our foreign based subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating   with no expiration date   expiring through 
we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards in the consolidated financial statements because realization of the future tax benefits is uncertain 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february   we entered into a distribution agreement to market a pedicle screw system and a cervical plating system 
this agreement requires us to make minimum purchase commitments of  over the two year period beginning on february  in  we purchased  of inventory in advance of the beginning of the two year commitment 
we expect to purchase the remaining balance of  in and in february   we entered into a loan agreement with the american tissue services foundation  or atsf  a not for profit tissue recovery organization  which expires in december  pursuant to the loan agreement  atsf has borrowed  from us as of december  to fund its operations 
in february   we amended the loan agreement to allow atsf to borrow up to an aggregate of  based upon our discussions with management of atsf  we expect that atsf will borrow approximately  in we have entered into a fifteen year processing and distribution agreement with atsf effective december  michael j 
jeffries  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  is one of the three members of atsf s board of directors 
atsf is a not for profit corporation  and neither mr 
jeffries nor us owns any equity or any other interest in atsf 
mr 
jeffries receives no compensation from atsf 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than after in thousands total one year years years long term debt     non cancelable operating lease obligations    atsf loan commitment purchase commitment    assumes atsf borrows  in and will not require the remaining portion of the commitment 
assumes the purchase commitment is satisfied ratably over the two year commitment period 
for the year ended december   we experienced a substantial decrease in available cash and cash equivalents due to our continued investments in our business 
we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o additional investments in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  o the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  o the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products  and o the defense and outcome of pending litigation  including any outcomes which are adverse to us  to the extent not covered by product liability or other insurance 
in this regard  we have two patent lawsuits that are scheduled for trial in and in which any damages that may be awarded against us are not covered by insurance 
we intend to seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan and to re build cash reserves 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
recent accounting developments in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of sfas no 
 all acquisitions completed after june  are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we had no such transactions in sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting of goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets no longer be amortized but rather be tested for impairment annually 
intangible assets with a finite life shall continue to be amortized over the estimated useful life 
sfas no 
is effective for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that the elimination of amortization is to be applied on a prospective basis and prior periods are not to be restated 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step is to be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year and must be completed within six months of adoption 
the second step  which must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year  measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of a liability associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  or development and or normal operations of a long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of these pronouncements to determine the effect they may have on the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 beginning in we will no longer amortize goodwill 
amortization of goodwill in was  impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings involving product liability and patent infringement claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters see  part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
risk factors we may need to secure additional financing to fund our long term strategic plan and to re build cash reserves 
for the year ended december   we experienced a substantial decrease in available cash and cash equivalents due to our continued investments in our business 
we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o additional investments in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  o the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  o the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products  and o the defense and outcome of pending litigation  including any outcomes which are adverse to us  to the extent not covered by product liability or other insurance 
in this regard we have two patent lawsuits that are scheduled for trial in and in which any damages that may be awarded against us are not covered by insurance 
we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity and or debt financing in private placements or public offerings to provide funds to meet the need of our long term strategic plan and to re build cash reserves 
as noted in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we intend to seek such funding 
additional funds may not be available  or if available  may not be available on favorable terms 
further equity financings  if obtained  may substantially dilute the interest of our pre existing shareholders 
any additional debt financings may contain restrictive terms that limit our operating flexibility 
as a result  any future financings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with covenants under our loan and security agreement could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have recently amended our loan and security agreement and mortgage relating to our headquarters and manufacturing facility in eatontown  new jersey  among other things  to obtain a waiver of a breach of a financial covenant for the year ended december   to provide revised financial covenants  to grant additional security and to extend our revolving line of credit for an additional two year period through april  this loan facility provides a revolving credit facility  an equipment loan and a mortgage 
it also imposes on us certain restrictive operating and financial covenants 
the loan facility includes a covenant that provides for a 
increase in the interest rate payable under the loan facility if we fail to raise at least million of additional equity capital by june   which rate is subject to reduction to the initial rates only after we have subsequently raised such additional capital 
the loan covenants significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to advance or incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  pay dividends  sell assets  engage in mergers or acquisitions  or make investments 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
the loan facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in our condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  which impairs the interests of the bank 
following a default  the lender may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the equipment loan and or the mortgage  and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
foreclosure would adversely affect our continued operations and our ability to repay the indebtedness under the loan facility 
without the availability of the financing under the revolving line of credit  we may not be able to meet our liquidity requirements during and would be required to curtail our operations or raise additional funds  which may not be available 
we also may not have the funds to repay the debt upon acceleration 
even if available  the terms of any additional debt or equity financing that we may incur could restrict our operational flexibility and thereby adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our cash flows are expected to be adversely impacted by our focus on direct distribution 
commencing in the first half of  and expanding in the second half of  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to surgeons and hospitals 
we expect to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts to surgeons and hospitals in and beyond 
as a result  we expect that revenues from direct distribution of tissue will grow significantly as a percentage of our consolidated revenues over the next several years 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted and is expected to continue to have an impact on our cash flow 
our days sales in accounts receivable have increased from days in to days in  primarily as a result of the change in our customer mix resulting from our direct distribution efforts 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which typically pay invoices slower than our historical customer base  we expect that our days sales in accounts receivable will remain at levels or increase slightly 
we are dependent upon two primary clients who provide the bulk of our revenues 
we are the processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf and arc each accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we entered into a year exclusive processing agreement with arc in december  and a five year non exclusive processing agreement with mtf in september  however  the mtf contract may be canceled at any time upon either party giving six months prior written notice 
we are currently in litigation against mtf 
see item legal proceedings 
the loss of either mtf or arc as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for either entity would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion 
our allograft bone tissue processing business primarily depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients and tro who recover donated human cadaveric tissue for us 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons to donate  or may not be willing to provide  sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
to date  our inability to obtain sufficient amounts of donated tissue to fulfill the demand for our bio implants has limited the growth of revenues we receive from these tissue forms 
although we have taken steps to address this tissue supply problem  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or that we will otherwise be able to secure a sufficient supply of tissue 
our inability to secure enough donor tissue to meet our demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competitive threats from firms with greater financial resources and lower costs 
the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers and allograft bone tissue processed by others  primarily tissue banks 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still maintains approximately a share of the united states bone graft market 
in europe  bone graft substitutes  such as bovine bone tissue and synthetics  currently comprise most of the bone grafting market 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others and bone graft substitutes 
in recent years  our grafton r dbm products have faced increasing competitive pressures as more companies have developed  or have announced they are developing  products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
certain of those competitors have  in turn  partnered with large orthopaedic and spine companies to market the competing products they have developed 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
many of these competitors have research and development  marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours 
they also offer a full line of metal implants and other products used in spinal surgeries 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us since they can offer surgeons a more complete line of products than we currently can 
the intense competition in the grafton r dbm segment has caused our revenues in this segment to stop growing and to decline slightly in we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
many of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
several for profit companies  certain of which have substantially greater resources then we do  are processing  marketing and distributing allograft tissue 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing and distribution 
we are currently involved in patent litigation which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we may become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we are currently involved in litigation involving our patents and patents held by certain of our competitors 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is very expensive and these expenses have had  and are likely to have  an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
in addition  the industry in which we compete is known for having a great deal of litigation involving patents 
these factors could cause us to become involved in additional patent litigations in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose those litigations in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose those litigations in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as noted in item legal proceedings  two patent lawsuits pending against us are scheduled for trial in given the current limitations on our liquidity discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditions liquidity and capital resources  we may be unable to pay any significant damages should a judgment be entered against us in these lawsuits or other lawsuits in which we are a party or we may be unable to obtain a bond necessary to appeal any such judgment 
also  a judgement entered against us in any of these lawsuits could cause us to violate one or more of the covenants of our loan agreement 
during the course of the patent litigations in which we are involved  interim information about the status of each of these litigations may be released 
although these interim releases may differ from the final determinations in these litigations  such information may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems 
the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges for the processing of allograft bone tissue  depends upon our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from their clients  which are typically hospitals 
the ability of hospitals to pay fees to our clients  or directly to us for allograft bone tissue or non allograft spinal implant systems distributed directly by us to the hospitals  depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
the medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products 
we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to be based primarily upon the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  neurological and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand for our allograft tissue forms 
governmental regulation could restrict the use of our products 
in the united states  the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue are subject to federal regulation pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas and receive payments for all such services  with the exception of removal and implantation 
we pay tros and certain of our clients in connection with their procuring tissue on our behalf 
if nota is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents us from receiving payment for services we render or which prevents us from paying tros or certain of our clients for the services they render for us  our business could be materially  adversely affected 
we are engaged through our direct sales employees and our independent sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and in particular our allograft tissue forms  and we intend to continue our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue products  payments in connections with such education efforts are not exempt from nota s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with our education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
in various countries outside the united states  national laws and regulations restrict or control the availability and or use of tissues 
there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws  regulations or interpretations will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations in those countries 
in the united states  the allograft bone tissues that we process are regulated by the fda as human tissue based products under section of the public health service act  and under certain circumstances  may be regulated as a medical device under the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
fda regulations do not require that human tissue based products be cleared or approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register and list these products with fda and to comply with regulations concerning tissue donor screening and testing  and related procedures and record keeping 
fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
fda has proposed  but not yet finalized  good tissue practice regulations that would impose requirements on the manufacture of human tissue based products  including tissue recovery  donor screening  donor testing  processing  storage  labeling  packaging  and distribution 
the human tissue based product category is a relatively new one in fda regulations  and it is possible that fda will change its approach to human tissue based products in general or to particular categories of products to require fda clearance or approval or otherwise restrict distribution 
the metal spinal implant products that we distribute in the united states are regulated by the fda as medical devices 
medical devices generally require fda approval or clearance before they may be marketed 
there are two processes by which medical devices can receive approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance under the k process  in which the manufacturer or processor demonstrates that its product is substantially equivalent to another lawfully marketed product ie  that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a lawfully marketed product and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as the lawfully marketed product 
k submissions usually include safety and performance data  and in some cases  the submission must include clinical data 
marketing may commence if and when fda issues a letter finding substantial equivalence 
if a medical device does not qualify for the k process  the product may not be distributed until a premarket approval application has been approved by fda 
premarket approval applications must demonstrate product safety and effectiveness 
a premarket approval application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of preclinical and clinical studies 
the manufacturer must also pass a premarket inspection of its compliance with fda s quality systems regulation 
marketing may commence if and when fda issues a premarket approval 
the ovation tm system  the vbr tm system  the sentinal tm pedicle screw system and affirm tm cervical plate system are being marketed pursuant to k clearances 
fda has changed the regulatory status of our grafton r dbm products and the consequences of that decision are uncertain 
in march   fda informed us that it is changing the regulatory status of grafton r dbm and will henceforth regulate it as a medical device as well 
medical device regulation is a more stringent category of regulation and  in particular  medical devices require fda clearance or approval 
we believe fda s change in its position regarding grafton r dbm results from its decision to regulate all demineralized bone with a carrier  including those processed and marketed by some of our competitors  as medical devices 
we intend to persuade fda that its initial designation of grafton r dbm as a human tissue based product was and still is correct 
if we are unsuccessful in that effort  we will be required to obtain a medical device approval or clearance  and to comply with medical device postmarketing obligations 
we believe that grafton r dbm will be eligible for k clearance  but we cannot be sure that we will not be required to obtain premarket approval  or that fda will issue any clearance or approval in a timely fashion  or at all 
in its march letter regarding grafton r dbm  fda stated that it intends to allow us a reasonable period of time to obtain clearance for grafton r dbm  and we will continue to process and distribute grafton r dbm during this period 
we cannot be sure that fda will clear or approve our submission or will clear or approve all claims that we currently make for grafton r dbm 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval or limitation on grafton r dbm claims could adversely affect us 
we also market grafton plus tm dbm as a human tissue based product 
fda s determination regarding grafton r dbm is also likely to be applied to grafton plus tm dbm 
if fda maintains its position that all demineralized bone with a carrier is a medical device  we would also be required to obtain fda clearance or approval for grafton plus tm dbm  and to comply with other medical device requirements for that product 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval  if required  or any limitation on grafton plus tm dbm could adversely affect us 
loss of key persons could limit our success 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
we consider our allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and rely primarily on trade secrets and patents to protect our technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects which have been independently developed by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our existing or future products and technologies could be found to infringe the patents of others 
we are currently involved in three lawsuits in which we are accused of infringing patents held by others 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
our products face competitive threats from alternate technologies 
the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes as compared to allograft bone tissue is that they do not depend on the availability of donated human tissue 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and recombinant bone growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our spray coating  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition 
our plasma spray coatings  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition in europe from divisions and subsidiaries of several large corporations engaged in providing such services and products to others and from several smaller independent companies 
in addition  we also face competition from medical implant companies which have in house plasma spray coating operations 
we compete primarily on the quality of our coatings  bovine tissue products and our prices 
we believe that the spraying technology we use  which is computer controlled and utilizes robotics  enables us to provide high quality coatings at competitive prices 
you should note  however  that the industries in which we compete in europe are highly competitive  certain of our competitors have greater resources than we do  and we may be unable to compete successfully 
we may incur losses from product liability lawsuits 
the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue  bovine tissue products and the implantation of medical devices coated with our ha powder or titanium and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue they distribute which is caused by our processing 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us or all types of liabilities which may be asserted against us 
we face potential lawsuits or governmental enforcement activities based on hazardous waste we generate in our operations 
our allograft bone tissue processing in both the united states and europe generates waste materials  which  in the united states  are classified as medical waste and or hazardous waste under regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate our waste materials and dispose of them through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations in both the united states and europe 
the production of ha powder at our facility in the netherlands generates small amounts of hazardous waste  which we segregate and dispose of through a licensed hazardous waste transporter 
our failure to fully comply with any environmental regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  fines and or sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our independent sales agents and sales representatives to educate surgeons concerning our products and to market our products 
our success depends largely upon arrangements we have with independent sales agents and sales representatives whereby they educate surgeons concerning our products and market our products 
these independent sales agents and sales representatives may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent sales agents and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to attract and retain skilled independent sales agents and sale representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders or discourage a takeover 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in january   our board of directors authorized shares of series e preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series e preferred stock to holders of the common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series e preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the united states  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on short term and long term debt 
we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments or debt 
accordingly  we are subject to changes in interest rates 
based on our december  cash and cash equivalents and long term debt  a change in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately  the value of the us dollar affects our financial results 
although currently not significant  changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and net income in the future 
we do not maintain hedging programs to mitigate the potential exposures of exchange rate risk 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies in which we sell products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
based on the operating results of our foreign operations for the year ended december   a change in the exchange rates would impact our results of operations by approximately  because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance
