item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we design  manufacture  install and service high performance equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our products are focused on the wet chemical process steps in integrated circuit ic manufacturing and include systems for electrochemical deposition  wafer surface preparation and wafer transport container cleaning 
our electrochemical deposition systems are used for plating copper and gold for the ic s internal wiring  or interconnects  solder and gold bumps for wafer level packaging applications and other metals for various semiconductor and related applications 
the surface preparation systems are designed for wet cleaning  stripping and etching processes  including photoresist and polymer removal and metal etch 
typically  there are hundreds of manufacturing steps in fabricating semiconductor devices and after many of these steps a wet cleaning  stripping or etching process is required 
our customers include many of the major semiconductor device and wafer level packaging manufacturers worldwide 
we provide worldwide sales  service and support primarily through our employees located in regional offices in the united states  europe  japan  korea  and singapore and through independent sales organizations for certain products in taiwan  japan and china 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  particularly in asia with the industry trend to outsourcing ic device manufacturing to foundries in that region  although the percentage of international sales and the geographic distribution may fluctuate from period to period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy  as discussed in note to the financial statements located in item below  is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as cost of sales  installation  warranty and commission expenses 
we follow specific guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments such as the definition of a new customer environment and new acceptance criteria or if installation is perfunctory may be required in the application of our revenue policy 
inventories we write down the carrying value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and marketability based upon assumptions about future use  demand and market conditions 
if actual future use  demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory valuation write downs may be required 
warranty obligations we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  due to the cyclicality of the industries we serve or for other reasons  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of investments we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax assets we make estimates to determine the amount of our deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  in the event we were to determine that we were able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an increase in the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease in the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of net sales year ende d september  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net gain on sale of subsidiary income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net income loss we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  semy engineering  inc  on february  the cumulative effect is a result of our adopting the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with sab are not available to restate financial information for fiscal years prior to results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and change in accounting principle in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted sab retroactive to october  under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our product sales generally contain substantive customer acceptance provisions 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sales of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until acceptance 
sales of existing products into customer environments where the product has previously been accepted are treated as multiple element arrangements if multiple elements exist 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment 
as a result of implementing sab  the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition 
this change resulted in cumulative deferred revenue of million as of october   which was recorded as a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or a charge of per share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal the resulting deferred profit balance as of october  was million 
deferred profit equals the amount of system revenue that was shipped  but deferred under sab less all applicable product  warranty and commission costs 
of the million in deferred profit  the full amount was recognized in fiscal the results for the first three quarters of fiscal year ended september  have been restated in accordance with sab and are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item below 
data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with sab are not available to restate financial information for the periods before october  the change in revenue recognition does not affect our cash flow 
for fiscal  our revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue at the time of title transfer usually upon shipment to the customer 
customer service contract revenue was recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
software revenue from the our wholly owned subsidiary  semy engineering  inc was recognized when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the software had been delivered  the price was fixed and determinable  and collectibility was probable in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position software revenue recognition 
we disposed of our software subsidiary in february consolidated net sales consolidated net sales were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal fiscal consolidated net sales were million  which were reported on the historical shipment method of revenue recognition 
semiconductor equipment net sales fiscal semiconductor equipment net sales were million down from million in fiscal fiscal net sales were million  which were reported on the historical shipment method of revenue recognition 
our fiscal net sales were negatively impacted by the reduction in semiconductor manufacturers capital equipment spending in response to slowing demand for their microelectronic products and their resulting excess productive capacity 
reflecting the semiconductor industry s ongoing move to new materials and processes  fiscal net sales of our single wafer cleaning systems were more than double the prior year s level 
net sales of parts and service and electroplating systems were the least impacted by the downturn while manual and automated batch surface preparation systems had the greatest year over year decrease in net sales  as the sale of these systems is more closely associated with capacity additions 
the relative contributions of each product line to fiscal semiconductor equipment net sales were for electrochemical deposition  for cleaning  stripping and etching and for parts  service and other compared to  and for these same product categories in fiscal the geographic distribution of net sales in fiscal year was north america   europe   and asia  including japan  
while the relative proportion of international sales to total consolidated sales for fiscal is nearly unchanged from the previous fiscal year  the geographic mix has shifted 
on a combined basis  sales in japan and korea declined nearly  while the rest of asia and europe declined by lesser amounts 
the geographic distribution of net sales in fiscal year was as follows north america   europe   and asia  including japan  fiscal shipments totaled million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal shipments were essentially flat across all product lines of the semiconductor equipment segment when compared to fiscal software control systems net sales in february  we sold semy engineering  inc  the sole component of our software controls systems segment  to brooks automation  inc for million in cash and  shares of brooks automation  inc common stock and realized an after tax gain of million 
there were no software control systems net sales in fiscal year  but in fiscal net sales were million compared to million in fiscal orders backlog orders backlog decreased to million at september  from million at september  orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
in fiscal  we experienced both cancellations and the forward rescheduling of equipment delivery dates by customers 
because of these factors and orders placed and shipped in the same quarter  our orders backlog is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
deferred revenue under the sab method of revenue recognition  certain revenues and associated profit are deferred and recognized when customer acceptance is received 
deferred revenue at september  was million  essentially the same as fiscal s million  but year over year deferred profit was slightly lower at september  outlook the semiconductor equipment market s continued weakness limits our market visibility  however  it is likely that it will continue to be depressed in fiscal gross profit our gross margin for fiscal was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the year over year decrease in gross margin from fiscal is primarily attributable to reduced manufacturing overhead absorption  as a result of our lower operating levels  higher inventory obsolescence and changes in sales mix 
the gross margin decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to our lower capacity utilization in the second half of fiscal our gross margin has been and  we believe  will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the cost to manufacture  service and support new and enhanced products  inventory obsolescence  the mix and average selling prices of products sold and operating level 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for each of fiscal years  and as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were  and for the same periods 
the decrease in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of cost reductions  which includes manpower reductions and lower sales commissions 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in legal expenses associated with ongoing litigation brought by us to protect our intellectual property 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from fiscal to because we were able to leverage the fixed components of these expenses as net sales increased 
the million increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was a result of increased sales commissions due to higher net sales in fiscal and a shift in the geographical sales mix to regions with higher commissions structures 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were  and for each of these years 
the fiscal to year over year decrease in r d costs was mainly due to a reduction in employee costs as manpower was reduced in response to the industry downturn 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense  as we updated our process development and demonstration laboratories 
fiscal r d projects included enhancements to our capsule processor and electrochemical deposition products  the development of the sirius system and other projects focused on the industry technology trends toward smaller feature sizes and the transition to copper  wafer level packaging and mm 
we believe that continued timely development of products is necessary to remain competitive in an equipment market characterized by rapid technological change and we expect to maintain a high level of product development investment 
the million increase in absolute dollars in research and development in from fiscal was a result of research and development for mm product applications  enhancements across the product lines  and included new software and hardware control systems  new robotic automation systems and the development of our acms product line  which provides automated chemical management for our plating systems 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was income of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and expense of  for fiscal the primary components of other income expense  net in each of fiscal years   and were a foreign exchange gain of  a foreign exchange loss of  and a foreign exchange gain of  and interest income of  million and  which were partially offset by interest expense of   and million 
the foreign exchange gains primarily consists of net gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of our balance sheet amounts denominated in non us currencies into us dollars  which is our functional currency 
the currency exchange gains and losses were due primarily to fluctuations of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
income taxes the million income tax benefit recorded in fiscal was primarily the result of the availability of the income tax loss carrybacks and research and experimentation credits 
this tax benefit compares to a million tax provision in fiscal and an million tax provision for fiscal when the company had taxable income 
the effective income tax rate for each of fiscal years  and was   and 
the anticipated tax rate for fiscal is  but this expectation can be affected by tax legislation  geographic composition of our pretax income and research and experimentation credits as a percentage of pretax income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  were million  down million at the beginning of the year 
during fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  which contrasts with fiscal when cash provided by operations was million 
the year over year change in cash provided by operations is primarily attributable to the declining level of sales and operations and the resulting net loss due to the semiconductor equipment industry downturn 
partially offsetting the effect of the year over year decline in operating results was a net decrease of million  in accounts receivable  which reflects the substantial decline in operating levels  and income taxes refundable 
we expect future accounts receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
as is customary in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  products are generally built to fill specific customer orders  with typical order fulfillment times ranging from four to six weeks for certain products to six months or longer for more complex products 
accordingly  while our finished goods inventory accounts for of total inventory at september   overall inventory levels tend to fluctuate with the level and type of orders received and order cancellations 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  the sale of semy engineering  inc during fiscal provided million in cash proceeds 
cash used to purchase plant  property and equipment in fiscal was million and included primarily laboratory equipment and a new office building in cambridge  uk for our european headquarters 
consistent with our focus on product and process development  we further invested in our development and demonstration laboratories with a transfer of million in finished goods inventory to plant  property and equipment in fiscal  which is comparable to the million transferred in fiscal cash invested in intangible assets  which primarily consisted of intellectual property rights  was approximately million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal consisted of net repayments on short term borrowings of  and the repayment of approximately  on long term debt and capitalized leases compared to fiscal net repayments of million on our line of credit and other short term borrowings and repayments on long term debt and capital leases of  the exercise of stock options in fiscal provided  in cash compared to  in fiscal the following commitments as of september  have been included in the consolidated financial statements included under
