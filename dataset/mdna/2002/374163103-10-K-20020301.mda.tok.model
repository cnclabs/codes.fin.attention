item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the form k and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for applications in oncology and regenerative medicine and research tools for drug discovery 
our product development programs are based upon three patented core technologies telomerase  human embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer 
in january  we and pharmacia agreed to terminate our license and research collaboration agreement 
all product rights for telomerase inhibition reverted to us 
we continue our development work on compounds that inhibit telomerase for the treatment of cancer 
in august  kyowa hakko selected our compound  grn  for development as an anti cancer drug 
we and kyowa hakko are now focused on preparing and testing grn prior to initiation of human clinical trials 
the geron and kyowa hakko collaboration includes the development and marketing of telomerase inhibitors for the asian market 
we retain all rights in north america  europe and the rest of the world outside asia 
our nuclear transfer technology continues to be in demand by various companies working in the agriculture sector as well as in the production of biologicals 
in  we signed license or license option agreements with prolinia  inc  clone international pty ltd 
and agresearch pty ltd 
for improved cattle production and agreements with avigenics  inc and viragen  inc 
for improved poultry and production of biologicals 
we also signed a license with nexia biotechnologies inc for the production of synthetic silk proteins for medical and industrial uses 
with each agreement  we received license or option fees payable in cash or equity as well as share future revenues from products that use our nuclear transfer technology 
in november  an institutional investor converted all of the remaining million of series c convertible debentures plus accrued interest into  shares of our common stock 
as a result  no series c convertible debentures remain outstanding 
also in november  this institutional investor converted million of series d convertible debentures into  shares of our common stock 
we amended the terms of the remaining million of series d convertible debentures held by this investor to carry a coupon  have a fixed conversion price of per share and have the maturity date extended to june we also amended the related outstanding series d warrants to include new exercise prices and to extend the exercise periods 
in december  we sold million of our common stock under an equity line financing facility 
in january  we resolved a federal lawsuit with the wisconsin alumni research foundation and entered into a new license for the commercialization of human embryonic stem cell technology 
the new agreement supersedes the earlier license  and resolves all issues related to the lawsuit filed by warf against us in august we do not expect an adverse accounting impact on our financial condition or results of operations related to this new license agreement 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  consolidation and use of estimates to be critical policies 
revenue recognition since geron s inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from license and research agreements with collaborators 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under these collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred 
we recognize milestone fees upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments received which has not been earned 
we also have several license  option and marketing agreements with various diagnostic  research tools  agriculture and biologics production companies 
with each of these agreements  we may receive nonrefundable license payments in cash or equity securities  option payments in cash or equity securities  royalties on future sales of products  or any combination of these items 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize option payments as revenue over the period of the option agreement 
we generally recognize royalties as revenue upon receipt 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the results of geron in the united states and our wholly owned subsidiary  geron bio med ltd  a united kingdom company 
transactions and accounts between us and geron bio med have been eliminated 
we translate the assets and liabilities of geron bio med from british pounds sterling into united states dollars using foreign exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
we translate the revenues and expenses of geron bio med using average monthly foreign exchange rates 
translation adjustments are included in the balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
use of estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates include useful lives for fixed assets for depreciation calculations  estimated lives for license agreements related to deferred revenue and assumptions for valuing options and warrants 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in  and represented research support payments from our collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia 
the decrease in revenues in was a result of terminating our agreement with pharmacia in january the increase in revenues in was a result of the extension of our three way agreement with kyowa hakko and pharmacia 
we recognize revenue under collaborative agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
we received million  million and none in funding payments under the kyowa hakko agreement in  and  respectively 
we recognized million in fiscal and million each in fiscal and in revenue for funding payments received under the pharmacia agreement 
we expect revenues under collaborative agreements to decrease in the future as a result of contractually agreed reduced research funding from kyowa hakko 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with diagnostics  research tools  agriculture  biologics production and cancer immunotherapy 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination 
we recognized license and option fee revenues of  and  in and  respectively related to our various agreements 
no license or option fees were recognized in also  we received royalties of   and  in  and  respectively on product sales of telomerase diagnostic kits to the research use only market and cell based research products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in   in   in   in and  thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future results 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased scientific personnel expenses of million  increased sponsored research of  and increased scientific supplies of million 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased contract research expenses of million  increased license fees for research technology of  and higher scientific supplies of  we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as a result of the continued development of our therapeutic and diagnostic programs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of the our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase   and clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings and sponsored research at academic and research institutions 
future research and development expenses would also include costs related to clinical trials 
currently  our lead oncology development product  grn  is in animal studies 
upon conclusive results from those animal studies  we expect to enter phase clinical studies with this product in we are currently sponsoring a phase clinical study at duke university medical center for a telomerase immunotherapy for patients with prostate cancer 
the results of this study will be evaluated in and future clinical progress of this product will depend on the study results 
we plan to begin testing several cell types differentiated from human embryonic stem cells in animal models of disease in  including neurons for the treatment of parkinson s disease and cardiomyocytes for the treatment of heart disease 
if these tests are successful  we will continue clinical development of these products in accordance with fda guidelines 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the section titled because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
acquired in process research technology expenses acquired in process research technology expenses were the result of the acquisition of roslin bio med in may we used the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the purchase price between the acquired basic research in the form of a license to the nuclear transfer technology  the research agreement with the roslin institute and the net tangible assets of roslin bio med 
we expensed the value of the nuclear transfer technology of million as acquired research in process technology expense and capitalized the value of the research agreement of million as an intangible asset 
the total purchase price of million also included acquisition costs of million 
the license to the nuclear transfer technology was the only significant asset of roslin bio med 
we intend to enhance the research and development of the nuclear transfer technology by combining it with our other technology platforms 
future products  if any  may take several years to develop and commercialize and will require substantial additional funds 
we may never be able to create a commercial product from the nuclear transfer technology 
we concluded that this technology had no alternative future use  and accordingly  expensed the value of the acquired research in process technology at the time of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was the result of a net increase in personnel related costs of  and legal expenses of  offset by reduced business consulting expenses of million 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased business consulting expenses of million 
we do not expect general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in the near future 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and decreasing cash and investment balances 
the increase in and was due to higher average cash and investment balances as a result of investing proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities in and interest earned in the future will depend on any future funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we also received   and million in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense for was primarily the result of lower expenses related to convertible debentures 
the increase in interest and other expense in over was primarily the result of the various convertible debenture financings during in connection with the issuance of series d convertible debentures in june  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in addition  we recorded the million value of the warrant issued with the series d convertible debentures as a charge to interest expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
at the end of  we adopted a new accounting principle as required by the financial accounting standards board 
this new principle required us to modify the way we calculated the interest expense recognized for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the closing date of the convertible debenture financing and the conversion price of the debentures 
we were required to apply this new accounting principle retroactively to the september series c convertible debenture issuance 
as a result of adopting this new accounting principle  we recognized million in imputed non cash interest expense and have recorded this charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in connection with the issuance of series c convertible debentures in september  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in addition  we recognized  in interest expense related to a potential penalty on redemption up through the date our stockholders authorized the additional shares to be issued for the full conversion of the series c convertible debentures and the exercise of the series c warrants 
we determined the value of the series c warrants to be million 
we recorded this value as an increase to additional paid in capital with a related charge to interest expense 
conversion expense in connection with the restructuring agreement for our series d convertible debentures in november  we modified the terms of million of our outstanding series d convertible debentures by reducing the conversion price to of the closing bid price on the date of conversion by the investor and  as a result  we recorded million as conversion expense 
the conversion expense was calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the common stock issued on the date of conversion and the fair market value of common stock that would have been issued under the original agreement 
we also modified the terms of the remaining million of our series d convertible debentures to extend the maturity date to june   increase the yield on the debenture to  and fix the conversion price at per share 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related warrants that were originally issued with our series d convertible debentures to reset the exercise price of of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to june  series d warrants and of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to december  series d warrants 
the difference between the current fair values of the original series d warrants and the amended series d and d warrants was recorded as conversion expense of million 
we also recorded the remaining million of the amended series d convertible debentures at a fair value of million with the offsetting difference of million being recorded as conversion expense 
the excess of the fair value over the face value of the debentures is being amortized over the life of the debentures as a reduction of interest expense  in 
we are also accruing interest on the amended debentures as interest expense over the life of the debentures  in 
the fair values used in calculating the conversion expense associated with the series d and d warrants and the amended series d convertible debentures were based on values determined through an independent valuation 
net loss losses before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net losses after cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of higher operating expenses  conversion expense related to amending series d convertible debentures and warrants  decreased revenues from collaborative agreements and reduced interest expense and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the net loss for was the net result of increased operating expenses  interest expense and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle which was offset by the decrease in acquisition costs from which included the charge for acquired in process research technology in connection with the acquisition of roslin bio med and the amortization of the research funding obligation to the roslin institute 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was the result of cash used in operations 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was primarily the result of the exercise of warrants  the sale of equity to a private investor and the sale of convertible debentures 
net cash used in operations was million in and million in the increase in net cash used in operations in was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses 
cash used in operations in was primarily the result of the net loss for the year of million offset partially by non cash charges including million of interest arising from the beneficial conversion feature of convertible debentures and the value of warrants issued with convertible debentures 
we expect that our net cash used in operations will increase in as a result of increased research and development expenses 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through an equipment financing arrangement 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our equipment financing facility 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facility expires on august  we intend to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  then we will need to spend our own resources for equipment purchases 
in january  we and pharmacia agreed to terminate our license and research collaboration agreement 
all product rights for telomerase inhibition reverted to us 
we will seek further funding through other strategic collaborations  public or private equity financing  or other financing sources 
in  we received million from kyowa hakko as a result of the extension signed in kyowa hakko is not contractually obligated to provide any further research funding 
in september  we sold million in series c convertible two percent coupon debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to an institutional investor 
the series c convertible debentures were convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
in march  million of principal of series c convertible debentures converted into approximately  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of all of the series c warrants 
in november  all of the remaining million of series c convertible debentures plus accrued interest were converted by the holder into approximately  shares of our common stock 
as of december   no series c convertible debentures and no series c warrants were outstanding 
in june  we sold million in series d zero coupon convertible debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor 
the debentures were convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
if unconverted  the debentures had a maturity date of june  the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercisable at per share at the option of the holder through december in november  million of series d convertible debentures were converted by the holder into approximately  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  reflecting a modification of the terms of these debentures 
we amended the terms of the remaining million of series d convertible debentures to carry a coupon  have a fixed conversion price of per share and have the maturity date extended to june we also amended the outstanding series d warrants 
the amended series d warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock is exercisable at per share through june  the amended series d warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock is exercisable at per share through december  as of december   million of series d convertible debentures and series d and d warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock remained outstanding 
in september  we entered into an agreement with an institutional investor for an equity financing facility covering the sale of up to million of our common stock over months 
the shares will be sold at our discretion at a discount to the then current market price of our common stock on the day of sale 
we control the amount and timing of each sale of stock 
in october  we sold million of our common stock under the equity line financing facility and issued approximately  shares 
in december  we sold million of our common stock under our equity line financing facility and issued approximately  shares 
as of december   million remains available under the equity line 
this line expires in september our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter are as follows principal payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total amounts in thousands convertible debentures   equipment loans  operating leases   research funding     total contractual cash obligations     this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
our convertible debentures may be converted to common stock prior to their maturity date  therefore may not require use of our capital resources 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facilities will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least june  changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources that may be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about geron s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate and municipal notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
for the fiscal year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  the financial obligations of geron to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next four years 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
