item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified below the accounting principles critical to our business and results of operations 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we discuss these accounting policies at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we install the majority of the equipment we sell 
revenues for company installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon receipt of a signed sales contract and delivery and acceptance certificate 
the delivery and acceptance certificate confirms that the product has been delivered  installed  accepted  is in good working condition  and is satisfactory for the intended purposes 
revenues for customer installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon receipt of a sales contract and delivery 
the company does not offer any equipment warranties in addition to those which are provided by the equipment manufacturer 
revenues for sales of supplies are recognized at time of shipment following the placement of an order from a customer 
revenues for monthly equipment service and facilities management service are recognized in the month in which the service is performed 
revenues for other services and rentals are recognized in the period performed 
the present value of payments due under sales type lease contracts is recorded as revenue within net sales and cost of goods sold is charged with the book value of the equipment when products are delivered to and accepted by the customer 
finance income is recognized over the related lease term 
supporting the company s objective to provide complete solutions to its customers  the company generally sells a service agreement when copier printer equipment is sold 
the typical agreement includes a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
revenue for each element of a bundled contract is derived from our national price lists for equipment and service 
the national price list for equipment includes a price range between the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp and the minimum price for which our sales force is permitted to sell equipment 
the price list for equipment is updated monthly to reflect any vendor communicated changes in msrp and any changes in the fair value for which equipment is being sold to customers 
the national price list for service reflects the price of service charged to customers 
the price list for service is updated quarterly to reflect new service offerings and any changes in the competitive environment affecting the fair value for which service is being provided to customers 
the national price list  therefore  is representative of the fair value of each element of a bundled agreement when it is sold unaccompanied by the other elements 
revenue for a bundled contract is first allocated to service revenue using the fair value per our national price list 
the remaining revenue is allocated to equipment revenue and finance income based on a net present value calculation utilizing an appropriate interest rate that considers the creditworthiness of the customer and costs of financing 
the equipment revenue is compared to the national price list 
if the equipment revenue falls within the price range per the national price list  no adjustment is required 
if equipment revenue is not within the price range per the national price list  service and equipment revenues are proportionately adjusted while holding the interest rate constant  so that both service and equipment revenues fall within the price range per the national price list 

table of contents goodwill 
ikon evaluates goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of the goodwill is then compared to its carrying amount to determine impairment 
if future discounted cash flows are less favorable than those anticipated  goodwill may be impaired 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
ikon writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
allowances for receivables 
ikon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and lease defaults for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of ikon s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  increases to our allowances may be required 
income taxes 
income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas  which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of liabilities and assets using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas also provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
in assessing the valuation allowance  ikon has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
however  in the event ikon determines that the value of a deferred tax asset has fluctuated from its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary 
pension 
certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if actual results are less favorable than those assumed  additional pension expense may be required 
residual values 
ikon estimates the residual value of equipment sold under sales type leases 
our residual values are based on the dollar value of the equipment 
residual values generally range between to of retail price  depending on equipment model and lease term 
we evaluate residual values quarterly for impairment 
changes in market conditions could cause actual residual values to differ from estimated values  which could accelerate write down of the value of the equipment 
our preparation of this form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
results of operations this discussion reviews the results of operations of the company as reported in the consolidated statements of income 
all dollar and share amounts are in thousands 
fiscal compared to fiscal our revenues decreased by  or  compared to fiscal this resulted in part from the impact of our actions to exit  sell or downsize certain non strategic businesses during fiscal  which accounted for approximately  of the decline 
excluding the impact of these downsizing actions  revenues for fiscal were down approximately 

table of contents net sales  which includes the sale of copier printer equipment  supplies  and technology hardware  decreased by  or  compared to fiscal sales of technology hardware  such as computers  routers and servers  decreased by approximately  or  as the company continues to de emphasize this offering as part of its margin improvement strategy  choosing instead to redirect its technical capabilities to services that support other customer opportunities  including document management and digital connectivity 
sales of copier printer equipment decreased by approximately  or  due to ongoing economic pressures as well as the company s strategic focus on moving from low end  lower margin products to high end  higher margin products 
high end segment and equipment equipment with minimum page output of over pages per minute sales increased by over  compared to fiscal  partially offsetting decreases in revenue from the sale of lower segment equipment 
supply sales decreased by approximately  or  due to competitive market pressures and a decline in supply consumption resulting from the transition from analog to digital technology 
in fiscal  approximately of copier printer equipment revenues were from sales of segment and products  compared to approximately in fiscal services revenue  which consists of revenue from the servicing of copier printer equipment and outsourcing and other services  such as facilities management  digital print production  legal document services  e business and other services  and rentals decreased by  or  compared to fiscal approximately  of this decline is due to the downsizing  sale  and closure of non strategic outsourcing and other services businesses during fiscal revenues from the servicing of copier printer equipment were flat year over year 
outsourcing and other services accounted for the remaining decline  down approximately for the year 
finance income increased by  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to continued growth in the net lease portfolio of approximately compared to fiscal finance income is generated by ikon s wholly owned leasing subsidiaries 
iosc  ikon s leasing subsidiary in the united states  accounted for approximately of ikon s finance income for fiscal approximately of ikon north america s copier and equipment revenues were financed by iosc during fiscal  compared to approximately during fiscal effective fiscal  income generated through iosc s administrative infrastructure  such as syndication fees  late fees and other processing related revenue  is reported as services rather than within finance income 
costs associated with these income generating activities have been reclassified from selling and administrative expenses to services costs 
to conform with the current year presentation  the amounts reclassified for fiscal were  of revenue and  of cost 
there is no impact on operating income  net income or earnings per share as a result of this change 
gross margin was  compared to in fiscal the gross margin on net sales decreased to from in fiscal  primarily due to less favorable revenue mix resulting from a decrease in supply sales 
the gross margin on services increased to  compared to in fiscal  due to improved productivity in the servicing of copier printer equipment 
the gross margin on finance income increased to from in fiscal primarily due to higher average portfolio yields and lower average borrowing rates 
the average financing rates on our lease receivables were approximately  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
additionally  our finance subsidiaries average cost of debt was approximately  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was  compared to in fiscal selling and administrative expense decreased by  or  compared to fiscal of this decrease  approximately  was due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  approximately  was due to the company s exit from its telephony and technology education operations and the closure of certain digital print centers and approximately  was due to our centralization and consolidation initiatives  decreased selling costs resulting from lower sales of equipment and decreased sales and support costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reversed   after tax  or per share on a diluted basis of its restructuring charges described below 
the reversed charges consisted of  related to 
table of contents severance   related to leasehold termination costs and  related to contractual commitments 
the severance reversal was the result of the average cost of severance per employee being less than estimated and fewer positions eliminated than estimated due to voluntary resignations and our decision not to close a digital print center due to changing business dynamics 
the reversal of leasehold termination costs and contractual commitments resulted from our decision not to close a digital print center 
additionally  we were also able to reduce our liability through successful equipment and real property lease termination negotiations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced the acceleration of certain cost cutting and infrastructure improvements as described below and recorded a pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charge of  and reserve adjustments related primarily to the exit of the company s telephony operations of  the related reserve adjustments were included in cost of goods sold for the write off of obsolete inventory and selling and administrative expense for the write off of accounts receivable in the consolidated statement of income 
the asset impairments included fixed asset write offs totaling  as follows from technology services businesses closures  from digital print center business closures  from digital print center business sales  and  relating to ikon infrastructure 
the asset impairments also included goodwill write offs totaling  as follows from technology services business closures   from digital print center business sales  and  relating to telephony business sales 
the company developed this plan as part of our continuing effort to streamline ikon s infrastructure to increase future productivity  and to address economic changes within specific marketplaces 
this resulted in a charge of   after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
these actions addressed the sale of the company s telephony operations and the closing of twelve non strategic digital print centers as the company shifts its focus from transactional work toward contract print work and the support of major accounts 
these actions also addressed further downsizing of operational infrastructures throughout the organization as the company leverages and intensifies prior standardization and centralization initiatives 
these actions included the ongoing centralization and consolidation of many selling and administrative functions  including marketplace consolidation  supply chain  finance  customer service  sales support and the realignment of sales coverage against our long term growth objectives 
additionally  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of   after tax  or per share on a diluted basis related to the sale of the company s technology education operations 
the asset impairments included fixed asset write offs totaling the asset impairments also included goodwill write offs totaling  therefore  the aggregate charge recorded in fiscal the fiscal charge was   after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the fiscal charge and the related actions taken resulted in a decline of approximately  in revenues and an increase in operating income of approximately  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced plans to improve performance and efficiency and incurred a total pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charge the first quarter charge of   after tax  or per share on a basic and diluted basis

plans included consolidating or disposing of certain under performing and non core locations  implementing productivity enhancements through the consolidation and centralization of activities in inventory management  purchasing  finance accounting and other administrative functions  and consolidating real estate through the co location of business units as well as the disposition of unproductive real estate 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that some first quarter restructuring initiatives would not require the level of 
table of contents spending that had been originally estimated  and certain other initiatives would not be implemented due to changing business dynamics 
previously targeted sites were maintained based on their potential for improvement as well as their relationship to ikon s overall strategic direction 
as a result of our integration efforts  locations originally identified for sale or closure were combined with other ikon businesses 
as a result   was reversed from the first quarter charge  and the total amount of the first quarter charge was reduced to   after tax  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
the components of the reversal were fewer positions eliminated reduced severance by  real estate lease payments reduced by  and contractual commitments reduced by the severance reversal resulted from successfully negotiating business sales whereby affected employees assumed positions with the acquiring companies  higher than expected voluntary resignations  and our decision not to implement certain supply chain and shared service center consolidation efforts 
the real estate lease payment reversal was primarily the result of our decision not to close certain sites 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced other specific actions designed to address the changing market conditions impacting technology services  ikon north america  and outsourcing locations and incurred a total pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charge the fourth quarter charge of   after tax  or per share on a basic and diluted basis

table of contents adoption of sfas effective october  the completion of certain tax planning initiatives during the first quarter of fiscal also contributed to the reduced tax rate 
the initiatives completed included the conversion of iosc from a corporation to a limited liability company llc and the designation of the ikon stock fund in the company s retirement savings plan as an employee stock ownership plan esop 
the conversion to an llc allows the company  for state income tax purposes  to combine current year taxable income and losses that were previously reported separately  which results in the reduction of state income taxes 
the esop designation allows the company to deduct dividends on ikon common stock that participants and beneficiaries in the company s retirement savings plan can elect to receive in cash 
the company s valuation allowance was  and  at september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the removal of valuation allowances due to the expiration of the carryforward period for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards 
this decrease had no impact on our effective income tax rate 
in fiscal  we recognized a gain of   after tax related to net favorable dispositions of environmental matters at locations we had previously accounted for as discontinued operations 
the gain has been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income 
diluted earnings per common share were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal excluding the special items noted above  and the gain from discontinued operations  diluted earnings per common share were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the diluted earnings per common share calculation for fiscal reflects the impact of the convertible notes see financial condition and liquidity 
the company accounts for the effect of the convertible notes in the diluted earnings per common share calculation using the if converted method 
under that method  the convertible notes are assumed to be converted to shares weighted for the number of days outstanding in the period at a conversion price of  and interest expense  net of taxes  related to the convertible notes is added back to net income 
assuming the impact of not amortizing goodwill and excluding the special items noted above  diluted earnings per common share for fiscal would have been in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas sfas supercedes apb  intangible assets  and primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
the provisions of sfas were effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the most significant changes made by sfas were goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
effective october   the company adopted sfas  which requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
sfas prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of the goodwill is then compared to its carrying amount to determine impairment 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
as of september   the company completed its annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
the company has identified the following reporting units and associated goodwill ikon north america copier business ikon north america outsourcing business ikon europe business imaging services sysinct e business development total goodwill at september  changes in the goodwill balance since september  are attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments 
as of september   there are no intangible assets that are required to be amortized by sfas
