as new markets open  rogue wave intends to expand partnerships with leading vendors to offer solutions to the marketplace 
product support the company believes that a high level of customer support is important to the successful marketing and sale of its products 
mission critical applications require rapid support response and problem resolution 
the company s worldwide sales and support presence allows quick response and support in local languages 
the company delivers support services through various channels such as telephone  electronic mail and on line support via the web

upgrade service offering companies a way to smoothly transition to new versions of rogue wave products 
as of november   there were employees in the professional services group helping development teams implement stable  flexible and reliable applications 
product development the company s future success will depend on its ability to satisfy diverse and evolving customer requirements and otherwise achieve market acceptance 
rogue wave will strive to continue to enhance its current product line while developing new  market driven product offerings that keep pace with competitive product introductions and new technologies 
during fiscal year  the company s product development activities were conducted in various sites throughout the united states  including corvallis  oregon  boulder  colorado  and southboro  massachusetts 
as of november   there were employees on the company s product development staff 
the company s product development expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented   and of total revenue  respectively 
the company expects that it will continue to commit substantial resources to product development in the future 
although rogue wave has primarily developed products internally  it may  based on timing and cost considerations  acquire technologies or products from third parties 
additionally  the company is investigating certain offshore development opportunities  which it expects to make a final determination by december competition the company s products and professional services contend with direct and indirect competition ranging from the internal development operations of our target customers to similar product offerings and alternative technologies designed to address the same business problems 
rogue wave stingray studio targets developers using visual c mfc microsoft foundation classes  and visual basic activex software components for gui development on windows platforms 
microsoft is a particularly strong competitor due to its large installed base and the fact that it bundles its mfc library with its own and other c compilers 
microsoft is promoting the 
net development environment  however  it is expected that the migration from mfc based applications to 
net may take up to five years to complete 
microsoft is taking a tangible step in this direction with the introduction of the 
net development environment and winforms 
winforms is positioned as microsoft s preferred method of performing gui development in the future and represents a divergence from mfc  the technologies on which stingray studio is based 
the company s sourcepro c products drive the majority of company revenue and target the maturing market for c development components 
direct competitors in the c market include microsoft with its mfc  ilog  several privately held companies  and the open source development community 

table of contents the most significant threat to revenue for the cross platform foundation c components comes from internal development operations within the company s customer and prospect base 
additional threats come from specialized c component vendors and  increasingly  open source projects that produce freely available source code upon which companies can build enterprise software 
products and services that are indirectly competitive include components from microsoft  oracle  and borland 
each of these companies provides or may provide in the future solutions that may compete with rogue wave s object oriented  distributed computing and database access products 
additional indirect competition comes from the emergence of java as a viable object oriented  cross platform enterprise development language 
the java development kit is freely distributed by sun microsystems and contains a comprehensive set of foundation and gui components upon which a developer may begin development 
higher level java centric products  such as application servers provided by sun microsystems iplanet  ibm websphere and bea web logic  also represent alternative technologies that can compete with the company s sourcepro c components 
systems integrators compete with rogue wave consulting offerings  although they tend to bring industry specific expertise rather than architectural level expertise to software development projects 
many systems integrators possess industry specific expertise that may enable them to offer a single vendor solution more easily  and already have a reputation among potential customers for offering enterprise wide solutions to software programming needs 
systems integrators may market competitive software products in the future 
employees as of november   the company had employees  of which were based in the united states  were based in europe and were based in asia pacific

the company has not experienced any work stoppages and considers relations with its employees to be good 
risk factors in evaluating the company s business  investors should carefully consider the following factors in addition to the other information presented in this report 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and actual financial results may vary from our expectations  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our future operating results are difficult to predict due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include overall economic conditions of the us and the rest of the world  overall economic conditions in the software and information systems  telecommunications  financial services and defense industries  the demand for our products and services  the level of product and price competition  the size  type and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  levels of international sales  obsolescence of our products or the programming languages that our products are designed to enhance  changes in our pricing policy or that of our competitors  publication of opinions about us  our products and object oriented and infrastructure component technology by industry analysts  our ability to retain key employees and hire new employees  our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  and our ability to effectively deploy our new strategy including our new business model 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any 
table of contents given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based on the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
our sales volume is subject to fluctuations and unpredictable timing and may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
we generally ship orders as received  which means that quarterly revenue and operating results depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders we receive during the quarter 
sales volume is difficult to forecast due to a number of reasons  many of which are outside our control 
such reasons include lack of a reliable means to assess overall customer demand  we typically earn a substantial portion of our revenue in the last weeks  or even days  of each quarter  larger customer orders are subject to long sales cycles and are frequently delayed  and our service and maintenance revenue tends to fluctuate as consulting contracts are undertaken  renewed  completed or terminated 
we base operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed 
as a result  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could lead to significant losses 
accordingly  operating results and growth rates for any particular quarter or other fiscal period may not be indicative of future operating results 
furthermore  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
our failure to manage planned growth could adversely affect our ability to increase revenue 
our business has evolved significantly in recent years  placing a strain on our management systems and resources 
to manage future growth  we must continue to improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage our employee work force 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to attract and retain key employees will adversely affect our business 
our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom is bound by an employment agreement 
we believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel are essential to establishing and maintaining a leadership position  particularly in light of the fact that our intellectual property  once sold to the public market  is easily replicated 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulty in attracting key personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain key employees or that we can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
variability of our sales cycles make it difficult to forecast quarterly and annual revenue and operating results  making it likely that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful as an indicator of future results 
we distribute our products primarily through two different direct sales channels  a telesales force and a field sales force  each of which is subject to a variable sales cycle 
products sold by our telesales force may be sold after a single phone call or may require several weeks of education and negotiation before a sale is made 
as such  the sales cycle associated with telesales typically ranges from a few days to two months 
on the other hand  the purchase of products from our field sales force is often an enterprise wide decision and may require the sales person to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the sale of our products through our field sales force typically ranges from two to six months and is subject to a number of significant delays over which we have little or no control 
as a result  quarterly revenue and operating results are variable and are difficult to forecast  and we believe that period to period comparisons of quarterly revenue are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future revenue 

table of contents we face risks involving future business acquisitions 
we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary technologies  products or businesses 
future acquisitions may result in the diversion of management s attention from the day to day operations of our business and may include numerous other risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  products and personnel of the acquired companies 
future acquisitions may also result in a dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
our failure to successfully manage future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
doing business outside the united states involves numerous factors that could negatively affect our financial results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources 
to service the needs of our international customers  we must provide worldwide product support services 
we have expanded  and intend to continue expanding  our international operations and plan to enter additional international markets 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations  economic or political instability  shipping delays and increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
the nature of many of our products requires the release of the source code to customers 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar technology 
although we do not believe that we are infringing any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business will suffer if our products contain defects or do not function as intended  which would cause our revenue to decline 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
also  new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors  or bugs  or performance problems that  despite testing  are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
errors or performance 
table of contents problems could cause delays in product introduction and shipments or require design modifications  either of which could lead to a loss in revenue or increase in costs 
our products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we expect that our customers and potential customers have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
despite extensive testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  the payment of monetary damages  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we cannot predict whether the market acceptance for c and visual c mfc will continue to grow 
our product lines are designed for use in object oriented software application development 
to date  a substantial majority of our revenue has been attributable to sales of products and related maintenance and consulting services associated with c programming and development 
we believe that  while the market for object oriented technology is maturing  optimization of the c solutions through realignment of products and services coupled with the pursuit of unsaturated markets in asia pacific  europe and latin america  will serve to enhance future revenue 
however  object oriented programming languages are very complex and the number of software developers using them is relatively small compared to the number of developers using other software development technology 
our financial performance will depend in part upon continued growth in object oriented technology and markets and the development of standards that our products address 
there can be no assurance that the market will continue to grow or that we will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of the market 
our market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our ability to grow our business or even maintain revenue and operating results at current levels will be diminished 
our products target the markets for visual c mfc and visual basic activex software parts and programming tools 
direct competitors in the c market include microsoft with its mfc  ilog and several privately held companies 
microsoft is a particularly strong competitor due to its large installed base and the fact that it bundles its mfc library with its own and other c compilers 
microsoft may decide in the future to devote more resources to or broaden the functions of mfc in order to address and more effectively compete with the functionality of our products 
software applications can also be developed using software parts and programming tools in environments other than c 
indirect competitors with such offerings include microsoft  borland and oracle 
many of these competitors have significantly greater resources  name recognition and larger installed bases of customers than rogue wave 
these potential competitors have well established relationships with current and potential customers and have the resources to enable them to more easily offer a single vendor solution 
as a result  these potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than rogue wave can 
we also face competition from systems integrators and our customers internal information technology departments 
many systems integrators possess industry specific expertise that may enable them to offer a single vendor solution more easily  and already have a reputation among potential customers for offering enterprise wide solutions to software programming needs 
systems integrators may market competitive software products in the future 
there are many factors that may increase competition in the market for object oriented software parts and programming tools  including entry of new competitors  alliances among existing competitors and consolidation in the software industry 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we cannot compete successfully against current and future competitors or overcome competitive pressures  our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we operate in an industry with rapidly changing technology and  if we do not successfully modify our products to incorporate new technologies  they may become obsolete and sales will suffer 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  rogue wave must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of our products that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer 
table of contents requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents represents the impairment of goodwill associated with the noblenet acquisition  following the decision by the company to discontinue the nouveau product line 
stingray  which was acquired utilizing the pooling of interests accounting method  was a subchapter s corporation since inception july  until december  and  accordingly  not subject to federal and state income taxes during the year and a portion of fiscal pro forma net income reflects federal and state income taxes as if the company and stingray had been a c corporation  based on effective tax rates during the periods indicated 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rogue wave software  inc was founded in to provide reusable software components for the development of object oriented software applications 
the company operated as a subchapter s corporation until june in october  rogue wave merged with inmark development corporation  a privately held corporation specializing in the development  distribution and support of an object oriented graphical user interface library written in the c programming language 
in february  the company merged with stingray software  inc  a privately held corporation specializing in the development and distribution of object oriented development tools for windows programmers and is a leading provider of visual c class libraries 
both transactions were accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
in march  the company merged with noblenet  inc  in a transaction utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
noblenet specialized in building and marketing software products that allow existing information technology systems to communicate and interoperate across corporate networks and the internet 
following the fourth quarter decision to discontinue marketing of the noveau product line  the investment in noblenet  which consisted primarily of goodwill  was written off in fiscal in addition  during fiscal  as a part of an ongoing effort to optimize its corporate organizational structure and in conjunction with continuing cost containment programs  the company restructured its stingray business unit and discontinued the fornova project 
the stingray products  which primarily consist of development tools for windows programmers  continue to be sold by the company 
as a result of these decisions  the company recognized a restructuring charge as well as various other one time costs in fiscal and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  the company has marketed its products primarily through its direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through the internet and an indirect channel consisting of original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers  dealers and distributors 
the company s direct sales force consists of an inside telesales group that focuses on smaller orders  or less  and an outside sales force that focuses on larger enterprise wide technology customers 
the company makes all of its products available for sale and distribution over the internet 
revenue through this channel has not been significant to date  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing its products through this channel 
the rogue wave strategy and business model rogue wave s strategic objective is to provide technology and services that allow customers to optimize productivity when building software solutions to address their business requirements 
the company strives to create products that efficiently and effectively align underlying information technology with a customers application of that technology 
core technology sourcepro c the company s history is rich in object oriented c  the language of choice for large scale  business critical applications 
during fiscal  rogue wave announced the launch of the sourcepro c product line  reflecting a substantive alteration to the company s core products and business model from a license per developer approach to a customer value model 
the sourcepro c products  which integrate the majority of formerly offered rogue wave c component technology as well as features not previously available  are designed to provide more comprehensive solutions while optimizing the use of the company s core c products 
sourcepro c is comprised of four products sourcepro core  sourcepro db  sourcepro net and sourcepro analysis 
pricing of the sourcepro c products is based on a customer value model  which considers scope of deployment  including operating systems 
this model allows customers greater flexibility in their utilization of the company s products 
additionally  the company has made significant investments in java and xml initiatives 
evolution of the market place has created the need for higher order solutions 
customers are less interested in atomic software components and more interested in technology suites and frameworks that address a higher percentage of their needs 
customer purchasing practices have migrated away from the individual developer  with a greater focus on project  division or enterprise requirements 
further  to better position itself in the market  the company is also aggressively pursuing partnership opportunities with leading technology companies 
we believe that rogue wave s technological history is deep and highly regarded by its clients and the technological community 
by better aligning the company s current products  and more importantly its product development efforts  with the world s leading companies  rogue wave expects to have greater success building solutions that solve real world business problems that meet its customers needs 

table of contents strategic realignment globalization during fiscal  rogue wave continued to solidify its worldwide presence 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company announced a realignment of its strategy to include an aggressive focus on expansion in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
in conjunction with this action and to better align its cost structure with its new international business focus  on march   the company announced plans to restructure certain areas of its global operations  which resulted in severance related charges of  and  in the second and third fiscal quarter of  respectively 
these cost reductions  which resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately employees or  are expected to reduce future operating expenses by approximately million quarterly  or of total expenses 
all related severance expenses were paid in the third fiscal quarter of additionally  as part of this restructuring plan and to better meet the needs of our customers  the company has established three separate regional operations  the americas  emea and asia pacific in an effort to drive autonomy and greater accountability 
during the second fiscal quarter of  the company opened an office in australia and increased its resources in emea and other areas of the asia pacific region 
in the third quarter  the company began the process of establishing several new distributor arrangements 
as a part of the strategy to move into new international markets  the company is creating a streamlined license and packaging process to be utilized by these new distributor channels 
the company anticipates further expansion in foreign countries  including within the asia pacific markets  and expects that international license and service and maintenance revenue will account for an increasing portion of its total revenue in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
see risk factors for additional risk factors associated with the company s global expansion 
large scale object solutions lsos is a set of technologies the company developed to target customers with specific needs related to running very high throughput systems deployed against a relational database 
lsos offers services such as hierarchical object model  object history  object reconciliation and a method for storing objects on relational databases in order to maximize performance 
the company s first implementation of this technology was an application that the company developed  in partnership with jpmorgan chase  known as global market reference data and renamed cornerstonest 
the company planned to market this product to worldwide financial institutions that are facing t issues 
the second implementation of lsos technology is synopticast 
synopticast is a framework producer platform that enables the quick development of very high performance data dissemination applications that consume  store  manipulate and distribute mission critical enterprise data in real time  while preserving transactional integrity  maintaining history and audit trails and ensuring continuous availability 
initial development of this product was completed in november because of global economic uncertainties  which have resulted in significant spending constraints for information technology organizations  and the recent elimination of the t compliance requirements by the securities industry association  the company is reexamining the marketplace opportunities for cornerstonest and synopticast 
although the company plans to continue to market and sell these products to potential customers that it has identified  it has suspended all future investment related to these products

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified the critical accounting policies 
table of contents and judgments and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from licenses of its software products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
license  maintenance and most services are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 which permits revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the company defines each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
related to all sales transactions  rogue wave s customary practice is to execute a written contract  signed by both the customer and the company  or obtain a purchase order issued by the customer  depending on the type of sale 
delivery 
the company s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon the shipment of the product or delivery of the authorization code 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
rogue wave negotiates the fee for its products at the outset of an arrangement 
in these arrangements  the majority of the development licenses are perpetual and nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due within one to months depending on the length of the contract 
the company considers fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
new and existing customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and their ability to pay 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with the company s credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
sop no 
 as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangement involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the vsoe for license  consulting and training fees is established when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates with revenue recognized for remaining delivered items using the residual method as provided for by sop no 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from licenses is recognized upon delivery 
maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service periods  which are typically one to three years 
consulting services  which include training  are not considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
the revenue allocable to the consulting services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
in instances where the company enters into customized software consulting contracts  the fees are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of the products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing the estimated sales returns in any accounting period 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  the company considers factors such as customer credit history  overall and industry economic conditions and the customer s current financial performance 
rogue wave performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s 
table of contents current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from the customers 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  rogue wave is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves preparing estimates of the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
rogue wave records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future anticipated taxable income levels 
the company has reported net operating losses for the past years  in part due to cost restructuring efforts coupled with an overall continued decline in revenue 
as a result  the company determined that it did not meet the applicable accounting requirements for such assets and  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  increased its income tax valuation allowance by approximately million through a charge to income 
if  in the future  the company were to determine that such standards are met  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk exposure is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and its impact on short term investments and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

table of contents as of september   the company had short term investments of million  which are classified as held to maturity and are carried at their amortized cost 
all investments have acquired maturities of less than days 
short term investments consist primarily of high credit and highly liquid corporate notes and commercial paper 
a reduction in overall interest rates would not have a material affect on the fair value of the investments or the financial position of the company 
exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of natural hedges  whereby funding obligations and assets are both managed in the local currency 
in addition  the company will from time to time enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates  primarily in the euro 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an appropriate range of potential rate fluctuations to the company s assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currencies 
based on the company s overall foreign currency rate exposure at september   movements in foreign currency rates would not materially affect the financial position of the company 
at september  and  the company had outstanding short term forward exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars in the amount of million and million  respectively
