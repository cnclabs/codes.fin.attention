item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the reported results of metropolitan primarily reflect the operations of metropolitan bank and the financing activities of the company 
our results of operations are dependent on a variety of factors  including the general interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the industry  governmental policies and regulations and conditions in the markets for financial assets 
like most financial institutions  the primary contributor to our income is net interest income  the difference between the interest we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
our operations are also affected by noninterest income  such as loan servicing fees  servicing charges on deposit accounts  and gains or losses on the sales of loans and securities 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  and general and administrative expenses 
as a result of the performance of the company  on july   the company entered into a supervisory agreement with the ots  which requires us to prepare and adopt a plan for raising capital that uses sources other than increased debt or which requires additional dividends from metropolitan bank 
additionally  the bank entered into a separate supervisory agreement with the ots and the odfi on july  we  as well as metropolitan bank  are working to comply with all of the provisions of the supervisory agreements 
see item business supervisory agreements on page for details of the agreements and a discussion of progress to date on the requirements of the plans 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income for the year ended december  decreased million to a net loss of million as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net interest income decreased million and the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in the prior year 
noninterest income increased million for the year ended december  over the same period in the prior year and noninterest expense increased million compared to the same period in the prior year 
noninterest expense amounted to million for the year ended december  up from million from the same period in the prior year 
the loss for the year was primarily due to an increase in amortization and impairment of loan servicing rights  a compression of the interest rate spread  costs associated with a computer conversion  an increased provision for losses on real estate owned  and compensation and occupancy expenses relating to new facilities opened during and these items were partially offset by an increase in noninterest income for the year  particularly the gain on sale of loans 
the interest rate compression was caused by the bank s assets repricing downward or prepaying faster than the bank s liabilities repriced or matured 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  a decrease of from million for the same period in these results were primarily due to declining yields on interest earning assets from to in the year ended december  decreases in average earning assets compared to the same period in the prior year also contributed to the decline in interest income 
the decline in the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to general declines in the level of interest rates from to an increase in the level of nonperforming loans during also contributed to the decrease in interest income 
interest expense 
total interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year interest expense for the year ending december  decreased generally due to a lower average balance of interest bearing liabilities outstanding and a lower cost of funds as opposed to the prior year 
the average balance of interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year average borrowings decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year metropolitan s cost of funds decreased to for the year as compared to for the year in the year ended december   a lower cost was experienced on both deposits and borrowings compared to net interest margin 
our net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in while interest rates in general and especially short term interest rates were lower in than in  net interest margin was negatively impacted because yields on assets fell more quickly than costs of interest bearing liabilities 
the greater impact on asset yields was due to the falling interest rates and the options that borrowers have to prepay loans 
as rates decline  most borrowers have the option to prepay loans but the bank does not have the option to call high cost certificates of deposit 
the net interest margin was also negatively impacted by a conscious decision by management to lengthen the average remaining term of borrowings and certificates of deposit during and in order to reduce metropolitan bank s interest rate risk 
average balances and yields 
the following tables present the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
net interest margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
all average balances are daily average balances 
assets that earn interest free of federal income taxes are included at their tax equivalent yield 
nonaccruing loans are considered in average loan balances

the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in management increased the provision for loan losses during as compared to based on a problem noted with a specific group of borrowers who are related to each other 
as a result  the allowance for losses on loans at december  was million or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans at december  noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year gain on sale of loans was million for the year ended december   as compared to million during the same period in the primary reason for the increase in the year compared with the same period in was a decrease in interest rates in which caused an increase in refinance activity resulting in increased origination volumes and  therefore  an increase in loans available to sell 
the proceeds from sales of residential loans held for sale in the year were million as compared to million in the same period in proceeds from the sale of multifamily and commercial real estate loans were million for the year as compared to million for the same period in gains on sale of securities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year the gains in the year were primarily the result of the sales of loans originated  securitized  and sold by metropolitan to freddiemac 
the gains in the year were the result of the sale of fanniemae securities which were part of the multifamily securitization and freddiemac securities comprised of residential loans 
the higher level of gains in was due primarily to a higher volume of single family loans that were originated  securitized and sold in compared to there were losses from net loan servicing of million in the year ended december  as compared to income of million for the year the primary reason for the decreased income was the increased amortization of servicing rights due to an increase in paid off loans in compared to the prior year 
in addition  metropolitan recorded an allowance of million for loss due to impairment in compared to none in changes in the level of income from loan servicing rights vary directly with interest rates 
therefore  a significant increase in interest rates in over levels would likely increase the level of income from loan servicing rights 
the portfolio of loans serviced for others increased to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  origination of loan servicing partially offset payoffs and the amortization of existing loans serviced 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the reasons for the increases were the overall growth in the number of checking accounts and increases in deposit fees in as compared to prior year periods 
other noninterest income increased to million for the year compared to million for the same period in the previous year 
these increases were primarily due to increased trust fee income  increased rental income from the new corporate headquarters building  and the operations of our title insurance agency for a full year in as compared to three months in noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased to million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to million for the year personnel related expenses increased million in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these increases were primarily a result of increased staffing levels to support expanded activities such as new retail sales offices locations  new mortgage origination offices and temporary employees used to transition to a new computer system 
in addition  we operated our title insurance agency for a full year in as compared to three months in occupancy costs increased million in the twelve month period ended december   over the same period in this increase was generally the result of occupancy costs for the new corporate headquarters  three additional retail sales offices and six residential mortgage origination offices 
management does not plan to open any new retail sales offices or mortgage origination offices during this should result in a stabilization of personnel and occupancy costs as contrasted with the growth of these costs over the past five years 
data processing expense increased  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the primary reason for the increase was greater costs incurred for data processing following the systems conversion in september  marketing expense decreased  in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily due to management s efforts to reduce costs in state franchise taxes decreased  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the primary reason for the decrease were a refinement of the allocation of income among the various states where we have loans and the impact of debt at the holding company on the franchise tax calculation 
real estate owned expense was million up from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a provision for loss on the sale of two commercial real estate properties 
while these properties had been valued at fair value based on appraisals  a lack of qualified buyers over an extended period of time caused metropolitan bank to reassess the fair values resulting in the provision 
other operating expenses  which include miscellaneous general and administrative costs such as loan servicing  loan processing costs  business development  check processing  atm expenses  and professional expenses  increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in these increases were generally the result of increases in expenses pertaining to professional services  and increased business activities 
in addition  we operated our title insurance agency for a full year in as compared to three months in provision benefit for income taxes 
income taxes were a benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to an expense of  in the prior year period 
the primary reason for the change was the net loss recorded for the year comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income decreased from net income of net income for was million  or per common share  and net income for was million  or per common share 
this decrease in net income from was due primarily to a decrease in our interest rate spread due to rising interest rates during and higher operational costs due to growth in the retail sales office system  the relocation of the corporate headquarters  and investments in technology 
total assets grew to billion at december  from billion at december  compared to and prior years  asset growth slowed in due to the rising interest rate environment 
interest income 
total interest income increased to million for from million for this increase was due to a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and an increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets  particularly loans 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased to million for from million for interest expense increased primarily because the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased from the prior year and an increased cost of funds 
we increased our average balance of interest bearing liabilities in order to fund our growth of interest earning assets 
the average balance of borrowings increased from the previous year 
due to an increase in market rates paid to deposit customers and the increased use of borrowings  the cost of funds increased to in from in provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses increased  to million in from million in management increased the provision due to the ongoing analysis of the appropriate allowance for loan losses as the bank continues to grow and increases its amount of loans  and not as a response to any material change in the level of nonperforming loans 
total loans  including loans held for sale  increased to billion at december  from billion at the same date a year earlier 
the allowance for losses on loans at december  was million  or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans  at the same date in management bases its estimate of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans on an analysis of various factors 
these factors include historical loan loss experience  the status of impaired loans  economic conditions affecting real estate markets and regulatory considerations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased to million in from million in this increase occurred primarily because of the increase in our gain on sale of loans and gain on sale of securities 
net gain on sale of loans increased to million in compared to million in the primary reason for the increase in was the stabilization of interest rates  particularly in the second half of the year in compared to in addition  we added two loan origination offices which added to the volume of loans available for sale 
the proceeds of residential loan sales in was million compared to million in net loan servicing income decreased to million in from million in the portfolio of loans serviced increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  purchases of loan servicing rights and origination of loan servicing  including the securitization of our loans  were offset by payoffs and greater amortization of existing loans serviced 
in  we sold servicing rights for approximately million of loans in the fourth quarter  and recognized a gain of  service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from million in the primary reasons for the increase were the overall growth in the number of checking accounts and increases in deposit account prices in during  we sold million of mortgage backed securities available for sale for a net gain of  we purchase or sell securities and mortgage backed securities for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include the management of liquidity  interest rate risk  capital levels  collateral levels for borrowings  and to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
gains or losses from the sale of securities are incidental to the sale of those securities for the reasons listed above 
other operating income increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of a writedown of  of the bank s investment in a limited partnership that services residential real estate loans due to a permanent decline in the value of the investment 
the increase was also due to increased fee income from the increased level of business and increased rental income during noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in this increase in expenses resulted primarily from increased staffing requirements due to greater business volume and greater occupancy expenses 
personnel related expenses increased to million in from million in these increases were a result of increased staffing levels to support new retail sales offices  new mortgage origination offices  and increased business levels 
occupancy and equipment expense increased to million in from million in this increase was generally the result of opening three retail sales offices and two additional mortgage origination offices opened in along with  spent on our move to our new corporate headquarters 
federal deposit insurance premiums increased to million in compared to thousand in the reason for the increase was the increase in the bank s premium rate charged by the federal deposit insurance corp 
marketing expense increased to million for from  for this increase was the result of the promotion of brand awareness primarily through radio advertising in current and new markets and attracting new deposit customers 
state franchise taxes increased to million for as compared to  in the primary reason for the increase is the greater amount of capital at the bank  which is the basis for the tax 
data processing expense increased to million for the year as compared to million in this increase was the result of expenses incurred for electronic banking which is scheduled to begin in and overall increases in data processing costs related to a systems conversion which took place in september   and for additional retail sales offices and an increase in the number of customer accounts 
other operating expenses  which includes miscellaneous general and administrative costs such as loan servicing  business development  check processing and atm expenses  increased to million for from million for generally  these increases were due to expenses pertaining to increased business activities and increased costs for professional services 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased to  in from million in due to the decrease in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for asset quality we undertake detailed reviews of the loan portfolio regularly to identify potential problem loans or trends early and to provide for adequate estimates of probable losses 
in performing these reviews  management considers  among other things  current economic conditions  portfolio characteristics  delinquency trends  and historical loss experiences 
we normally consider loans to be nonperforming when payments are days or more past due or when the loan review analysis indicates that repossession of the collateral may be necessary to satisfy the loan 
in addition  a loan is considered impaired when  in management s opinion  it is probable that the borrower will be unable to meet the contractual terms of the loan 
when loans are classified as nonperforming  we assess the collectibility of the unpaid interest 
interest determined to be uncollectible is reversed from interest income 
future interest income is recorded only if the loan principal and interest due is considered collectible and is less than the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
the table below provides information concerning metropolitan s nonperforming assets and the allowance for losses on loans as of the dates indicated 
all loans classified by management as impaired were also classified as nonperforming 
december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans one to four family  multifamily commercial real estate    construction and land    consumer      business     total nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more  still accruing  total nonperforming loans      real estate owned      total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming loans at december  increased million to million as compared to million at december  real estate owned decreased million over the same period 
on march   based on financial projections provided by the borrowers on march   million of business loans to several entities affiliated with each other were put on nonaccrual and calculated to be impaired in the amount of million 
these loans are business loans secured by junior liens on several nursing homes and assisted living centers 
the borrowers did not make any payments on these loans during the first quarter of the estimate of the impairment was the result of comparing the book value of the loans to the present value of cash flows expected to be received based on the most likely workout scenario 
in may   the borrowers began making interest payments on these loans 
these loans were brought current as of september  through payments by the borrowers and a reduction in the rates charged on these loans 
however  due to the continuing weakness of the borrowers  these loans are still considered impaired and nonperforming at december  management determined the amount of the impairment of these loans to be million as of december  as a result of the impairment  management has recorded a specific reserve of million 
management will charge off these balances when it becomes clear that the borrowers have exhausted all possible efforts to improve the value of the underlying collateral through enhancement of the businesses operating performance or the possibility of the borrowers obtaining alternate sources of financing 
the previously discussed million of business loans that became nonperforming in the first quarter  are the primary reason for the decline of the asset quality ratios in compared to net charge offs declined to million in from million in the provision for loan losses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the increased provision for loan losses during compared to the prior year was based on increased risk of loss due to a weakening in the economy  increased nonperforming loans  and problems noted with specific borrowers 
in addition to the nonperforming assets included in the table above  we identify potential problem loans which are still performing but have a weakness which causes us to classify those loans as substandard for regulatory purposes 
there was million of loans in this category at december   compared to million of such loans at december  allowance for losses on loans 
the provision for loan losses and allowance for losses on loans is based on an analysis of individual loans  prior loss experience  growth in the loan portfolio  changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and other factors including current economic conditions 
the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period      charge offs one to four family multifamily commercial real estate consumer    business total charge offs     recoveries net charge offs     provision for loan losses      balance at end of period      net charge offs to average loans provision for loan losses to average loans allowance for losses on loans to total nonperforming loans at end of period allowance for losses on loans to total loans at end of period loans receivable decreased in to billion while the allowance for losses on loans increased to million 
management increased the allowance due to the ongoing analysis of the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
we expect to continue to increase the allowance for loan losses when necessary as the loan portfolio mix changes 
we considered the following factors in determining that this increased level of allowance for loan losses was adequate 
charge offs in remained relatively high and experienced only a slight decrease from total nonperforming loans at december  increased from a year earlier 
consumer loan charge offs remain high 
this rate was due primarily to manufactured housing loans 
we are not currently increasing our portfolio in this lending area 
substantially all recoveries detailed above are in the consumer loan category 
we separately evaluated individual nonperforming loans for the adequacy of collateral values 
we consider several of these loans to be large because they each exceed million 
while in most instances  we were able to determine that our principal balance is well secured  we have provided specific allowances in those instances where it was deemed necessary 
we reached this determination by reviewing current or updated appraisals  brokers price opinions  and other market surveys 
the impact of the economic slowdown 
after careful consideration of all of these factors  we concluded that it was necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses again in therefore  the provision for loan losses was increased to million in which resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to million 
comparison of december  and december  financial condition total assets amounted to billion at december   as compared to billion at december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in assets was concentrated in loans and was partially offset by increases in cash  securities  and premises and equipment 
under the supervisory agreement  we have committed that quarter end assets for metropolitan bank will not exceed billion during the term of the agreement 
metropolitan bank s total assets were billion at december  securities available for sale increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary reason for the increase was the purchase of million of us treasury securities during the fourth quarter of of which million remained on the books at december  loans receivable  net decreased million  or  to million at december  from billion at december  this decrease was due to loan sales  paydowns  and transfers to loans held for sale during the year 
decreases experienced in particular loan categories were million in one to four family loans  million in commercial real estate loans  million in multifamily loans  million in consumer loans 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in construction loans 
loans held for sale increased million to million at december  from million at december  the primary reasons for the increase are the large volume of residential loan originations in the second half of and transfers from loans receivable  net of million 
transfers to loans held for sale related to metropolitan bank s ongoing attempt to get to a well capitalized status and to meet certain interest rate risk goals as directed by the board of directors and required by the supervisory agreements 
loans held for sale consists of one to four family  multifamily  and commercial real estate loans 
one to four family loans are placed in this category based on the type of loan and the marketability of the loan 
in regards to multifamily and commercial loans  loans are selected for this category after reviewing current loan production and determining the impact of a potential sale on risk based capital and interest rate risk 
federal home loan bank stock decreased million to million at december  as compared to the december  balance 
the reason for the decrease was the redemption of million of stock during the second quarter 
metropolitan bank was no longer required to hold the stock due to paydowns on federal home loan bank advances  which were partially offset by dividends received on a quarterly basis 
real estate owned decreased million  or  to million at december  the primary reason for the decrease was the million provision for loss on real estate owned for the year ended december  while certain properties were priced for sale at prices consistent with subject appraisals  a lack of qualified offers over an extended period of time caused metropolitan bank to reassess their market values  resulting in the provision 
premises and equipment  net decreased million to million at december  this decrease was the result of the transfer of million of assets to premises and equipment held for sale during the fourth quarter 
the premises and equipment currently held for sale are in response to the supervisory agreement 
this transfer was partially offset by costs associated with the completion of the new headquarters 
otherwise  we do not anticipate opening any new retail locations during the next twelve months 
total deposits were billion at december   a decrease of million from the balance of billion at december  the decrease resulted principally from decreased certificates of deposit balances of million and passbook and statement savings of million  which were partially offset by an increase of million of interest bearing checking accounts 
during  the bank increased the proportion of certificates of deposit due to mature more than one year in the future in order to reduce interest rate risk 
borrowings decreased million  or  from december  to december  the decrease was the result of the paydown of federal home loan bank advances with the proceeds from asset sales and loan payoffs 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash for funding loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals  maturities of borrowings  and operating expenses 
our primary sources of internally generated funds are principal repayments and payoffs of loans  cash flows from operations  and proceeds from sales of assets 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits and borrowings  and public or private securities offerings by metropolitan 
the company s primary sources of funds currently are dividends from the bank  which are subject to restrictions imposed by federal bank regulatory agencies and debt and equity offerings 
the company s primary use of funds is for interest payments on its existing debt 
at december   the company  excluding the bank  had cash and readily convertible investments of million 
at december   the company held million in liquid assets available to pay expenses and interest 
this does not include million the company holds in liquid assets as a requirement of the subordinated notes due january  metropolitan bank s liquidity ratio average daily balance of liquid assets to average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings for the quarter ending december was 
historically  metropolitan has maintained its liquidity close to since the yield available on qualifying investments is lower than alternative uses of funds and is generally not at an attractive spread over incremental cost of funds 
at december   metropolitan bank had approximately million in cash  million in short term us treasury securities and million in fannie mae and ginnie mae mortgage backed securities which were available to sell or to pledge to meet liquidity needs 
while principal repayments and federal home loan bank advances had been fairly stable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by prevailing interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
metropolitan regularly reviews cash flow needed to fund its operations and adjusts loan and deposit rates as needed to balance cash available with cash needs 
we have access to wholesale borrowings based on the availability of eligible collateral 
the federal home loan bank makes funds available for housing finance based upon the blanket or specific pledge of certain one to four family and multifamily loans and various types of investment and mortgage backed securities 
metropolitan bank had borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank under its blanket pledge agreement of approximately million at december  metropolitan bank exceeded its borrowing capacity with an outstanding balance of million at december  to remedy this situation  metropolitan bank has pledged additional securities and has a borrowing capacity of million as of march  at december   million  or  of metropolitan s deposits were in the form of certificates of deposit of  and over 
metropolitan has also accepted out of state time deposits from individuals and entities  predominantly credit unions 
these deposits typically have balances of  to  and have a term of one year or more 
at december   approximately million  or of our deposits were held by these individuals and entities 
of these out of state time deposits  million were also included in the  and over time deposits discussed above 
during  metropolitan bank received regulatory approval and began accepting brokered deposits 
at december   brokered deposits totaled million 
the total of all certificates of deposits from brokers  out of state sources  and other certificates of deposit of  and over was million at december   or  of total deposits 
the supervisory agreement requires that the bank reduce its reliance on volatile funding sources  including but not limited to  brokered and out of state deposits 
brokered and out of state deposits have decreased from million at december  to million at december  the supervisory agreement does not call for a specific amount of reduction or a specific time frame in which to make the reduction 
since many of these depositors are not located near our retail sales offices and do not have other accounts  these deposits tend to be less stable and less likely to renew if our rates are not competitive with national rates 
our dependence on these wholesale types of deposits creates the risk that we might experience a liquidity shortage if we stopped issuing or renewing these types of certificates of deposit or that we would have to pay high rates to renew or replace these funds which would negatively impact our profitability 
in order to minimize these risks  we monitor the maturity of these types of funds so their maturities are staggered 
we also deal with several brokers and compare rates among them to be sure we are paying competitive rates 
however  based on the federal home loan bank collateral requirements  the bank may have to use brokered or out of state certificates of deposit for liquidity purposes 
if a liquidity shortage occurs  we have the ability to generate additional liquidity beyond the cash and securities mentioned above by stopping the issuance of commitments to make new loans and selling some or all of the million of loans we own that are classified as held for sale at december  such a liquidation of loans held for sale could have a negative impact on net interest income 
the financial market makes funds available through reverse repurchase agreements by accepting various investment and mortgage backed securities as collateral 
metropolitan bank had borrowings through reverse repurchase agreements of million at december  capital 
the office of thrift supervision ots imposes capital requirements on savings associations 
savings associations are required to meet three minimum capital standards i a leverage requirement  ii a tangible capital requirement  and iii a risk based capital requirement 
such standards must be no less stringent than those applicable to national banks 
in addition  the ots is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual associations on a case by case basis 
the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december  were in excess of the capital requirements specified by ots regulations as shown by the following table tangible core risk based capital capital capital dollars in thousands capital amount actual    required    excess    it is metropolitan bank s goal  as well as required by metropolitan bank s supervisory agreement  to increase risk based capital to reach the well capitalized risk based capital level of by march  under the supervisory agreement  metropolitan bank submitted a revised plan for increasing capital to regulatory authorities on december  the following table summarizes metropolitan bank s status compared to the supervisory agreement requirements tangible core risk based capital capital capital dollars in thousands capital amount actual    required    excess deficiency    at december   metropolitan bank s risk based capital was million less than the requirement for a well capitalized institution 
pursuant to the rights offering and concurrent offering to the public  the company could raise million 
if such amount is raised  approximately million will be contributed to metropolitan bank 
therefore  the rights offering and the concurrent offering to the public  if successful  will satisfy the capital requirements of the supervisory agreements 
if the company raises at least million in capital  metropolitan bank could reach well capitalized status by achieving its forecasts for reducing the level of risk based assets  breaking even on its results of operations and having no further impairment of servicing rights 
however  if the company is not successful in completing the offerings  management s plan to reach the risk based capital level may  subject to negotiations with regulators  include stopping the issuance of new loan commitments and selling selected assets  including some or all of the million of loans classified as held for sale at december  and the million of fixed assets held for sale 
recent accounting developments a new accounting standard requires all business combinations to be recorded using the purchase method of accounting for any transaction initiated after june  under the purchase method  all identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired company must be recorded at fair value at date of acquisition  and the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets must be separated from goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives will be amortized under the new standard  whereas goodwill  both amounts previously recorded and future amounts purchased  will cease being amortized starting in annual impairment testing will be required for goodwill with impairment being recorded if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
adoption of this standard on january  will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation and in monetary and fiscal policies 
our ability to match the interest rate sensitivity of our financial assets to the interest sensitivity of our financial liabilities in our asset liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on our financial performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metropolitan  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk that a company can suffer economic loss due to changes in the market values of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  we make a profit by accepting and managing various types of risks 
the most significant of these risks are credit risk and interest rate risk 
see asset quality for a comprehensive discussion of credit risk 
the principal market risk for us is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will cause significant changes in net interest income because interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
the office of thrift supervision currently looks to thrift bulletin a  issued december   to evaluate interest rate risk at institutions they supervise 
they categorize interest rate risk as minimal  moderate  significant  or high based on a combination of the projected net portfolio value npv level after a basis point change in interest rates and the size of that change in npv due to a basis point change in interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk in a number of ways 
some of the tools used to monitor and quantify interest rate risk include annual budgeting process  quarterly forecasting process  quarterly shock report of effect of sudden interest rate changes on net interest income  quarterly shock report of effect of sudden interest rate changes on net value of portfolio equity  monthly review of listing of liability rates and maturities by month  monthly analysis of rate and volume changes in historic net interest income  weekly review of certificate of deposit offering rates and maturities by day  and weekly forecast of cash flows and balance sheet activity 
we have established an asset and liability committee to monitor interest rate risk 
this committee is made up of senior officers from finance  lending and deposit operations 
the committee meets twice a month  reviews our current interest rate risk position  and determines strategies to pursue for the next month 
the activities of this committee are reported to the board of directors of the bank monthly 
between meetings the members of this committee are involved in setting rates on deposits  setting rates on loans and serving on loan committees where they work on implementing the established strategies 
during and  like many financial institutions  we had exposure to potential declines in net interest income from rising interest rates 
this is because metropolitan has had more short term interest rate sensitive liabilities than short term interest rate sensitive assets 
one of the ways we monitor interest rate risk quantitatively is to measure the potential change in net interest income based on various immediate changes in market interest rates 
the following table shows the expected change in net interest income for immediate sustained parallel shifts of and in market interest rates as of the end of the last two years 
the results for a downward parallel shift of at december  are not meaningful because some rates such as federal funds are already less than 
expected change in net interest income change in interest rate december  december  n a the change in net interest income from a change in market rates is a short term measure of interest rate risk 
the results above indicate that we have some short term exposure to rising rates and that the exposure has decreased significantly over the past year 
during  interest rates declined and the projection of the change in net interest income as of december  indicated a benefit from declining rates 
however  the company actually experienced a decline in net interest income during as a result of declining rates 
this was because the model assumed an immediate parallel shift in rates while the actual change took place over a number of months and was concentrated in maturities less than two years 
another quantitative measure of interest rate risk is the change in the market value of all financial assets and liabilities based on various immediate sustained shifts in market interest rates 
this concept is also known as net portfolio value and is the methodology used by the office of thrift supervision in measuring interest rate risk 
the following table shows the expected change in net portfolio value for immediate sustained parallel shifts of and in market interest rates as of the end of the last two years 
expected change in net portfolio value change in interest rate december  december  the change in net portfolio value is a long term measure of interest rate risk 
it assumes that no significant changes in assets or liabilities held would take place if there were a sudden change in interest rates 
because we monitor interest rate risk regularly and actively manage that risk  these projections serve as an expected worst case scenario assuming no reaction to changing rates 
the results above indicate that the post shock npv has declined significantly during under tb a  metropolitan falls in the minimal interest rate risk category as of december   based upon current sensitivity to interest rate changes and the current level of regulatory capital 
our strategies to limit interest rate risk from rising interest rates are as follows originate fixed rate one to four family loans primarily for sale  originate the majority of business loans to float with prime rates  increase core deposits which have low interest rate sensitivity  borrow funds with maturities matched to new long term assets acquired  maintain the volume of loans serviced since the value of that asset rises as rates rise  and consider the use of derivatives to reduce interest rate risk when economically practical 
we also follow strategies that increase interest rate risk in limited ways including originating and purchasing fixed rate multifamily and commercial real estate loans limited to five year maturities  and originating and purchasing fixed rate consumer loans with terms from two to fifteen years 
the result of these strategies taken together is that metropolitan has reduced long term interest rate risk by extending the maturities of borrowings and certificates of deposit due in more than one year during the bank s level of interest rate risk as of december   is within the limits set by the bank s board of directors 
management does not anticipate efforts to reduce interest rate risk further in we are also aware that any method of measuring interest rate risk including the two used above has certain shortcomings 
for example  certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing dates but their repricing rates may not follow the general trend in market interest rates 
also  as a result of competition  the interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while rates on other assets and liabilities may lag market rates 
in addition  any projection of a change in market rates requires that prepayment rates on loans and early withdrawal of certificates of deposits be projected and those projections may be inaccurate 
finally  as we experienced in  when rates change the shape and slope of the yield curve often change although our projection model assumes that rates change uniformly throughout the yield curve 
we focus on the change in net interest income and the change in net portfolio value as a result of immediate and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates as a balanced approach to monitoring interest rate risk when used with budgeting and the other tools noted above 
at the present time we do not hold any trading positions  foreign currency positions  or commodity positions 
equity investments are approximately of assets and of that amount is held in federal home loan bank stock which can be sold to the federal home loan bank of cincinnati at par 
therefore  we do not consider any of these areas to be a source of significant market risk
