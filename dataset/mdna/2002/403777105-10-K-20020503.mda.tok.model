item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and there can be no assurance that gymboree s actual future performance will meet such expectations 
factors that could cause future performance to vary from current expectations include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed in item  business and in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to inventory valuation  asset impairment and income taxes 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we estimate shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
asset impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
income taxes 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings

these increases more than offset the loss of sales associated with the exclusion of the rd week  the loss of sales from non zutopia stores closed during  and the sale closure of zutopia on march  resulting in sales of only million in fiscal versus million in fiscal management believes the increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improvements in the overall product offering and inventory levels that supported increases in both average transaction values and overall transactions processed over the prior year 
the number of stores open at the end of the period was  compared to open at the end of fiscal year which included zutopia stores 
the reduction in overall store count reflects the sale of and closure of zutopia stores

play music income  net play music income  net  increased to million for the fifty two weeks ended february  from million for the fifty three weeks ended february  the increase was primarily due to increases in domestic franchise activity  royalties from existing franchises  and improved performance related to the company s owned locations  which more than offset the impact from revenue associated with the additional week in the prior year

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations gymboree has historically experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our retail sales and net income 
historically  a disproportionate amount of our retail sales and a significant portion of our net income have been realized during the months of november and december 
in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months  gymboree hires a significant number of temporary employees to bolster the store staff 
in addition  we have experienced periods of increased sales activity in early spring and early fall 
if  for any reason  our sales were below seasonal norms during november and december  or during the early spring or early fall  our annual operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
historically  retail sales and net income have been weakest during the second fiscal quarter  and we expect this trend to continue 
gymboree s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the costs and increased overhead associated with the opening and future operation of new stores 
in addition  the sales contributed by new stores  advertising and marketing expenditures  merchandise mix and timing  and level of markdowns may contribute to fluctuations in operating performance
