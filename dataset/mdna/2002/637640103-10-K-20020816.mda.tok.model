item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements contained in the outlook section and within certain sections of management s discussion and analysis are forward looking based on our current expectations and management s estimates and actual results may differ materially 
the forward looking statements reference a number of risks and uncertainties 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the general economy  the changing environment of the semiconductor industry  competitive products and pricing  growth in the wireless  pc and communications infrastructure industries  regulatory and international conditions  the effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  and other risks and uncertainties that we may detail from time to time in our reports and filings with the sec 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto o critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
we record at the time of shipment a provision for estimated future returns 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales are sold through distributors 
we have agreements with our distributors for various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resales  scrap allowances and volume incentives 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends and other related factors 
to date the actual distributor activity has been consistent with the provisions we made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
intellectual property income is not classified as revenue 
this income is classified as non operating income and is recognized when the license is delivered and no further obligations to the other party exist 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount that is the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our products are classified as either custom  which are those products manufactured with customer specified features or characteristics  or non custom  which are those products that do not have customer specified features or characteristics 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write down inventory below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions regarding future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us the ability to make reliable estimates 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are based on the difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is determined as the selling price of the product less estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or the net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets subject to this evaluation include acquired patented and unpatented technology 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of those factors we consider include o significant decrease in the market value of an asset o significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition o a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset o significant negative change in the business climate  industry or economic conditions o current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset in view of the recent general economic decline  we are periodically evaluating whether an impairment of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets has occurred 
our evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  if and when the impairment is recorded 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
we performed a goodwill impairment review upon initial adoption of the new accounting rules for goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal we also performed an annual review for goodwill impairment in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our impairment review is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units with goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units with goodwill 
we use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model for each business unit with goodwill 
reporting units with goodwill include our wireless  displays and power business units that are operating segments within our analog reportable segment and our wired communications group that is reported within other operating segments 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or market conditions for these businesses fail to improve  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
o overview we recorded net sales of billion in fiscal this compares to billion in both fiscal and fiscal the decline in sales for fiscal came from lower demand seen broadly across semiconductor markets  as business conditions in the semiconductor industry remained weak throughout the fiscal year 
in contrast  market conditions were very strong in the first half of fiscal as we entered into the second half of fiscal  market conditions for the semiconductor industry quickly weakened 
as a result  we experienced growth in sales for the first half of fiscal over sales for the first half of fiscal this was essentially offset by a sharp decline in sales for the second half of fiscal  resulting in year over year flat sales 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
this compares to net income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our operating results for fiscal have been primarily affected by lower sales as a result of slower demand from the overall economic slowdown 
the net loss for fiscal included million of special items 
the special items included million for in process r d charges related to the acquisitions of fincitec oy  arsmikro ou and wireless solutions sweden ab see note 
special items also included a net charge of million related to cost reduction actions see note 
net income for fiscal included special items of million  including million for in process r d charges related to acquisitions during the year see note and a million net charge for cost reduction actions see note 
for fiscal  net income included special items of million 
special items in fiscal included a million gain from the sale of assets of the cyrix pc microprocessor business see note and a million in process r d charge related to an acquisition see note 
special items also included credits of million related to restructuring of operations see note and million related to an indemnity agreement with fairchild semiconductor that expired in march see note 
in addition to these special items  fiscal net income included a million gain from our sale of shares of fairchild stock and an extraordinary loss of million net of taxes of million 
we sold the shares of fairchild stock as part of an initial public offering and a secondary offering that fairchild completed during the year 
we recorded the extraordinary loss in connection with the early redemption of our percent convertible subordinated notes due o sales the following discussion is based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our sales for fiscal declined significantly year on year  as market conditions for the semiconductor industry remained weak compared to fiscal although we saw a slight increase in unit volume in the second half of fiscal  the sales decline for the year was primarily due to a decreased volume of shipments 
lower average selling prices were also a factor  as we saw a shift in product mix toward lower priced products and took some pricing actions under programs to gain increased market share in target areas 
the analog segment  which represents percent of our total sales  experienced a decline in sales of percent for fiscal from sales for fiscal the decline in fiscal was due to a drop in unit volume together with decreases in average selling prices 
average selling prices were down due to shifts in product mix as well as some decline in prices  particularly on multisource products  which tend to be viewed as commodity products 
within the analog segment  sales of application specific wireless products  including radio frequency building blocks  declined in fiscal by percent from sales in fiscal in the broad based analog markets  sales of power management and amplifier products were also down in fiscal from sales in fiscal by percent and percent  respectively 
only sales of display products increased in fiscal those sales increased by percent over sales in fiscal  as a large increase in unit volume more than offset decreases in average selling prices 
sales for fiscal for the information appliances segment declined percent from sales for fiscal the decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume  as average selling prices increased slightly 
since a large part of our portfolio of information appliance products is still consumed in the pc marketplace  the year to year slowdown in demand for personal computers and pc related products had a significant effect in the decline in sales for the information appliance segment 
in addition  the market adoption of emerging information appliances that are not pcs has been slower than expected 
for fiscal  sales declined in all geographic regions compared to sales for fiscal the decreases were percent in the americas  percent in europe  percent in japan and percent in the asia pacific region 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region  while decreasing to percent in the americas and percent in europe 
sales as a percentage of total sales held at percent in japan 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all weakened against the dollar  but the impact from this was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales for fiscal was denominated in foreign currency 
sales overall for fiscal were flat compared to sales for fiscal for the first half of fiscal  we experienced growing sales as a result of higher volumes while average selling prices were relatively flat 
our sales declined significantly in the second half of fiscal  as market conditions for the semiconductor industry quickly weakened 
the decline was shown in reduced shipments  as average selling prices remained relatively the same 
fiscal sales for the analog segment were flat compared to sales in fiscal sales of analog products led the growth in sales for the first half of fiscal with an increase of percent over sales for the comparable first half of fiscal this growth was attributable to higher unit volume combined with slightly higher average selling prices 
a significant decline in sales for analog products in the second half of fiscal essentially offset the growth experienced in the first half of the fiscal year 
analog product sales in the second half of fiscal declined percent compared to sales in the comparable second half of fiscal  mainly due to a sharp drop in unit volume while average selling prices remained fairly stable 
sales of application specific wireless products  including radio frequency building blocks  grew percent in fiscal over fiscal this was driven by sales growth of percent in the first half of fiscal over the comparable first half of fiscal followed by a decline of percent in sales for the second half of fiscal sales of amplifiers  interface and power management products also grew in fiscal by percent  percent and percent  respectively  over sales in fiscal this was driven by sales growth in the first half of fiscal of percent  percent and percent  respectively  over the comparable first half of fiscal declines in the second half of the fiscal year of percent  percent and percent  respectively  from the comparable second half of fiscal  partially offset the growth in the first half of the fiscal year 
sales in fiscal for the information appliance segment declined by percent from sales in fiscal due to decreases in both unit shipments and average selling prices 
while the information appliance segment experienced an percent growth in sales for the first half of fiscal over the comparable first half of fiscal  it was more than offset by a percent decline in sales for the second half of fiscal from the comparable second half of fiscal the slowdown in demand for personal computers and pc related products contributed to the decline in sales for the information appliance segment since a large part of the portfolio of information appliance products is still consumed in the pc marketplace 
the slower than expected adoption of emerging information appliances that are not pcs also had a negative impact on growth 
the fiscal comparison excludes sales from the cyrix pc microprocessor unit  which we sold in september compared to sales in fiscal  fiscal sales increased in japan by percent and in the asia pacific region by percent  while sales decreased in the americas by percent and in europe by percent 
as the japanese yen and most european currencies weakened against the dollar  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation had an unfavorable impact on foreign currency denominated sales for fiscal however  this impact was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales was denominated in foreign currency 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent in the asia pacific region and percent in japan  while declining to percent in the americas and remaining flat at percent in europe 
o gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the erosion in gross margin was primarily driven by lower factory utilization 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal ran at percent  as production activity was reduced considerably by the weakened business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
this compares with wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal of percent when business conditions in the semiconductor industry were much stronger  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 
we also saw lower margins from some products in fiscal  caused mostly from a shift in product sales mix and to a lesser extent from pricing pressure  which also impacted the lower gross margin 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal was primarily driven by improved product mix  as we shipped more high contribution analog and wireless products  combined with improved manufacturing efficiency and higher factory utilization during the first half of fiscal wafer fabrication capacity utilization in the first half of fiscal ran at percent  but dropped to percent in the second half of the fiscal year when business conditions in the semiconductor industry quickly deteriorated and production activity was significantly reduced 
for the year as a whole  wafer fabrication capacity utilization was percent compared to percent in fiscal o research and development research and development expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to acquisitions see note 
the in process r d charges are included in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of special items 
higher r d expenses for fiscal result mainly from a license agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
the agreement  which began in fiscal  allows us to gain access to a variety of tsmc s advanced sub micron processes for use in our maine facility as desired  if and when those processes are developed by tsmc 
these advanced process technologies are expected to accelerate the development of high performance digital and mixed signal products in the markets for wireless handsets  displays  information appliances and information infrastructure 
during fiscal  we devoted approximately percent of our r d effort towards new product development and percent towards the development of process and support technology 
compared to fiscal  this represents a percent decrease in spending for new product development and a percent increase towards the development of process and support technology 
while spending for new product development declined slightly  we continue to focus our r d investment on our key strategic programs 
we continue to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the wireless handsets  displays  information appliances and information infrastructure markets 
we also continue to devote resources towards developing new cores and integrating those cores with other technological capabilities to create system on a chip solutions 
the increase in r d expenses for fiscal reflected increased investment in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the wireless handsets  displays  information appliances and information infrastructure markets  as well as in the process technologies needed to support these products 
o selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
the fiscal sg a expenses included a million expense associated with the charitable donation of equity securities that were part of our investment portfolio 
we donated the securities to establish the national semiconductor foundation 
the fiscal sg a expenses also included goodwill amortization of million 
we no longer record goodwill amortization since adopting new accounting rules beginning in fiscal excluding these expenses  sg a expenses for fiscal declined percent from sg a expenses for fiscal overall the decline in fiscal expenses reflects actions that we implemented in the second half of fiscal to reduce our spending in response to weakened business conditions  combined with our efforts to further control spending as business conditions remained weak throughout fiscal these actions reduced payroll and employee benefit expenses  as well as discretionary selling and marketing program expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the million donation expense that we recorded in fiscal excluding that expense  sg a expenses in fiscal actually declined by two percent from sg a expenses in fiscal actions that we implemented to reduce spending in the second half of fiscal in response to weakened business conditions contributed to the decline in these expenses for fiscal the effect of those cost reduction actions was largely offset by higher pay rates in fiscal over fiscal o cost reduction programs and restructuring of operations for fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for cost reduction actions associated with the plan we announced in may to reposition our resources 
this charge was partially offset by a credit of million of remaining reserves that were no longer needed for previously announced actions because the activities were completed in fiscal at a lower cost than originally estimated 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these charges  as well as other activity during fiscal related to previously announced actions 
o charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal of the combined companies of fincitec oy and arsmikro ou  and separately of wireless solutions sweden ab  million and million of the total purchase price for each acquisition were respectively allocated to the value of in process r d 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal of vivid semiconductor and innocomm wireless  million and million of the total purchase price for each acquisition were respectively allocated to the value of in process r d 
in connection with the acquisition of algorex in fiscal  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d 
these amounts were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative uses existed for the technologies 
fincitec oy and arsmikro ou develop low voltage  low power application specific integrated circuits for battery powered devices 
the acquisition is expected to strengthen our development capabilities for power management circuits for the portable market 
it should help us expand our suite of integrated and discrete silicon solutions for handheld devices  including cell phones  personal digital assistants  digital cameras and similar electronic devices 
wireless solutions sweden ab is a developer of wireless solutions ranging from telemetry to mobile phones to wireless networking  including bluetooth 
this acquisition should help us to deliver complete wireless reference designs  including silicon chipsets  hardware and software 
innocomm is a developer of chipsets for wireless networking applications 
its expertise in short range wireless technologies such as bluetooth and homerf is intended to complement our existing base of design and product expertise 
we intend to use vivid s technologies and analog engineering resources to increase our strength in creating silicon solutions for the flat panel display market 
algorex is a provider of high performance digital signal processing products  architecture and software technologies for the wireless communication markets and these technologies should enhance our future capability to provide complete chipset solutions for the cellular phone and wireless information appliance markets 
for each acquisition  the fair value of the in process r d was based on discounted projected net cash flows expected to be derived after successful completion of the existing r d projects 
estimates of future cash flows from revenues were based primarily on market growth assumptions  lives of underlying technologies and our expected share of market 
gross profit projections were based on our experience with products that were similar in nature or products sold into markets with similar characteristics 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges were deducted from gross profit to determine net operating income for the in process r d projects 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included sales and marketing expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it has achieved technological feasibility 
we discounted the net cash flows of the in process r d projects using probable adjusted discount rates that approximated the overall rate of return for each acquisition as a whole and reflected the inherent uncertainties surrounding the development of in process r d projects 
o interest income and interest expense for fiscal  we earned net interest income of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal offsetting interest expense was slightly lower for fiscal as we continued to reduce our outstanding debt balances 
the increase in net interest income for fiscal over fiscal was due to both higher average cash balances and slightly higher interest rates in fiscal than in fiscal in addition  interest expense in fiscal was significantly lower than in fiscal due to lower debt  since we repaid our million convertible subordinated notes in november o other income  net other income  net was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the components of other income  net for fiscal included million of net intellectual property income  a million net gain from equity investments and million from other miscellaneous losses 
net intellectual property income for fiscal included a gain of million from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 
the remaining intellectual property income was from a number of individually small agreements 
beginning in fiscal  equity in losses of investments accounted for under the equity method was included in net gain from equity investments 
other income  net for fiscal and has been re characterized to conform with this classification 
other income  net for fiscal included a net gain from equity investments of million and net intellectual property income of million 
the net gain from equity investments for fiscal included a gain of million from the distribution of equity securities that were part of our investment portfolio  which we donated to establish the national semiconductor foundation 
an expense for the same amount associated with the donation was included in sg a expenses for fiscal net intellectual property income for fiscal included million from a single significant licensing agreement with a korean company and the remainder from a number of individually small agreements 
other income  net for included a net gain from equity investments of million  million of net intellectual property income and other miscellaneous income of million 
net intellectual property income for fiscal related primarily to two significant licensing agreements 
o income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit represented an expected refund of us taxes as a result of the new federal tax act  which was partially offset by taxes due on international income 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was one percent compared to effective tax rates of percent for fiscal and two percent for fiscal our ability to realize net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted us taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these tax assets 
however  it is always possible that we will not be able to meet our expectations of future us taxable income 
o foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
o financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio  a series of severe cuts in interest rates  such as those recently experienced  does have a significant impact on the amount of interest income we can earn from our cash portfolio 
an increase in interest rates benefits us due to our large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates would not necessarily increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of our existing debt obligations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of may  o liquidity and capital resources as of may   cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million  slightly down from million at may  cash and cash equivalents decreased million in fiscal compared to increases of million in fiscal and million in fiscal we describe the primary factors contributing to these changes below we generated cash from operating activities of million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we generated cash from operating activities in fiscal because the noncash components of our net loss  primarily depreciation and amortization  were greater than the reported net loss and the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities more than offset the positive effect to working capital from a decrease in inventories 
for fiscal  operating cash was generated primarily from net income adjusted for noncash expenses  which was partially offset by a negative impact from changes in working capital components 
the negative impact from changes in working capital components was softened as the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were substantially offset by the positive effect to working capital from a decrease in receivables 
for fiscal  net income adjusted for noncash items was negatively affected by changes in working capital components primarily due to increases in receivables and inventories 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to million used in fiscal in fiscal our investing activities generated cash of million 
major uses of cash in fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and the acquisitions of fincitec oy  arsmikro ou and wireless solutions sweden ab for a total of million  net of cash acquired see note 
major uses of cash in fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million and the acquisitions of innocomm and vivid for a total of million  net of cash acquired see note 
in contrast  proceeds of million  primarily from the sale of fairchild semiconductor stock  and million from the sale of the cyrix pc microprocessor business were the main contributors to cash generated from our investing activities in fiscal this was partially offset by our investment in property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal our financing activities generated cash of million for fiscal  while they used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary source of cash was from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans in the amount of million in fiscal  which was partially offset by repayment of million of our outstanding debt balances 
the primary use of cash in fiscal was for our repurchase of million shares of common stock on the open market for million 
all of these shares were retired during fiscal this more than offset cash inflow of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
for fiscal the primary use of cash was for the payment of million to redeem our percent convertible subordinated notes 
other debt repayment of million was offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefits plans during fiscal management foresees substantial cash outlays for plant and equipment throughout fiscal  with primary focus on new capabilities that support our target growth markets  as well as improvements to provide more capacity in selected areas and also better manufacturing efficiency and productivity 
based on current economic conditions  the fiscal capital expenditure level is expected to be higher than the fiscal level 
however  we will continue to manage capital expenditures consistent with ongoing business conditions 
we expect existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  to be sufficient to finance capital investments planned for fiscal our cash and investment balances are dependent on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  continued and significant declines in overall economic conditions would probably impact sales and may lead to problems with customer receivables 
in addition  major declines in financial markets would probably cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments 
the following table provides a summary of the effect on liquidity and cash flows from our contractual obligations as of may  in millions fiscal year and thereafter total contractual obligations debt obligations noncancellable operating leases fairchild manufacturing agreement licensing agreements tsmc other total commercial commitments standby letters of credit under bank multicurrency agreement o recently issued accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements as described in note to the consolidated financial state at the beginning of fiscal the impact of adoption of this statement is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   and eliminates the use of the pooling of interests method 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal and applied its provisions to acquisitions closed after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are currently analyzing this statement and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal year in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although sfas no 
retains the basic requirements of sfas no 
regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss  it provides additional implementation guidance 
sfas no 
also supersedes the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations  pertaining to discontinued operations 
separate reporting of a discontinued operation is still required  but sfas no 
expands the presentation to include a component of an entity  rather than strictly a business segment 
we are currently analyzing this statement and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal year in april  the financial accounting standard board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
   amendment of fasb no 
 and technical corrections 
among other provisions  sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria of apb no 
gains or losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of apb no 
should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all prior periods presented 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
o outlook rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
substantial capital and r d investment are also required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of these industry conditions  we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
although semiconductor market conditions for fiscal continued to be weak compared to that in fiscal  we experienced sequential quarterly growth in new orders in each of our fiscal quarters 
the sequential improvement was driven by new orders for our products that are aimed at wireless handsets  displays  notebook computers and other electronic devices 
our week backlog as we entered the first quarter of fiscal was greater than it was at the beginning of the previous quarter 
this was driven by a strong pattern of new orders we saw in the second half of fiscal as order levels have improved  the aging of orders has become more normalized as our customers place more orders further out in time 
consequently  this affects the amount they place in turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter 
based on expectations of turns orders for the quarter  our outlook is for first quarter fiscal sales to be around the same level as in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when we reported sales of million 
historically  sales in our first quarter have usually been flat or down from the preceding fourth quarter 
weekly orders in july compared to june have improved  but the expected level of sales for the fiscal first quarter remains dependent on receiving the anticipated turns orders in the remaining august period 
we also expect our gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal to be comparabale with the fourth quarter of fiscal overall  we expect to remain profitable for the first quarter of fiscal in may  we announced a plan to reposition our resources  including a shift of more sales and marketing resources to the asia pacific region to support growing opportunities in that region as sales in the region grew to percent of total sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal if we are unsuccessful in growing those market opportunities or if the economic environment in the region declines  our future sales may be unfavorably affected 
our focus is to continue to introduce new products  particularly more highly integrated system on a chip products and higher margin analog products that are targeted towards wireless handsets  displays  information appliances and information infrastructure 
if the development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future gross margin may be unfavorably affected 
the wireless handset market continues to be important to our future growth plans 
new integrated chipsets are being developed to provide added dollar content in targeted entry level handsets 
new products are also being developed to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as color displays and image capture 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in this targeted market 
although the number of wireless handsets sold worldwide is a large market  near term growth trends are highly uncertain and difficult to predict with accuracy 
delayed introduction of next generation wireless base stations also negatively impacts potential growth in the wireless handset market 
there is also uncertainty related to the standards that ultimately will be adopted for the next generation wireless base stations 
as a result  we remain cautious on near term trends in our wireless related businesses 
we continue to hold numerous design wins for our highly integrated information appliance products  but end user adoption of the various devices that utilize our products has been slower than anticipated 
a design win is when a customer has chosen our semiconductor product and designed it into their device 
it is not yet clear which form factors  specific customers products or customers business models will ultimately be successful in this emerging market 
revenue for our information appliance products is dependent on the outcome and the timing of product acceptance trends 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development and market acceptance of new products  is a key factor to our successful growth and our ability to achieve strong financial performance 
our product portfolio generally has short product life cycles 
successful development and introduction of new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we will continue to invest resources to develop new cores and integrate those cores with our other capabilities to create system on a chip products that leverage our leading edge analog and mixed signal technology 
we will also continue to prioritize our investments by focusing on applications in the wireless handsets  displays  information appliances and information infrastructure markets  as well as in process technologies needed to support those products 
given the uncertainty in the current economic climate  it is difficult to accurately predict at this time our financial performance beyond the first quarter of fiscal assuming no significant improvement in the economy  we anticipate r d spending for fiscal to be slightly higher than the fiscal level driven by increased investments in our key focus areas 
overall sg a expense is expected to be slightly higher than the fiscal level due to higher payroll and employee costs  but we will continue to align our cost structure with current business conditions 
we have made and will continue to make strategic business acquisitions or investments in order to gain access to key technologies that can augment our existing technical capability or enable us to achieve faster time to market 
these can involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate and develop acquired technologies as expected 
if the technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
with acquisition activity  there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by certain acquisition related costs  such as but not limited to  in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
because of significant international sales  we benefit overall from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect our consolidated sales and operating results 
although we attempt to manage short term exposures to foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that our risk management activities will fully offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that these governments or other government entities will not serve future notices of assessments on us  or that the amounts of such assessments and our failure to favorably resolve such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  our tax returns for certain years are under examination in the us while we believe we have sufficiently provided for all tax obligations  we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome of the tax examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
the september terrorist attacks on the us and subsequent associated events have created additional uncertainty on the state of the us economy overall 
although we did not experience any immediate direct adverse effect on our operations from the terrorist attacks  the longer term and indirect consequences from this catastrophic event are not yet known 
there can be no assurance that the economic and political climate will improve in the near future 
if the slow business conditions in the global economy continue or become more severe  our future sales and operating results will be negatively impacted
