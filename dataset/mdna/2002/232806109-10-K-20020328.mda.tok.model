overview year ended in thousands  except per share amounts december  december  january  revenue    net income loss    diluted earnings loss per share we recorded revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from fiscal record revenues of  million 
fiscal was a challenging year characterized by a fundamental slowdown in end customer demand in all the markets we serve 
the first half of fiscal was characterized by inventory reduction efforts by customers that led to order cancellations and a large drop in volume 
during the latter half of  order cancellations returned to historical average levels with a book to bill ratio of close to however order levels remained below levels and the levels that we were forecasting earlier in in addition  we saw some stabilization of customer inventories along with a continued shift by customers to the practice of placing orders for shipment in the same quarter 
this practice of turns orders reduces our visibility into future sales 
throughout the year  there was continued pressure on gross margins from further declines in average selling prices asp  under utilization of factories and large provision for inventory reserves

page results of operations revenues revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to revenues for fiscal we derive our revenues from the sale of memory products and non memory products  which are targeted primarily to the data communications and computation markets 
during fiscal  all market segments that we sold our product into were adversely impacted by the severe economic downturn that was characterized by a significant drop in end user demand and exacerbated by excess inventory in most  if not all  of the channels 
the networking markets suffered the greatest decrease in demand  followed by wireless and to a lesser extent the computing and consumer markets 
business segment net revenues in thousands memory    non memory    total consolidated revenues    revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal decreased million or versus revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the decrease in memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted from a decrease in unit demand for semiconductor products particularly in the wireless and networking markets 
in asps increased as a result of a continuing increase in the average density mbits unit of static random access memories rams products sold 
this increase was driven by new product revenues  particularly the and meg more battery life mobl family of parts and the meg and meg synchronous family of static rams 
adjusted for this mix change  asps declined by from to and by from to on a same product basis 
revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal increased million or over revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the increase in memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted from both higher asp and an increase in unit sales 
asp grew from fiscal to fiscal and unit saes increased over the same period 
the increase in unit sales in fiscal can be attributed primarily to new product revenues  particularly in the meg synchronous family  which includes the no bus latency nobl static ram  the and meg mobl and the meg micro power family of products 
the synchronous demand was driven by the surge in the networking market  while sales for mobl and other micro power devices were driven by growth in the cellular phone market 
high asps resulted from strong demand for static rams and the continuing increase in the average density mbits unit of static ram products sold 
revenues in from the sale of non memory products decreased million or when compared to revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the decrease in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from a decrease in unit sales 
the decrease in unit sales resulted from decreases in unit demand in all aspects of the networking end markets  and reduced end customer demand in the personal computer market in the first half of fiscal demand for pc related clock chips and usb related products recovered in the second half of the year 
revenues in from the sale of non memory products increased million or from the growth was predominantly unit related and can be attributed to the market acceptance of cypress s physical layer phy  data communication  clock and usb products 
key products in the portfolio include our hotlink optical transceivers  the roboclock family of clock buffers  our low skew and low jitter programmable clocks  our broad portfolio of specialty multi port memories and our plug and play usb devices 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  asp of products generally declines over the lifetime of the products 
to increase revenues  cypress seeks to expand its market share in the markets it currently serves and to introduce and sell new products with higher asp 
cypress will seek to remain competitive with respect to its pricing to prevent a further decline in sales 
page cost of revenues cost of revenue as a percent of revenues for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was caused by increased inventory reserves  under utilization in our factories and continued declines in the asp of memory  usb and clock devices 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenues decreased to in fiscal from for fiscal due to a significant increase in unit sales in  resulting in a lower fixed cost per unit sold  and to the introduction of new products with higher margins 
during the third quarter of fiscal  cypress received feedback from our customers that indicated that the downturn in sales would last longer than previously anticipated 
accordingly  we increased inventory reserves during the quarter for inventory that we did not expect to sell 
cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal included an unusual charge of million for inventory reserves  during fiscal  including the million unusual charge  total net charges for inventory reserves were million 
additional charges to cost of revenues to increase inventory reserves may be necessary in the future if demand continues to decline 
cost of revenues for fiscal were of revenues  compared to of revenues for fiscal the decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was primarily due to a significant increase in unit sales  resulting in a lower fixed cost per unit sold and to the introduction of new products with higher margins 
assembly and test factory utilization decreased from in to in wafer fabrication factory utilization did not change significantly as we built inventory in the first half of the year anticipating a shorter downturn 
when the severity and length of the downturn became clear  we restructured cypress and took capital equipment out of service and are now holding this equipment for sale 
asp  on a same device basis  decreased in compared to see business segment net revenues section above 
cypress is continuing its strong emphasis on new product development and improvements in manufacturing technologies and yields  which cypress expects will reduce manufacturing costs and help offset some of the impact of near term margin declines 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million were also written off to cost of revenues as one time charges as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal research and development year ended in thousands december  december  january  revenues    research and development    r d as percent of revenues one time charges  acquisition related compensation   r d excluding acquisition related compensation and one time charges r d excluding acquisition related compensation and one time charges as percent of revenues research and development r d expenditures in fiscal increased from fiscal and fiscal as cypress continued its effort to accelerate the development of new products and migrate to more advanced process technologies 
in fiscal  spending in cypress s design centers grew due to increased headcount and capital spending 
r d efforts associated with the acquisitions of lara  isd  scanlogic  hiband  imi  alation  radiocom and silicon light machines slm also contributed to the increase in r d expenditures in fiscal cypress believes that its future success will depend on its ability to develop and introduce new products that will compete effectively on the basis of price  performance  and ability to address customer needs 
the major focus of process technology research is the continuous migration to smaller geometries 
during  we were ramping our latest micron technology in manufacturing and simultaneously transferring our micron technology from our eight inch r d fab in san jose  california to our eight inch manufacturing fab in minnesota and initiating development of our micron technology at the san jose r d fab 
the r d fab  which was converted from six inch wafer to eight inch wafer capability in fiscal  is now compatible with our manufacturing fab in minnesota 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
acquisition related compensation charged in fiscal is primarily attributed to the slm  imi  hiband and lara acquisitions 
page we recorded charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal upon reaching an agreement to settle a patent infringement suit for million  of which million pertained to prior periods 
the remainder relates to future product shipments and has been recorded as a prepaid asset that will be expensed over the next three years 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million in r d expense were also written off to r d as one time charges as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative year ended in thousands december  december  january  revenues    selling  general and administrative    sg a as percent of revenues acquisition related compensation   sg a excluding acquisition related compensation   sg a excluding acquisition related compensation as percent of revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased from fiscal due primarily to increased sales and marketing headcount from our acquisitions during the year  acquisition related compensation charges and several major customer support initiatives  including expanded e business capabilities and improvements to the web infrastructure and site 
expenses for legal and professional services related to patent infringement litigation  patent filing and tax services have also contributed to an increase in administrative costs in the periods under comparison 
lower sales commission expenses and employee bonus expenses partially offset these increases 
sg a expenses in fiscal increased from due primarily to increased selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to commission expenses  which have risen in proportion to our revenue growth 
in addition  the marketing area has increased expenditures due to building a worldwide infrastructure 
legal and professional costs related to patent infringement litigation  patent filing and tax services have contributed to increases in administrative costs over the two year period 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
acquisition related compensation charged in fiscal is primarily attributed to the slm  imi  and scanlogic acquisitions 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million were also written off to sg a as one time charges as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal acquisition and other non recurring costs year ended in thousands december  december  january  amortization of intangibles    in process research and development    other non recurring costs    total acquisition and other non recurring costs   we completed six acquisitions during fiscal imi  hiband  scanlogic  lara  isd and silicon packets 
acquisition costs in consisted of in process research and development from these acquisitions and amortization of intangibles related to current and prior acquisitions 
the increase in amortization from fiscal to fiscal relates primarily to the acquisitions of slm  imi  hiband  scanlogic  and lara 
in process research and development charges during fiscal relate to the acquisitions of imi  hiband  scanlogic  lara  isd and silicon packets  which were completed during fiscal the valuation method used to value in process technology is a form of discounted cash flow method commonly known as the percentage of completion approach 
this approach is a widely recognized appraisal method and is commonly used to value technology assets 
the value of the in process technology is the sum of the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology  taking into consideration the percentage of completion of products utilizing this technology  utilization of pre existing technology  the risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and the technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at rates ranging from to 
cypress believes these rates were appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage of completion for in process projects acquired ranged from to for imi  to for hiband  to for scanlogic  to for lara  to for isd and to for silicon packets 
schedules were based on management s estimate of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
as of december   the actual development timelines and costs are in line with management s estimates 
page non recurring charges recorded during fiscal were million 
these charges relate primarily to an impairment loss of million 
based on a review of the intangibles related to our acquisitions and other long lived assets  we recognized an impairment loss of million  the amount by which the carrying value of the acquired existing technology and pro rata portion of the related goodwill exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the existing technology of slm  a part of the non memory business segment 
during  the optical market in which slm participates has experienced a severe economic downturn 
reduced demand for slm s products places increased risk on the future revenue streams anticipated from the existing display and monitor technology 
other non recurring charges recorded during fiscal included a million charge related to the settlement of an intellectual property dispute 
during fiscal  cypress recorded acquisition and merger related costs of million 
costs of million were incurred in relation to the acquisition of slm  which was completed on august  slm acquisition costs consisted of million for in process research and development  and million for the amortization of intangible assets 
additional costs related to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions of anchor chips  inc anchor  arcus technology usa and arcus technology india limited referred to as arcus on a combined basis  the max programmable logic device pld product line from altera  and radiocom were million 
acquisition costs of million were incurred in relation to the acquisitions of galvantech  alation  and radiocom  which consist primarily of non cash deferred compensation charges  legal  accounting and investment banking fees 
in addition  cypress recorded million for in process research and development due to the acquisition of radiocom 
cypress incurred a one time charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal due to the acceleration of contractual obligations related to the arcus acquisition

one time  non recurring costs were million  which included a million write off of a manufacturing asset that was not being used and was subsequently scrapped  and an million one time compensation charge associated with retention and performance payments to key employees in december acquisition related costs incurred during fiscal were million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  cypress recorded one time charges of million associated with the merger with ic works 
these charges were for investment banking fees and other professional fees 
cypress also recorded million in costs associated with the purchase of anchor and arcus consisting of million for in process technology  million for transaction costs and million in amortization of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  cypress acquired altera s max programmable logic device product line and its equity interest in cypress s wafer fabrication facility in round rock  texas 
as part of the transaction  cypress recorded intangible assets associated with the product rights and incurred a charge of million for the amortization of these intangibles 
transaction costs and non cash compensation costs incurred for other acquisitions were million 
restructuring on july   cypress announced a restructuring plan that involved resizing its manufacturing facilities  reducing its workforce  and combining facilities 
the restructuring was precipitated by the worldwide economic slowdown  particularly in the business areas in which cypress operates 
the intended effect of the plan was to size the manufacturing operations and facilities to meet future demand and reduce expenses in all operations areas 
during the third quarter of  cypress recorded restructuring charges of million related to property  plant and equipment  leased facilities and personnel 
cypress expects to recognize a benefit of up to million per quarter from lower depreciation and payroll costs in future periods 
however  the net benefit to the statement of operations will be much less since we are operating at lower output rates and not building inventory that would have otherwise improved the operating results through greater absorption of costs 
page the following table summarizes the restructuring reserve and charges for the year ended december  in thousands provision non cash charges cash charges reserves and write downs at property  plant equipment     leased facilities   personnel     total     the following paragraphs describe in more detail the components of the restructuring charges 
restructuring costs related to property  plant and equipment amounted to million 
in sizing cypress to meet future demand  cypress has taken out of service and is holding for sale manufacturing assets with a net book value of million 
the charge represents the difference between the net book value of the assets less the estimated amount to be realized upon sale of the equipment  net of the estimated cost to dispose of the equipment 
this amount has been recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the assets 
the restructuring affects our facilities in minnesota  texas  california and the philippines 
if the actual amount realized upon the sale of equipment is less than estimated  we would incur an additional charge to earnings 
property  plant and equipment sales and or dispositions are expected to be completed within one year 
in each case  the asset was removed from service prior to september  during the quarter ended september   cypress incurred a million restructuring charge for three excess leased facilities 
the costs to terminate or sublease these facilities are estimated to be approximately million  which is included in other current liabilities 
this estimate is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
costs will be incurred over the remaining terms of the leases  the longest of which is three years 
cypress implemented a reduction in force that affected employees at all significant locations 
under the restructuring plan  cypress announced in july that it would terminate the employment of several hundred persons 
those individuals were notified in july that their employment would cease on september  cypress has terminated the employment of persons  of whom employees had left cypress as of december  the remainder will be leaving during the next six months after the completion of certain projects in which they are involved 
personnel costs related to the reduction in force amounted to million 
severance and related employee benefit costs amounted to million 
for those persons whose employment ended on september   severance costs were paid at that time 
for persons leaving subsequent to september   severance costs will be paid at the time of their separation 
in addition  effective august   the cypress board of directors made a one time decision to extend for those terminated employees the stock option exercise period from one month to twelve months after termination 
cypress recorded non cash stock compensation expense of million for this modification during the quarter ended september  during fiscal  we reversed million of previously provided restructuring costs related to the decision to close down our wafer fab located in san jose  california 
we determined in the second quarter of fiscal that no outstanding commitments related to this restructuring remained 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring credits of million  which included a reversal of million of the restructuring reserve 
the reversed charges of million primarily related to excess accruals for severance and other employee related charges 
we also reversed million of excess fixed asset write downs from the restructuring 
in addition  during fiscal  cypress reversed million of excess fixed assets write downs of the restructuring

the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense due to the conversion on october  of substantially all of the then outstanding notes 
other income expense  net of million  for fiscal primarily reflects a million write down of long term investments  and million related to the amortization of bond issuance costs 
cypress took a charge in the third quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of two long term investments including startup  development stage and technology companies to their estimated net realizable values 
these investments were reduced by million and million to million and million  respectively 
other income and expense  net  for fiscal primarily reflects a million gain on the sale of the fast cmos technology fct product line and a million gain on the disposal of assets partially offset by other items 
other income and expense  net  for fiscal included a million gain from the sale of a certain investment 
other components of other income and expense  net include million related to the amortization of bond issuance costs  and million in foreign exchange gains in taxes cypress s effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
a tax benefit of million was realized during fiscal compared to expenses of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal tax benefit was attributable primarily to current year net operating losses  however  the tax benefit of these losses was limited  under generally accepted accounting principles  since there is uncertainty as to whether the full benefit of these losses may be realized 
accordingly  the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets increased from zero to million from fiscal to  as cypress believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management s assessment was based on the losses incurred in and cypress s projections for future periods 
the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets decreased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal  as cypress believed it would realize the tax benefit of all of its deferred tax assets 
management s assessment was based on cypress s profitability and forecasts for future periods 
as compared to the effective tax rate in fiscal  the fiscal year effective tax rate was also affected by non deductible in process research and development charges and acquisition charges offset by research and development tax credits 
cypress s effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to utilization of loss carryovers  earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates  and tax credits 
cypress s global operations involve manufacturing  research and development  and selling activities outside the us cypress s operations outside the us are in certain countries that impose a statutory tax rate higher than the us  as well as countries that impose a lower statutory tax rate than the us us tax has not been provided on profits from certain us sales  until such profits are repatriated back to the us overall  we expect our foreign earnings to be taxed at a rate lower than the statutory tax rate in the us page extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we retired a total of million principal of our million notes  for million  resulting in a pre tax net gain of million 
the net after tax gain of million was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
pro forma earnings loss previously referred to as earnings before goodwill in addition to our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we provide our stockholders with pro forma financial information 
we believe that our presentation of pro forma results is a useful addition to information provided to our investors 
our presentation of pro forma information excludes non cash expenses resulting from acquisition or issuance of stock options  cash charges for payments based on the achievement of certain performance milestones under acquisition agreements  as well as unusual or infrequent expenses or credits that are not directly attributable to our ongoing operations and are expected to be incurred over a limited period of time 
because of these exclusions  our pro forma presentation is not in accordance with gaap 
additionally  our presentation of pro forma information may not be consistent with that of other companies 
pro forma information is not  and should not be considered  a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
we recognize that we must be consistent in our identification of unusual or infrequent items including both favorable and unfavorable items that meet these criteria 
we continuously review our pro forma practices to improve the presentation of our pro forma results 
we have historically referred to our pro forma net income loss as earnings before goodwill or ebg 
pursuant to our on going review  we will now refer to this information as pro forma net income or loss 
this change will make us more consistent with other companies that provide pro forma financial results 
also  as a result of our on going review  we decided not to adjust earnings or losses for any inventory adjustments in determining pro forma earnings 
this change will be reflected currently and in all future periods and is reflected in the information included below 
previously  we added back to our net loss a million before tax charge for inventory reserves in calculating our pro forma net loss for the third quarter of as reported in both our third quarter press release and in our quarterly report on form q for that quarter and in calculating our pro forma net income presentation in our annual earnings press release issued in january we have not added this charge back to our earnings in the calculation below

the notes are due in  with a coupon rate of and an initial conversion premium of 
the notes are convertible into approximately million shares of common stock and are callable by cypress no earlier than july  on january   cypress completed a million registered placement of year convertible subordinated notes 
the notes are due in  with a coupon rate of and an initial conversion premium of 
the notes are convertible into approximately million shares of common stock and are callable by cypress no earlier than february  cypress has entered into several synthetic operating lease agreements for manufacturing and office facilities 
synthetic leases are leases that qualify as capital leases for tax purposes  but qualify as operating leases for financial reporting 
as such  synthetic leases represent a form of off balance sheet financing 
the synthetic leases to which cypress is a party require periodic payments that vary based on the london interbank offering rate libor  plus a spread 
each of these leases provide cypress with an option for renewal at mutually agreed upon terms  to acquire the property at the lessor s cost or to arrange for the property to be acquired by a third party at market value 
if cypress had exercised its right to purchase all the off balance sheet leases at december   it would have been required to make a payment and record assets totaling million 
cypress is required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for these leases 
as of december   the amount of restricted cash recorded was million  which was classified as a non current asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
the leases also contain financial covenants 
cypress was not in compliance with the financial covenants of one of the agreements at december  in february  cypress obtained a waiver for this default and renegotiated the covenants for future periods 
while cypress expects to maintain compliance with the covenants  our ability to meet these financial covenants can be effected by events beyond its control and we cannot assure you that we will meet these covenants in the future 
at december   cypress had purchase commitments aggregating million  principally for manufacturing equipment  and facilities and bulk gas and nitrogen 
these commitments relate to purchases to be made in of million and the remainder is committed through in june  cypress borrowed million yen at from sumitomo bank japan in order to set up and fund our japanese business operations 
borrowing under this arrangement  which aggregated million at december   are due in fiscal in the next twelve months the current economic downturn may negatively impact cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations  however  cypress believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet present and anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
beyond twelve months  a continuation of the economic downturn  changes in market demand and the possible need to change manufacturing capacity and capability  may cause cypress to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing 
although additional financing may be required  there can be no assurance that it would be available to cypress or available at terms cypress deems satisfactory

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  reserves for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  long lived assets  investments  restructuring charges  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when title and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we allow certain distributors  primarily based in the united states  extensive rights of return and other credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits issuable to these distributors  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
our method of deferral is based on certain assumptions  including average gross margins 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future operating results could be adversely affected 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for these situations based on our experience with specific customers and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
at december  and december  our reserves for sales returns were million and million  respectively 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of million at december  and million at december  valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves  obsolescence reserves and research and development reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds nine months of demand for that device and when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than six months 
our inventories represent high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
likewise  if we sell more inventory  or at more favorable prices than we have forecasted  our future margins may be higher 
page valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our long lived assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded amounted to million at december  and million at december  our other long lived assets are principally comprised of intangible assets from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method 
we assess the impairment in value to our company of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant changes in company strategy 
if our review determines the future undiscounted cash flows related to these assets will not be sufficient to recover their carrying value we will reduce the carrying values of these assets down to our estimate of fair market value and continue depreciating them over their remaining useful lives 
our estimates of fair market value are generally based on discounted cash flow analyses or outside appraisals 
subsequent events in january the department of commerce revoked a antidumping order that had been imposed on srams fabricated in taiwan and imported into the united states 
the customs service was ordered to refund  with interest  all duties deposited under the antidumping order 
between and cypress incurred million to costs of revenues for such duties 
as of february   cypress has received million of the refund and expects million during the remainder of the refunds will be recorded as an offset to cost of revenues and the interest will be recorded as interest income as received 
during  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of convertible subordinated notes 
in january  we repurchased a total principal amount of million for million  resulting in a pre tax net gain of million 
the net after tax gain will be recorded as an extraordinary item in the consolidated statements of operations 
cumulatively we have repurchased million in principal 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 cypress will be required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment assessment 
cypress will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal cypress has not yet determined what impact sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in accordance with fas no 
 cypress has not amortized goodwill on acquisitions completed after july  cypress will stop amortizing goodwill for all other acquisitions on december  the first day of fiscal 
goodwill amortization was million in page in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which cypress will adopt in fiscal sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
cypress does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
while sfas no 
carries forward many of the provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 some of the key differences in the new standard are that goodwill is excluded from its scope  assets to be abandoned will be viewed as held for use and amortized over their remaining service period  and the standard broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
cypress will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal cypress does not expect the adoption of fas no 
will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf issue no 
generally requires companies to present consideration given to a customer as a reduction of revenue 
eitf issue no 
will be adopted in the first quarter of and will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates cypress is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  cypress utilizes derivative financial instruments 
cypress does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of cypress s investment portfolio  which is primarily invested in commercial paper and other similar instruments would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of cypress s investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of cypress s debt obligations 
a majority of cypress s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  cypress does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  cypress has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
cypress s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
based on cypress s overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar  relative to the japanese yen or the euro  would have an immaterial effect on cypress s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on cypress s balances as of december  equity options at december   cypress had outstanding a series of equity options on cypress common stock in the amount of million 
the options require physical settlement and expire in march and june upon expiration of the options  if cypress s stock price is above the trigger price  cypress will have its capital returned with a premium 
if below the trigger price  cypress will receive a specified number of shares of cypress common stock instead of a return of capital 
the range of the trigger prices is 
the transaction is recorded in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
at december   cypress had outstanding  put options on cypress common stock with a strike price 
upon expiration of the options  if cypress s stock price is below the strike price  cypress could take delivery of the underlying shares and be required to pay million 
if above the strike price  cypress will have no further obligations 
the transaction is recorded in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
investments in development stage companies cypress has also invested in several privately held companies  all of which can be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
at december   cypress had invested million  directly or indirectly  in development stage companies  all of which could be lost if the companies are not successful 
stock purchase assistance plan cypress has loaned million to employees under the shareholder approved stock purchase assistance plan for the purpose of purchasing cypress common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
each loan was evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and was secured by all of the employee s assets  as well as  a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
cypress maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts 
for the period ending december   cypress has written off thousand of such loans 
if the price of cypress common stock declined from its year end level of by  cypress s exposure to loans with the underlying common stock collateral worth less than the face value of the notes would be million
