critical accounting policies impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets the fair value of the long lived assets is dependant on the performance of the operations which the corporation owns 
in assessing potential impairment for these assets the corporation will consider this factor as well as the forecasted financial performance 
if the forecast is not met and the outlook does not provide for sufficient cash flow to recoup the investments  the corporation may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
in assessing the recoverability of the corporation s goodwill and other intangibles the corporation must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the corporation may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
carrying value of the corporation s net deferred tax assets assumes that the corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the corporation may be required to record additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the corporation s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowance quarterly 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
examples include provisions for bad debts  inventory reserves  reclamation reserves and pension liabilities
