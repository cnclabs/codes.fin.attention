item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we develop  market and sell equipment to cable television operators  telecom carriers and satellite network operators  who use our products to deliver broadband voice  video and data services to residential and business subscribers 
we strive to deliver the most innovative broadband data  video and voice solutions that enable service providers to accelerate the deployment of revenue generating services today and tomorrow 
we sell our products to cable operators and other providers of broadband services through direct sales forces in north america  south america  europe and asia 
we also distribute our products through resellers and system integrators 
we are structured around and our sales are derived from the following operating 
table of contents segments cable broadband access systems cable and telecom carrier systems telecom 
the products sold in cable consists of our proprietary s cdma products  our cherrypicker digital video management system and the multigate telephony and data access system  which are sold primarily to cable operators for the deployment of data  video and voice services over the existing cable infrastructure 
the products sold in telecom consists of our miniplex dsl multiplexer system  the iptl dslam  mainsail mmap and mainsail iad  which are sold to broadband service providers for the deployment of voice and data services over the existing copper wire infrastructure 
currently  of our revenues are derived from cable and from telecom 
during and  we acquired companies in order to expand our portfolio of broadband products to support high speed delivery of voice  data and video services over cable  dsl and wireless 
for more information relating to the acquisitions  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we sustained a net loss of million in the year ended december  and million in we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  a significant portion of the current year loss was due to the write off of intangible assets and restructuring charges  but was partially offset by extraordinary gains resulting from our buy back of a majority of our convertible debt 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future sales  and we expect that a significant portion of our expenses will be committed in advance of sales 
we expect to continue to increase our expenditures in technical development and sales and marketing as we engage in activities related to product enhancement and increasing market penetration 
additionally  we expect to increase our capital expenditures and other operating expenses in order to support our operations 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures and approximately million to million on research and development during the year ending december  anticipated capital expenditures consist of purchases of additional test equipment to support higher levels of production and computer hardware  furniture and leasehold improvements for our facilities  expanded geographical implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and software and equipment for newly hired employees 
as a result of these anticipated increased operating expenses  we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  bad debt reserves  inventory reserves  impairment of long lived assets  warranty returns and contingencies to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of the selling price 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
bad debt reserves 
we evaluate our trade receivables based upon a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for customers based upon other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further reduced 

table of contents inventory reserves 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
we have adjusted our reserves significantly in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as fluctuations in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
if future demand is less favorable than we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had million of long term investments and million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
if the forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of impairment losses related to our long term investments 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and will be required to analyze our remaining indefinite lived assets  including goodwill for impairment during the first six months of  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
warranty reserves 
we provide a standard warranty for most of our products  generally lasting one year from the date of purchase 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  resulting in decreased gross profits 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  acquisition and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  resulting in higher net loss 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we sell our products directly to broadband service providers  and to a lesser extent  resellers and system integrators 
revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our existing agreements typically do not contain price protection provisions and generally do not grant return rights beyond those provided by our standard warranty 
revenues consist primarily of sales of products to new and existing customers providing broadband services 
the global economic downturn contributed significantly to the decline in both north america and international revenues in our revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in revenues in north america  which includes the united 
table of contents states and canada decreased to million in  down from million in revenues from international locations decreased to million in down from million in revenues from cable amounted to million for the year ended december   down from million in although we shipped slightly more modems in than in  average selling prices asps declined year over year as ongoing competitive pricing pressures affected revenue performance in several of our product offerings 
revenues from telecom were million  down from million in we have a relatively small customer base  and revenues were impacted by declines in telecom industry spending 
the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband products has resulted in significant price erosion over time 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on our unit asps 
a key component of our strategy is to decrease the cost of manufacturing our products to offset the decline in asp 
we intend to continue to implement cost reduction efforts  including design changes and manufacturing efficiencies 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing operations group 
the cost of the manufacturing operations group includes assembly  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in the year ended december   cost of goods sold decreased to million from million in for the years ended december  and  we incurred special charges of million and million  respectively  relating to vendor cancellation charges and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  also included approximately million of amortization of acquired intangible assets compared to million in excluding special charges and amortization of intangible assets  cost of goods sold decreased million or due primarily to lower sales  largely offset by the usage  in the first three quarters of  of higher priced inventories purchased in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
we achieved a gross profit of million or of sales in the year ended december  compared to million or in the decrease in our gross profit was largely the result of lower asps due to competitive pricing pressures  a shift in our sales to lower margin cpe  utilization of higher priced inventory primarily purchased in  and special charges described above 
during  we anticipate further decreases in our asps and continued pressure on our margins  and we expect to continue to see decreasing margins in unless and until we can produce lower cost products 
these asp decreases  without a corresponding decrease in our product costs  will likely have an adverse impact on our operating results in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  internally designed prototype material expenditures  equipment and supplies required to develop and enhance our products 
research and development expenses increased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in increases in research and development spending are attributable to the development of our new line of standards based products  which we believe will be commercially available for shipments in the third quarter of also included in research and development costs is the amortization of intangible assets of approximately million in compared to million in we believe it is critical to continue to make significant investments in research and development to create innovative technologies and products that meet the current and future requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we expect in future years to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development programs 
in process research and development 
there were no charges for in process research and development in the year ending december  we incurred charges of million in the year ended december   related to research and development projects in process at companies that we acquired  in chronological order  telegate ltd 
telegate  access network electronics division of tyco electronics corporation ane  combox ltd 
combox  certain assets of internet telecom ltd 
internet telecom  ultracom communications holding ltd 
ultracom  digital transmission equipment digitrans and mainsail networks  inc mainsail at the time of the acquisitions 
at the date of each acquisition  the projects 
table of contents identified as in process research and development required additional efforts in order to establish technological feasibility 
in process technology acquired relating to the acquisition of mainsail in  was valued at approximately million and consisted primarily of additions to mainsail s core technology  which was related to mainsail s planned development of new features 
the resultant technology provides a high capacity cpe and a low cost gateway 
this development was completed in in process technology acquired relating to the acquisitions of telegate  combox  internet telecom  ane  ultracomm and digitrans  all in  was valued at approximately million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
during  we decided not to pursue any further development efforts on these projects 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for sales personnel  marketing and support personnel  and costs related to trade shows  consulting and travel 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased headcount as well as increased spending for promotional activities  such as tradeshows  consulting fees for public relations and advertising and print advertising 
amortization of intangible assets included in sales and marketing expenses accounted for approximately million in compared to million in we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand our operations and release new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary and benefits for administrative officers and support personnel  travel expenses and legal  accounting and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the increase is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets of million in compared to only million in as well as increased headcount to support our operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we expand our operations 
goodwill amortization 
the amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions completed during and decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this decrease was due to the write down of million of acquired intangible assets during upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january   we will no longer be required to amortize the goodwill assets associated with our acquisitions from and restructuring costs and asset write offs 
in march  we evaluated the carrying value of certain long lived assets and acquired intangibles  consisting primarily of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
pursuant to accounting rules  the majority of the goodwill was recorded based on stock prices at the time acquisition agreements were executed and announced 
goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the assets to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment is based on the fair value of the assets  typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital  which represents the blended costs of debt and equity 
downturns in the broadband services and telecommunications markets created unique circumstances with regard to the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets for recoverability 
as a result of our decision to suspend certain product lines and product development efforts during  intangible assets totaling million relating to certain acquisitions were deemed to be impaired with no future value and were written off 
further  the aforementioned downturns in the principal markets in which we continue to operate  have negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and cash flows from certain other companies 
table of contents acquired during fiscal and in accordance with our policy  the comparison of the discounted expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related intangible assets resulted in a write down of these assets related to both our cable and telecom segments of million during during  we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million and corresponding reduction of goodwill  for the tax benefit of foreign net operating loss carryforwards relating to a previous acquisition 
due to the impairment write off  the remaining net deferred tax liability was also written off 
we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of million and a write down of impaired assets in the amount of million for the year ended december  the write down of million related to fixed assets acquired from ane which were determined to have no remaining useful life 
of the total restructuring charges  million relates to employee termination costs covering technical  production and administrative employees 
as of december   approximately employees have been terminated and we paid approximately million in termination costs 
the remaining million of restructuring charges relates primarily to costs for excess leased facilities 
included in the remaining million are million of charges incurred in the fourth quarter for revisions in estimates of excess facility charges 
as of december   we paid approximately million related to lease costs 
at december   restructuring charges of million remain accrued  primarily related to excess facility costs and employee terminations 
we anticipate utilizing the remaining restructuring accrual  which relates to servicing operating lease payments or negotiated buyout of operating lease commitments  through we expect reductions in our overall operating expenses as a result of the headcount reductions 
interest income and expense 
interest income was million in the year ended december  compared to million in interest expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million in interest income primarily consisted of income from our cash and short term investments and decreased during due to lower invested cash balances 
interest expense was primarily due to the sale in july of million of convertible subordinated notes due in august notes 
during  we repurchased approximately million in principal of the notes 
this repurchase will reduce interest expense in future periods 
other expense 
other expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in during  we wrote down approximately million of certain investments in privately held companies which we felt were impaired given their recent economic performance and considering current market conditions 
income taxes 
we have generated operating losses since our inception 
for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million which represents the write off of deferred tax assets and remaining net deferred tax liabilities previously recorded for purchased acquired intangibles  net of miscellaneous foreign income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and extraordinary gain 
we recorded an extraordinary gain on the repurchase of some of the notes 
during the year ended december   we recorded an extraordinary gain of million as the result of such repurchases 
years ended december  and revenues 
our revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increased revenues in were largely attributable to continuing deployments of our teracomm system by new and existing customers 
in addition  sales of products from acquired companies accounted for approximately million of the increased revenues in the year ended december  cost of goods sold 
in the year ended december   we incurred cost of goods sold of million compared to million in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  also included approximately million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and a special charge of million for vendor cancellation fees 
our cost of goods sold increased in the year ended december  
table of contents  compared to  primarily due to increased product shipments and the inclusion of the amortization expense relating to acquired intangible assets 
gross profit 
we achieved a gross profit of million in the year ended december  compared to million in this improvement in our gross profit was largely the result of increased product shipments and continued cost reduction efforts  including the further integration of application specific integrated circuit asic components  other design changes and manufacturing efficiencies that aided us in the early part of the year  but were offset by slower demand beginning in the fourth quarter 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of declined as the result of lower than expected revenues  a shift in the mix of product shipped and an increase in inventory reserves 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily the result of increased personnel costs 
the increased personnel costs were a result of the expansion of our employee base and the inclusion of employees from acquired companies as we continued to focus our efforts on developing new products 
cost of product development assistance agreement 
in march  we entered into a one year product development assistance agreement with rogers communications inc under the terms of the development agreement  rogers was obligated to assist us with the characterization and testing of our subscriber end and head end voice over cable equipment 
in addition  rogers was obligated to provide us with technology to assist us with our efforts to develop high quality  field proved technology solutions that are docsis compliant and packet cable compliant 
the development agreement had a term of one year 
in consideration of rogers entering into the development agreement  we issued rogers two fully vested and non forfeitable warrants  each to purchase million shares of common stock on a cashless basis 
one warrant had a exercise price of per share and one warrant had an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the two warrants was approximately million and resulted in a non cash charge included in operations over the one year term of the development agreement 
as a result of the development agreement  our results for the year ended december  include a non cash charge of million compared to million in in march  rogers purchased  shares of our common stock on a net exercise basis  resulting in no proceeds to us 
in process research and development 
we incurred charges of million in the year ended december  related to research and development projects in process at telegate  ane  combox  internet telecom  ultracom  mainsail  and digitrans at the time of the acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we incurred charges of million related to research and development projects in process at radwiz and imedia at the time of the acquisitions 
the projects identified as in process required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to increased payroll costs related to additional sales and support personnel necessary to support the expansion of our customer base  increased payroll and associated costs from the expansion in our employee base resulting from acquired companies and increased commissions related to higher sales 
workforce amortization accounted for approximately million of the increase 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to costs associated with the increased infrastructure required to support our expanded activities and increased personnel costs associated with acquired companies 
goodwill amortization 
the amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions completed during totaled million and accounted for the significant increase in goodwill amortization in as compared to interest income and expense 
interest income was million in the year ended december  compared to million in interest expense was million in the year ended december  
table of contents compared to  in the increases to interest income and interest expense were due to the sale of million of notes resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
other expense 
other expense for the year ended december  consisted primarily of approximately million in amortization of debt issuance costs   in amortization of warrants issued in conjunction with a debt obligation  and million loss on sale of property and equipment 
income taxes 
we have generated operating losses since our inception 
due to our inability to recognize a benefit from these operating losses  we had no provision for income taxes in and litigation in september  a group of prospective investors in imedia corporation imedia  now our subsidiary  named imedia as a defendant in an action alleging that imedia breached its term sheet with the plaintiffs when imedia negotiated its acquisition by us and  as a result  did not permit plaintiffs to invest in imedia 
the plaintiffs sought damages in excess of million 
the terms of the imedia agreement and plan of merger and reorganization provided that shares of our common stock that were to be issued to the former shareholders of imedia were placed in escrow to indemnify us for any damages that are directly or indirectly suffered by us as a result of plaintiffs claims 
the value of the escrowed shares was approximately million based on the market value of our common stock on or about the closing date of the acquisition 
on or about september   the company received an amended complaint complaint in a matter captioned evergreen canada israel management  ltd 
v 
imedia corporation  case no 
 pending in the superior court of the state of california for the city and county of san francisco 
the complaint alleged both i intentional interference with contractual relations and ii intentional interference with prospective economic advantage against us  claiming that we formed and operated a conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity to invest in imedia 
plaintiffs argued that  prior to our purchase of the imedia shares  we knew of an alleged  pre existing financing agreement between plaintiffs and imedia that contained a no shop clause  prohibiting imedia from seeking or obtaining financing from any other sources  including apparently  in plaintiffs view a prohibition against imedia selling its own stock or engaging in related transactions that preceded the acquisition 
we were subsequently served with the complaint and filed a demurrer challenging the legal sufficiency of the two causes of action 
other defendants demurred also 
the demurrer hearing was held on january  prior to the court issuing a final ruling at that hearing  plaintiffs agreed to amend their complaint 
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and  in response  we and all other defendants filed demurrers challenging all the causes of action 
our demurrer was heard on may   and the court ruled by subsequent written decision that three contract claims and the tortuous interference with the prospective economic advantage claims should be dismissed 
the court also dismissed the two fraud claims with leave to amend 
the plaintiffs then filed a third amended complaint  and the defendants and motions to strike challenging that pleading 
a hearing date on the demurrers was set in november for march  the demurrers and motions to strike were argued on november  prior to a ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike  the parties entered into a settlement agreement in which plaintiffs dismissed all claims with prejudice 
the parties agreed that the settlement agreement would not be construed to be an admission of any liability on the part of the company or any of the other defendants 
the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on march  beginning in april  several plaintiffs filed lawsuits against us and certain of our officers and directors in federal court 
the plaintiff in the first of these lawsuits purported to represent a class whose members purchased our securities between february  and april  the complaint alleged that the defendants had violated the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information regarding our technology 
the allegations in the other lawsuits were substantially the same and  on august   all of these lawsuits were consolidated in the united states district court  northern district of california 
the consolidated lawsuit is named in re terayon communication systems  inc securities litigation  case no 
c mhp 
the court hearing the consolidated action 
table of contents has appointed lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs counsel pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act 
on september   the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint containing factual allegations nearly identical to those in the original lawsuits 
the consolidated class action complaint  however  alleged claims on behalf of a class whose members purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between november  and april  on october   defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint 
on march   after defendants motion had been fully briefed and argued  the court issued an order granting in part defendants motion and giving plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
on april   plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint 
on june   defendants moved to dismiss this new complaint and oral argument on the motion occurred on december  as of march   we have not received an order from the court regarding the motion to dismiss argued on december  the lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages  in addition to other forms of relief 
we consider the lawsuits to be without merit and we intend to defend vigorously against these allegations 
however  the litigation could prove to be costly and time consuming to defend  and there can be no assurances about the eventual outcome 
on october   a lawsuit was filed against the company and the individual defendants zaki rakib  selim rakib  and raymond fritz in the superior court of san luis obispo county  california 
this lawsuit is titled bertram v 
terayon communications systems  inc  case no 
cv bertram 
the bertram complaint contains factual allegations similar to those alleged in the federal securities class action lawsuit 
the complaint asserts causes of action under california business professions code sections et seq 
and et seq 
for unlawful business practices  unfair and fraudulent business practices  and false and misleading advertising 
plaintiffs purport to bring the action on behalf of themselves and as representatives of all persons or entities in the state of california and such other persons or entities outside california that have been and are adversely affected by defendants activity  and as the court shall determine is not inconsistent with the exercise of the court s jurisdiction 
plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief 
defendants removed the beltram case to the united states district  central district of california and  on january   filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
a hearing on defendants motion was held march  and the court granted defendants motion to dismiss the action and denied plaintiffs motion requesting remand 
on april   defendants moved for an order requiring further proceedings  if any to take place in the northern district of california 
plaintiffs did not oppose this motion and eventually entered into a stipulation to go forward in the northern district 
on july   a status conference was held in this case before judge patel 
plaintiffs did not appear for the conference  and the court requested that defendants submit an order dismissing the bertram action with prejudice  which the defendants have submitted to the court 
we believe that these allegations  as with the allegations in the federal securities case  are without merit and intends to contest the matter vigorously 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
in july  we issued million of notes  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are our general unsecured obligation and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time on or after october  through maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased 
interest is payable semiannually 
debt issuance costs related to the notes were approximately million 
in  we repurchased approximately million of the notes for million in cash and million in stock  resulting in an extraordinary gain of approximately million net of million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 

table of contents cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million provided in in  significant uses of cash from operating activities included our losses from operations as well as a decrease in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by decreases in inventory and other current assets of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in were primarily due to increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  mostly offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million as well as the loss from operations of million 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of short term investments in and cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million provided by financing activities in in  we paid approximately million to repurchase a portion of the notes and million to retire short and long term debt 
we received a total of million from the exercise of stock options 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of the notes as well as proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
this estimate is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under the risk factor our operating results may fluctuate below and elsewhere 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
we may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  financing under leasing arrangements or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations long term debt operating lease obligations other obligations total contractual commitments we have unconditional purchase obligations to certain of our suppliers that support our ability to manufacture our products 
the obligations require us to purchase minimum quantities of the suppliers products at a specified price 
during fiscal year  we recorded special charges of million relating to vendor cancellation fees 
as of december   we had approximately million of purchase obligations  of which million is included on the balance sheet as accrued vendor cancellation charges 
the remaining obligations are expected to become payable at various times through mid 
table of contents other commercial commitments are as follows in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over other commercial commitments committed year years years years standby letters of credit total commercial commitments recent financial accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued fas no

the provisions of fas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of adopting fas no 
has been evaluated by us  and does not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  statement requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investments no longer be amortized 
we will apply statement beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of statement will significantly reduce amortization expense that was approximately million in fiscal we will reclassify identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives  as defined by statement  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of based on the preliminary unaudited analysis completed to date  we do not believe that the application of these statements will have an adverse material impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents we have a history of losses 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we began shipping products commercially in june  and we have been shipping products in volume since the first quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that we will continue to experience net losses for the foreseeable future 
we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues 
in addition  significant delays in our commercialization of new products will adversely affect our business 
moreover  even though we have experienced significant revenue growth since our inception  the profit potential of our business remains unproven 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that could affect our revenues include  among others  the following variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  variations in the size of the orders by our customers  new product introductions by competitors  delays in our introduction of new products  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  delays by our customers in the completion of upgrades to their cable infrastructures  variations in capital spending budgets of broadband service providers  and adoption of industry standards and the inclusion in or compatibility of our technology with any such standards 
a variety of factors affecting our gross margin include  among others  the following the sales mix of our products  the volume of products manufactured  the type of distribution channel through which we sell our products  the asps of our products  and the costs of manufacturing our products and the effectiveness of our cost reduction measures 
we anticipate that unit asps of our products will continue to decline in the future 
this could cause a decrease in the gross margins for these products 
in addition  the gross margins we realize from the sale of our products are affected by the mix of product sales between higher margin  lower volume headend equipment  such as cmtss  and lower margin  higher volume cpe  such as modems 
we typically sell more headend equipment in connection with new deployments of our systems 
as deployments mature  we tend to sell more cpe into the deployments compared to headend equipment 
sales of our cpe have constituted  and we expect will continue to constitute  a significant portion of our revenues 
our expenses generally vary from quarter to quarter depending on the level of actual and anticipated business activities 
moreover  our research and development expenses increase as we develop new products and our development programs move to wafer fabrication and prototype development 
we are dependent on a small number of customers 
a substantial majority of our revenues have been and will continue to be derived from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
three customers one of which is a related party accounted for approximately 
table of contents of our revenues for the year ended december  the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  sales to our customers are and will continue to be focused on a limited number of projects 
the markets we serve are undergoing significant consolidation in both north america and internationally  as a limited number of service providers control an increasing number of systems 
currently  ten cable operators in the united states own and operate facilities passing approximately of total homes passed 
in addition  the north american dsl market is concentrated with the major ilecs constituting a significant percentage of the market 
as a result  our sales have been and will continue to be dependent upon product acceptance by the leading broadband service providers 
the timing and size of each customer s order is critical to our operating results 
our major customers have significant negotiating leverage and sometimes attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which we do business with them 
these customers may decide to purchase competitive products from other vendors at any time and can reschedule or cancel purchase orders on short notice 
when purchasing product from us  these customers are requiring longer payment terms than in the past  which requires us to maintain additional capital to meet our working capital needs 
reduced spending in the cable and telecom industries has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our operations 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other adverse consequences 
we acquired ten companies from september through december we may acquire additional companies in the future 
during  we wrote down approximately million in intangible assets relating to these acquisitions 
the process of integrating any such acquired company into our business and operations may be risky and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures going forward 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
future acquisitions also could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
even if available  this financing may be dilutive 
the sales cycle for our products is lengthy 
the sales cycle for our products typically is lengthy  often lasting six months to more than a year 
our customers typically conduct significant technical evaluations of competing technologies prior to making a purchasing decision 
in addition  purchasing decisions may be delayed because of our customers internal budget approval procedures 
sales also generally are subject to customer trials  which typically last more than three months 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
there are many risks associated with our participation in docsis 
in january  cablelabs announced that it had finished specifications for an advanced generation of cable modems called docsis docsis incorporates two advanced physical layer modulation techniques  s cdma and a tdma  that four companies  including us  had helped to develop over a period of four years 
cablelabs further announced that test plans were being finalized to allow for interoperability testing in the first quarter of this year and possible certification testing in the third quarter pending product maturity 
in connection with the finalization of the docsis specification  we have contributed some aspects of our current proprietary s cdma technology to a royalty free intellectual property pool established by cablelabs to the extent that the technology is included in the docsis specification 
regardless of our contribution of intellectual property to the royalty free intellectual property pool established for docsis  
table of contents our products may not pass the testing required by cablelabs for our products to be docsis qualified or certified  which could offset our future revenues and operation results 
the royalty free pool established by cablelabs for docsis facilitates the participation of as many vendors as possible in providing equipment that is compatible with the docsis specification 
as a result  any of our competitors who join the docsis intellectual property pool would have access to these aspects of our technology and would not be required to pay us any royalties or other compensation for the use of our technology 
if a competitor is able to duplicate the functionality and capabilities of our technology  we could lose some or all of the time to market advantage we might otherwise have due to our familiarity with s cdma 
this may adversely affect our future revenues and operating results 
we believe the addition of advanced upstream physical layer phy capabilities to docsis in the docsis specification could increase the overall market for docsis compatible products and  as such  could result in increased competition in the cable modem market 
this competition could come from existing competitors or from new competitors who enter the market 
this increased competition is likely to result in lower asps of cable products and could harm revenues and gross margins 
because our competitors will be able to incorporate some aspects of our technology into their products  our current customers may choose alternate suppliers or choose to purchase docsis compliant cable products with advanced phy capabilities from multiple suppliers 
we may be unable to produce docsis compliant cable products with advanced phy capabilities more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
as a result of the inclusion of s cdma technology in the docsis specification  competition for the services of our existing employees who have experience with s cdma could increase 
the loss of these employees to one or more competitors could harm our business 
docsis standards have not yet been accepted in europe and asia 
an alternate specification for cable products  called the euro docsis specification  has been formalized  and some european cable system operators have embraced it 
we intend to develop and sell products that comply with the euro docsis specification and to pursue having portions of our s cdma technology included in a future version of the euro docsis specification 
we may be unsuccessful in these efforts 
we need to develop new products in order to remain competitive 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  market and sell new products in a timely manner 
we also must respond to competitive pressures  evolving industry standards and technological advances 
we are developing products that include both s cdma and a tdma  the two modulation techniques required by the docsis specification 
there is no guarantee that our products will pass testing to be docsis certified or qualified 
if we are unable to certify or qualify our products as docsis compliant in a timely manner  we may lose some or all of the time to market advantage we might otherwise have had  and our future operating results may be adversely affected 
although we sell docsis systems  the majority of our sales are derived from our proprietary s cdma products  which are not docsis compliant 
last year  there were instances where our customers and potential customers delayed or canceled purchases of our proprietary products in order to purchase products that comply with the docsis specification 
in addition  there were instances where our existing customers and potential new customers purchased docsis compliant products from one or more of our competitors rather than purchasing our products 
we believe that this may be an increasing trend in the future as service providers look to purchase docsis certified or qualified products 
as a result  we have reduced our prices and continue to experience customer demand to further reduce our prices in order to promote sales of our current products 
this has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results and gross margin 
average selling prices of broadband access equipment typically decrease 
the broadband access market has been characterized by erosion of asps 
we expect this to continue 
this erosion is due to a number of factors  including competition  rapid technological change and price performance enhancements 
the asps for our products may be lower than expected as a result of competitive 
table of contents pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments 
we anticipate that asps and gross margins for our products will decrease over their life cycles 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards is further eroding asps  particularly for cable modems and other similar cpe 
it is likely that widespread adoption of industry standards will result in increased retail distribution of cable modems and other similar cpe  which could put further price pressure on our products 
decreasing asps could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units sold increases 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future revenue and operating results due to asp erosion 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline 
we must achieve cost reductions 
certain of our competitors currently offer products at prices lower than ours 
market acceptance of our products will depend in part on reductions in the unit cost of our products 
we expect that as cmts equipment becomes more widely deployed  the price of cable modems and other similar cpe will decline 
in particular  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards such as docsis will cause increased price competition for cpe 
however  we may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with other equipment manufacturers 
even if we achieve certain cost reductions  it is not certain that these efforts will allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures or lead to gross margin improvement 
some of our competitors are larger and manufacture products in significantly greater quantities than we currently intend to manufacture for the foreseeable future 
consequently  these competitors have more leverage in obtaining favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers 
in order to remain competitive  we must significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products 
even if we are successful  our redesign may be delayed or may contain significant errors and product defects 
in addition  any redesign may not result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce significantly the list price of our products or improve our gross margin 
reductions in our manufacturing costs will require us to use more highly integrated components in future products and may require us to enter into high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreements 
volume purchase or manufacturing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms 
we could incur expenses without related revenues if we enter into a high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreement and then decide that we cannot use the products or services offered by the agreement 
we have incurred cancellation charges in the past and may incur such charges in the future 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
service providers may adopt alternative technologies or may deploy alternative services that are incompatible with our products 
in january  cablelabs announced that it had finished specifications for an advanced generation of cable modems called docsis docsis incorporates two advanced physical layer modulation techniques  s cdma and a tdma 
we believe that  as docsis gains acceptance among cable operators  our future success depends on our ability to manufacture  market and sell cable products certified and qualified as meeting the docsis specification 
our inability to produce docsis compliant cable products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors may adversely affect our future results of operations 
broadband access services have not achieved widespread market acceptance  and many competing technologies exist 
our success will depend upon the widespread acceptance of broadband services by providers and end users 
the markets for these services are not fully developed 
we cannot accurately predict the future growth 
table of contents rate or the ultimate size of the market for broadband services 
potential users of our products may have concerns regarding the security  reliability  cost  ease of installation and use and capability of broadband services in general 
the markets for our products may be impacted by the development of other technologies that enable the provisioning of broadband services and the deployment of services over other media 
widespread acceptance of other technologies or deployment of services over media not supported by our products could materially limit acceptance of our products 
broadband services based on our products and technology may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance by service providers and end users 
we may not be successful in marketing and selling these products 
we need to develop additional distribution channels 
we presently market our products to service providers 
with changes in the industry  we may need to establish new  additional distribution channels 
for example  we believe that much of the north american market for cpe may shift to a retail distribution model 
accordingly  we may need to redirect our future marketing efforts to sell our cpe directly to retail distributors and end users 
this shift would require us to establish new distribution channels for these products 
we face many challenges in establishing these new distribution channels 
these challenges include  among others  the following our inability to hire additional personnel necessary to establish and enhance these new distribution channels  to the extent that large consumer electronics companies enter the cable modem market  their well established retail distribution capabilities would provide them with a significant competitive advantage  our potential customers are likely to prefer purchasing products from established manufacturing companies that can demonstrate the capability to supply large volumes of products on short notice  and many of our potential customers may be reluctant to adopt technologies that have not gained acceptance among other providers of similar services 
this reluctance could result in lengthy product testing and acceptance cycles for our products 
consequently  the impediments to our initial sales may be even greater than those to later sales 
the vast majority of our sales are to larger  more established service providers that are critical to our business 
we do not have access to smaller or geographically diverse service providers 
although we intend to establish strategic relationships with leading distributors worldwide to access these customers  we may not succeed in establishing these relationships 
even if we do establish these relationships  the distributors may not succeed in marketing our products to their customers 
some of our competitors have already established  long standing relationships with these service providers that may limit our and our distributors ability to sell our products to those customers 
even if we were to sell our products to those customers  it would likely not be based on long term commitments  and those customers would be able to terminate their relationships with us at any time 
we are dependent on service providers choosing to offer additional services to their customers 
we depend on service providers to purchase our products 
service providers have a limited amount of available bandwidth over which they can offer new services  such as high speed internet access and telephony 
they may choose not to provide these new services to their customers 
when service providers choose to provide these new services  we depend upon them to market these services to their customers  to install our equipment and to provide support to end users 
in addition  we depend on these service providers to continue to maintain their infrastructures in a manner that allows us to provide consistently high performance and reliable services 

table of contents sales of our cable products are dependent on the cable industry upgrading to two way cable infrastructure 
demand for our cable products will depend  to a significant degree  upon the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable operators for implementation of access systems for data transmission over cable networks 
this involves the enabling of two way transmission over existing coaxial cable networks and the eventual upgrade to hybrid fiber coaxial hfc in areas of higher penetration of data services 
if cable operators fail to complete these upgrades of their cable infrastructures in a timely and satisfactory manner  the market for our products could be limited 
in addition  few businesses in the united states currently have cable access 
cable operators may not choose to upgrade existing residential cable systems or to install new cable systems to serve business locations 
the success and future growth of our cable business will be subject to economic and other factors affecting the cable television industry generally  particularly its ability to finance substantial capital expenditures 
capital spending levels in the cable industry in the united states and internationally have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we believe that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
we are currently experiencing reduced levels of spending in the cable industry 
the capital spending patterns of cable operators are dependent on a variety of factors  including the following the availability of financing  annual budget cycles  as well as the typical reduction in upgrade projects during the winter months  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry  overall demand for broadband services  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative data transmission and access technologies  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in recent years  the cable market has been characterized by the acquisition of smaller and independent cable operators by larger operators 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that such consolidation will have on overall capital spending patterns by cable operators 
the effect on our business of further industry consolidation also is uncertain 
supply of our products depends on our ability to forecast demand accurately 
the emerging nature of the broadband services market makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast demand for our products 
our inability to forecast accurately the actual demand for our products may result in too much or too little supply of product or an over under capacity of manufacturing or testing resources at any given point in time 
the existence of any one or more of these situations could have a negative impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we had purchase obligations of approximately million as of december   primarily to purchase minimum quantities of materials and components used to manufacture our products 
we must fulfill these obligations even if demand for our products is lower than we anticipate 
our business may be affected by conditions in israel 
our operations may be affected by conditions in israel because of our significant operations there 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have continued to escalate over the past year  which could disrupt some of our operations 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel  the future of the peace efforts 
table of contents between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
a number of our employees based in israel are currently obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
we cannot assess the full impact of these requirements and the hostilities on our workforce  business or operations if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations or the hostilities 
we may have financial exposure to litigation against our directors and officers 
we are obligated to indemnify our executive officers and the members of our board of directors for certain actions taken by such officers and directors on our behalf 
in order to protect ourselves against any financial exposure resulting from the actions of our officers and directors  we purchase directors and officers insurance policies every year to cover litigation expenses and settlement awards or damage awards 
we purchase our directors and officers insurance in layers of varying amounts with a different insurance company underwriting each layer 
in october  reliance insurance co 
reliance was liquidated by the state of pennsylvania 
reliance was the underwriter for the second million layer of the first million of coverage for our directors and officers insurance for the period covering the claims made against our officers in pending securities litigation  as well as other periods 
depending upon the outcome of our current securities litigation and any future litigation that may be brought against our officers and directors  we could be liable and have to self insure the second million layer if the attorneys fees and or the settlement or damages award exceeds the first million layer 
we are dependent on key third party suppliers 
we manufacture all of our products using components or subassemblies procured from third party suppliers 
some of these components are available from a sole source and others are available from limited sources 
all of our sales are from products containing one or more components that are available only from sole source suppliers 
in addition  some of our components are custom parts produced to our specifications 
for example  we have relied and will continue to rely on sole source semiconductor manufacturers to supply us with custom asics for use in our products 
additional components  such as the radio frequency tuner and some surface acoustic wave filters  are also procured from sole source suppliers 
any interruption in the operations of vendors of sole source parts could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
we are dependent on semiconductor manufacturers and are affected by worldwide conditions in the semiconductor market 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our gross margin or operating results 
we may be unable to migrate to new semiconductor process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop products that utilize new semiconductor process technologies 
these technologies change rapidly and require us to spend significant amounts on research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of redesigning our integrated circuits using smaller geometry process technologies to improve performance and reduce costs 
the transition of our products to integrated circuits with increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
other companies have experienced difficulty in migrating to new semiconductor processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we depend on our relationship with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 

table of contents our ability to directly control product delivery schedules and product quality is dependent on third party contract manufacturers 
most of our products are assembled and tested by contract manufacturers using testing equipment that we provide 
as a result of our dependence on these contract manufacturers for assembly and testing of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products 
in addition  as manufacturing volume increases  we will need to procure and assemble additional testing equipment and provide it to our contract manufacturers 
the production and assembly of testing equipment typically requires significant lead times 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are unable to provide this testing equipment to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and communications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  trade barriers  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if our customers are affected by currency devaluations or general economic crises  such as the recent economic crises affecting many asian and latin american economies  their ability to purchase our products could be reduced significantly 
payment cycles for international customers typically are longer than those for customers in north america 
foreign countries may decide to prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new broadband services infrastructures for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns  availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the availability and cost of related equipment 
any action like this by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
while we generally invoice our foreign sales in us dollars  we do invoice our sales into brazil in reals and our sales in europe in euros 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as we expand our international operations  payments to us in foreign currencies and our exposure to losses as the result of foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
in addition  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to those foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
we may be unable to provide adequate customer support 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our broadband products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stages 
to date  our sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base 
we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
our inability to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful 
table of contents deployment of our products 
in addition  our failure to provide adequate support could harm our reputation and relationship with our customers and could prevent us from gaining new customers 
our industry is highly competitive with many established competitors 
the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change 
our direct competitors in the cable arena include cisco systems  adc  arris  juniper networks  com  motorola  nortel networks  thomson consumer electronics which markets products under the brand name rca  samsung  scientific atlanta and toshiba 
we also compete with companies that develop integrated circuits for broadband products  such as broadcom  conexant and texas instruments 
in addition  we compete with companies in the dsl arena such as alcatel  siemens  lucent  nortel networks  efficient networks  zhone  marconi  charles industries  accelerated networks and integral access 
the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product performance  features and reliability  price  size and stability of operations  breadth of product line  sales and distribution capabilities  technical support and service  relationships with providers of service providers  and compliance with industry standards 
some of these factors are outside of our control 
the existing conditions in the market for broadband services could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements 
the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete 
our competitors may introduce products that are less costly  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  customer support and other resources  as well as better name recognition and access to customers than we do 
the widespread adoption of docsis and other industry standards is likely to cause increased worldwide price competition  particularly in the north american market 
we believe that the adoption of these standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in lower sales of our proprietary s cdma products 
any increased price competition or reduction in sales of our products  particularly our higher margin headend products  would result in downward pressure on our gross margin 
these competitive pressures have and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business 
our business is dependent on the internet and the development of internet infrastructure 
our success depends on increased demand for high speed internet services for commercial use 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet remain largely unresolved and are likely to affect the development of the market for our products 
these issues include security  reliability  cost  ease of access and quality of service 
our success also will depend on the growth of the use of the internet by businesses for multimedia applications that require high bandwidth 
the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent periods of performance degradation 
this has required the upgrade of routers  telecommunications links and other components forming the infrastructure of the internet by service providers and other organizations with links to the internet 
any perceived degradation in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of our products 

table of contents we are dependent on key personnel 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we are highly dependent on the continued service of  and on the ability to attract and retain  qualified engineering  sales  marketing and senior management personnel 
the competition for some of these personnel is intense 
the loss of any of these individuals may harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to hire qualified personnel as needed  we may be unable to adequately manage and grow our business 
highly skilled employees with the education and training that we require  especially employees with significant experience and expertise in both data networking and radio frequency design  are in high demand 
we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have key person insurance coverage for the loss of any of our employees 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
our employees are not bound by non competition agreements with us 
our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products like ours are very complex and frequently contain undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite testing  errors may occur 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns and other losses to us and or our customers 
this occurrence could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale 
however  these terms and conditions may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products  but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
in addition  even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and management time and resources 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
even though we seek to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products  there are risks 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 
even if they are granted  the claims covered by the patent may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without a license from us 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with many of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
cablelabs docsis specification includes two modulation techniques  s cdma and a tdma 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs whereby we licensed to cablelabs any of our intellectual property rights to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks throughout the world 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might 
table of contents not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
our business and our customers are subject to regulation 
our business and customers are subject to varying degrees of regulation by regulatory bodies in the united states and foreign countries 
although these regulations have not materially restricted our operations to date or the operations of our customers  future regulations applicable to our business or customers could be adopted 
the adoption of future regulations may adversely affect our customers  our ability to sell our products and therefore our operating results 
our products are subject to approvals and certifications 
in the united states  our products are required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  we are required to have our products certified by underwriters laboratory in order to meet federal requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
outside the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis or at all the regulatory approvals that may be required for the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
in addition to regulatory compliance  some cable operators require that our products be certified or qualified as having met docsis or euro docsis specifications 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  power outages and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities and some manufacturing operations are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
in addition  the operations of some of our key suppliers are also located in this area and in other areas known for seismic activity  such as taiwan 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business or the operations of one or more of our key suppliers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  we may incur substantially more debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding 
this high level of indebtedness may adversely affect our stockholders by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the terms of our outstanding debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so 
if new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify
