item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general founded in  we are an it professional services firm providing business consulting  infrastructure design and implementation  managed services  business continuity planning  and security and professional development to fortune and other large and mid sized companies located primarily in the new york to philadelphia corridor 
in  the company s professional service activities and related revenues accounted for of its business 
except for the mta contract entered into in december  there are no ongoing written commitments by customers to purchase products from us and all product sales are made on a purchase order basis 
as the market for it products has matured  price competition has intensified and is likely to continue to intensify 
during and  our gross profits  margins and results of operations were adversely affected by such continued product pricing pressure and by a significant reduction in product purchase orders from our customers 
in addition  our gross profits  margins and results of operations could be adversely affected by a disruption in our sources of product supply 
in  we emphasized professional services which command higher margins than product sales 
we have entered into an arrangement which will allow us to outsource most of our product procurement business and concentrate on our core offerings in three main areas business advisory  technology implementation and managed services 
within these three areas  several new services were added in in business advisory there are two areas of specialization business consulting and enterprise technology solutions 
business consulting assesses common business processes such as security  technology assessment and economic justification  business continuity contingency planning and the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
enterprise technology solutions provide vendor specific consulting services from strategic partners such as microsoft and cisco 
in technology implementation  there are two areas of specialization infrastructure and information management services 
in  three additional services were added storage management  wireless mobile and portal services 
in connection with our managed services offerings  we have rebranded the managed services we provide to our clients 
corserv sm provides base level real time monitoring and management of essential infrastructure components 
securserv sm extends the corserv services to include firewalls and other essential security components  providing managed url filtering for traffic control 
advancesecurserv sm provides complex intrusion detection and web content protection services 
we have moved the primary functionality of these management and monitoring services to a highly secure and redundant facility 
this has enabled us to streamline our operations and reduce the costs associated with delivering these services  while at the same time significantly increasing the reliability and security of these offerings 
the competition for quality technical personnel has decreased as compared to previous years 
this is primarily due to a slow economy 
over the past few years  we embarked on a plan to shift our business model from a product reseller and integration business to a model that focuses on higher margin technology professional services 
as a result of this shift  our product sales have declined significantly 
during the fourth quarter of  management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill amounting to million related to this business was not recoverable 
although it remains our objective to shift our professional services business towards higher end business advisory  managed services and related revenues  we nevertheless currently derive approximately of our professional services business from technology implementation services  including deskside and network support help desk services and training 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in improving our penetration of the higher end technology consulting services market in the future 
in  we faced reduced manpower requirements due to an industrywide shift in it spending  including a pronounced slowdown in it spending  principally resulting from the recent economic downturn 
in  we reduced our employee population from approximately employees to employees as at december  as a result of our reduced revenue stream 
many companies reduced their it expenditures in due to the economic downturn 
this reduction adversely impacted our business  particularly our it staffing and professional services groups 
we believe that industry trends are being driven by  among other things  the internet  microsoft and the tragic events of september  these trends include enhanced demand for information security and related business continuity offerings  wireless integration and the architecture  deployment and support of microsoft s new operating systems and 
net strategy 
we are focused on delivering these newer services 
our efforts include new and enhanced partnerships with industry leaders such as microsoft  novell  cisco and computer associates and the realignment of our professional services and sales personnel towards these new business and technology services 
our cost of sales includes primarily  in the case of product sales  the cost to us of products acquired for resale and  in the case of services and support revenue  salaries and related expenses for billable technical personnel 
our selling  general and administrative costs consist of operating expenses  including personnel and related costs  such as sales commissions earned by employees involved in the sales of it products  services and support 
personnel costs also include direct sales  marketing and sales support  and general and administrative personnel costs 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
during the last three fiscal years  the gross margins earned on services and support sales  or professional services decreased from for  to for  and increased to for we believe that our ability to provide a broad range of technical services  coupled with our long term relationships with large customers  provides us with the potential to grow our professional services business 
our net sales  gross profit  operating income and net income and losses have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and are expected to do so in the future 
many factors  some of which are not within our control  have contributed and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include the short term nature of our customers commitments  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing  size  and mix of product and service orders and deliveries  the timing and size of new projects  o pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  market factors affecting the availability of qualified technical personnel  timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings  changes in trends affecting outsourcing of it services  disruption in sources of supply  changes in product  personnel  and other operating costs  and industry and general economic conditions 
operating results have been and may in the future also be affected by the cost  timing and other effects of acquisitions  including the mix of revenues of acquired companies 
therefore  you should not rely upon past operating results and period to period comparisons as an indication of future operating performance 
our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by changes in technical personnel billing and utilization rates 
many of our costs  particularly costs associated with services and support revenue  such as administrative support personnel and facilities costs  are primarily fixed costs 
our overall expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
our company makes certain judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements 
our company s most significant accounting estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable  inventory valuation  rebate accruals  the realizability of the mta contract costs  the realizability of deferred tax assets  and the amortization period and carrying value of intangibles 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of products when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which takes place either when the products are shipped or upon delivery to the customer based upon the sales terms of the respective transactions 
under the arrangement with moredirect  we do not recognize sales of product to our customers  we receive an agency fee associated with such sales from moredirect 
consulting and other services and support revenue is recognized when the applicable services are rendered 
we recognize revenue on service contracts on a prorated basis over the life of the contracts 
revenues under the metropolitan transit authority contract the mta contract are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on total costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
prepaid fees related to the company s training programs are deferred and amortized to income over the duration of the applicable training program 
deferred revenue is included in accrued expenses and represents the unearned portion of each service contract and the unamortized balance of prepaid training fees received as of the balance sheet date 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a weighted average basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down our inventory for estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  industry or product technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of intangibles and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on current and estimated future profitability and undiscounted cash flows 
as a result of the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   goodwill will no longer be amortized to the income statement 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and an annual impairment review thereafter 
as a result of our initial impairment review  we do not believe that any impairment charge is required 
however  there can be no assurance that a material impairment charge will not be required as a result of future annual reviews 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires use of the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
the reduction in the valuation allowance could have a material positive affect on our net results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  our effective tax rate would likely increase significantly in periods subsequent to the initial reversal of the valuation allowance 
accounts receivable and rebates we regularly review the collectibility of accounts receivable and rebates due from clients and vendors  respectively 
we make estimates of expected realization of these assets 
there can be no assurance that additional charges will not be required as a result of future reviews 
mta contract in december  we entered into a four year  million contract with the metropolitan transportation authority of new york to furnish and install local and wide area computer network components including network and telecommunications hardware  software and cabling throughout the mta s over locations 
the aggregate amount of this contract was subsequently increased to million 
we are the prime contractor on this project and are responsible for project management  systems procurement  and installation 
the work is grouped in contiguous locations and payment is predicated upon achieving specific milestone events 
in the event of default  in addition to all other remedies at law  the mta reserves the right to terminate our services and complete the mta contract itself at our cost 
in the event of unexcused delay by us  we may be obligated to pay  as liquidated damages  the sum of to per day  per site 
while we are currently performing in accordance with the contract terms  there can be no assurance that any such events of default or unexcused delays will not occur 
in addition  the mta contract is a fixed unit price contract  and the quantities are approximate  for which the mta has expressly reserved the right  for each item  to direct the amount of equipment be increased  decreased  or omitted entirely on days notice 
the mta has the right to suspend the work on days notice for up to days and or terminate the contract  at any time  on notice  paying only for the work performed to the date of termination 
the project is subject to the prevailing wage rate and classification for telecommunications workers  managed by the new york city controller s office  over which our company has no control  and which is generally adjusted in june of each year and may be so adjusted in the future 
we have performed services and supplied products to the mta since the inception of the mta contract 
the work performed to date at mta sites has required greater than originally estimated labor and other costs to complete 
in may  we submitted a formal request to the mta for equitable adjustment in the amount of approximately million and for a time extension 
this request was supplemented with a further submission in october in january  the project manager for the mta contract denied our request  thereby triggering our right under the contract to appeal the project manager s denial to the mta s dispute resolution office the dro 
we filed our notice of appeal with the dro in february  and pursuant to the dro s request  filed further written submissions and participated in an arbitral session with the dro subsequent thereto 
in november  the dro rendered a written decision denying in full our request for equitable adjustment and time extension 
pursuant to the terms of the mta contract  in march  we appealed the dro s denial of our request to the new york supreme court 
the court has not yet ruled on our appeal 
on july   the mta advised us of a determination by the bureau of labor law hereinafter  the bureau of the new york city comptroller s office  communicated to the mta by letter from the bureau dated june   that  as of july   the labor classification for all low voltage cabling carrying voice  data  video or any combination thereof is electrician 
the bureau s determination is based on a new york state supreme court appellate division decision dated may  the workers currently and historically used by us to perform cabling work have been classified as telecommunications workers 
we believe it is probable that the bureau s determination will apply to our cabling activities under the contract  thereby likely requiring the reclassification of its telecommunications workers as electricians retroactive to july  since the prevailing wage for electricians is substantially higher than that for telecommunications workers  we expect to incur materially increased labor costs as a result of the bureau s determination 
on october   the mta project manager denied our request for a change order to compensate us for the increased costs it expects to incur in connection with the reclassification of certain of its telecommunications workers as electricians 
on january   we initiated a dispute within the meaning of the applicable federal regulations governing the mta contract by filing a complaint with the united states department of labor 
in its complaint  we request that the department of labor adjudicate this dispute  and either issue a determination affirming that the prevailing wage rate for telecommunications workers  as originally specified by the mta  is the applicable rate for this project  or directing the mta to compensate us for the change in wage classification made during the performance of the contract in violation of federal regulations 
by letter dated march   the department of labor advised us that  without knowing which  if any  federal wage decision was included in the mta contract  it is unable to make a determination that any violation of federal labor law has occurred 
on february   we were informally advised by the department of labor that the department has concluded that no federal wage determinations were included or required to be included in the mta contract because the project has insufficient federal funding to trigger the federal wage regulations 
the department of labor asserts that our claim is not one that is governed by federal regulations or one over which the department is willing to exercise jurisdiction 
we are currently awaiting a formal response from the department to this effect and will decide upon appropriate action after review of such response 
there can be no assurance we will be successful  in whole or in part  in our efforts 
in the second quarter of  our company recognized a loss of million for costs estimated to be in excess of the mta contract value 
for the years ended december  and  revenues recorded in connection with the mta contract amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   our company recognized no gross margin on such revenue 
moredirect  inc during the fourth quarter of  we initiated an effort to undertake a fundamental change in dealing with client product requirements 
this effort was finalized in january  and we signed an agreement with moredirect  inc  a leading web enabled solution provider for the procurement of corporate it products  whereby moredirect will provide product related procurement services to our clients and we will receive an agency fee on such sales from moredirect 
the arrangement provides that moredirect will bill our clients and assume product and the customer receivable risk  and that moredirect will deal directly with our clients 
eds  llc in august  we agreed that certain of our employees could join eds  llc in connection with the selection of eds  llc as a provider of help desk services previously provided by us to one of our customers 
we received a one time payment of  which we recorded as other income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this transaction  we have incurred monthly reductions of revenue and operating income from this customer of  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in replacing this revenue or operating income with business from this or other customers in the foreseeable future 
icm education division of computer horizons corp 
in september  we acquired certain of the assets of the icm education division of computer horizons corp  a premier provider of vendor authorized technical and private training services for corporations  financial institutions  governmental agencies and professional services firms in the tri state region for  we do not deem the acquisition of icm education division to be material

risk factors we offer business consulting  infrastructure design  managed services  business continuity planning  and security 
we also offer enterprise solutions including remote network management and call center support  as well as professional development 
services revenue is recognized as such services are performed 
most of our services are billed on a time and materials basis 
our professional development and services are fee based on a per course basis 
generally  our service arrangements with our customers may be terminated by such customers with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
the most significant cost relating to the services component of our business is personnel costs which consist of salaries  benefits  payroll related expenses and training and recruiting costs 
thus  the financial performance of our service business is based primarily upon billing margins billable hourly rates less the cost to us of such service personnel on an hourly basis and utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
in  we embarked on an effort to reposition ourselves from a value added reseller to a professional services company 
the competition for low margin technology products increased significantly and  more recently  the demand for technology products has declined 
as a result  we have been attempting to transition to selling higher margin services  some of which are related to technology product orders 
during this period  we have been selective in accepting product offers 
as such  during this period our products sales have declined from million in to million in our professional service revenues declined from million in  to million in  and have further declined to million in in the fourth quarter of  our most recent quarter  our professional service revenues further declined to million in the quarter  or an annual rate of million 
from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we have operated at a loss 
in january  we entered into an agency agreement with moredirect  inc  an internet based  business to business electronic marketplace which enables information technology buyers to efficiently source  evaluate  purchase and track a wide variety of computer hardware  software and related technology products 
this agreement will permit us to further exit the product business and concentrate on our core professional service offerings 
certain of our professional service offerings are dependent on technology product purchases by our existing and prospective clients  irrespective of how such clients procure their products 
accordingly  the downturn in technology spending has adversely impacted our professional service revenues 
further  competition by larger firms such as siemens  eds and ibm global services in such areas as desktop support and integration services has resulted in significant reductions in the services we provide to certain of our key customers 
we have been unable to secure sufficient new projects to offset this decline and  accordingly  our professional service revenues have declined 
there can be no assurance these negative trends will not continue 
portions of our professional service revenue are derived from fixed fee projects  under which we assume greater financial risk if we fail to accurately estimate the costs of projects 
we assume greater risk on fixed fee projects than on time and material projects 
if a miscalculation for resources or time occurs on fixed fee projects  the costs of completing these projects may exceed the price  which could result in a loss on the project and a decrease in net income 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee projects based on our estimate of the percentage of each project completed in a reporting period 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system  and there has been substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in management  general trends in the industry  recommendations by industry analysts  and other events or factors 
in addition  the equity markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of our common stock  as well as the stock of many technology companies 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected

under the facility  we were permitted to borrow  subject to certain post closing conditions and covenants  i for working capital purposes at the bank s prime rate less or libor plus and ii for acquisitions at the bank s prime rate less or libor plus 
our obligations under such facility were collateralized by a first priority lien on our accounts receivable and inventory  except for inventory for which the bank subordinated its position to certain other lenders pursuant to intercreditor agreements
