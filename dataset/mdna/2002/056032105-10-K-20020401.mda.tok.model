critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of those accounting policies that the company deems to be critical that is  they are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they reflect management s reliance on estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition on long term agreements the company regularly enters into sales transactions projects that take longer than the normal business cycle to complete 
the company accounts for these projects on a percentage completion basis 
using this method  revenues are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to the project s total estimated costs 
to the extent that the company s estimates regarding costs or time required for completion prove to be materially inaccurate  the company s revenues for a period may likewise be materially different 
the company routinely reviews estimates relating to these projects  and regularly revises the estimates when necessary to reflect a change in outlook 
revisions to cost estimates result in a charge to revenues for the period in which the facts leading to the revision become known 
adjustments to revenues based on revisions to estimates under long term agreements were insignificant for each of the three years ending december  for more information on the company s general revenue recognition policies  please see note to the financial statements included in this report 
inventory valuation the company s inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company determines the cost of inventory based on the first in  first out method fifo 
the company regularly reviews the quantity of inventories on hand and compares these quantities to the expected usage of each applicable product or product line 
the company s inventories are regularly adjusted in value to the lower of costs and or net realizable value 
since the value of the company s inventories depends in part on the company s estimates of each product s net realizable value  adjustments may be needed to reflect changes in valuation 
any adjustments the company is required to make to lower the value of the inventories are recorded as a charge to cost of revenue
