item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company currently has four operating segments diagnostics  biotech  laboratory instrumentation and pressure cycling technology  pct 
two of these  diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation primarily manufacture products 
within diagnostics there are three major product lines quality control panels  accurun r run controls  and diagnostic components 
the remaining two segments generate primarily service revenue and consist of biotech  and pct research and development 
within biotech there are four major product lines contract research  repository services  specialty reagents and research services 
revenue in the pct segment consists of both private and national institutes of health nih funded support for the research activities associated with our pressure cycling technology 
there was also nih funding in for the company s former drug discovery operations which were spun off as an independent company in november see note of notes to financial statements for a further discussion of the activities of these segments and note of notes to financial statements relative to the company s discontinued clinical laboratory operations 
effective january  all of the company s technology related to its drug discovery and vaccine programs  consisting primarily of patents and related sponsored research agreements  were transferred to panacos pharmaceuticals  inc panacos  a wholly owned subsidiary that the company formed in october in november and in february  panacos sold equity to third party investors  reducing the company s ownership to approximately which is held in non voting preferred stock 
as a result  the company no longer consolidates the results of panacos 
as of november  the company s investment in panacos was zero and the company is no longer required to fund panacos s operations 
therefore no further losses of panacos will be recorded by the company 
the company believes that this will position panacos to progress to more advanced stages of drug development including clinical trials  while at the same time allowing management to focus more time on the company s core business 
in december  the company made a decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing services segment and in february  bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sold the business and certain assets and liabilities to a third party for an adjusted purchase price of  the escrow account was terminated in december by mutual agreement between the buyer and the company  resulting of approximately  being received by the company from the escrow account 
the company has retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl  primarily property  plant and equipment  together with the facility lease subsequent to the closing date  which the company is attempting to sublease 
the company has written down all of the retained assets not otherwise redistributed to other business units to their estimated net realizable value 
the company recorded an after tax gain of  in the remaining estimate of closing costs included an estimate of costs associated with disposing of all remaining assets and retiring all existing liabilities including a facility lease 
the company will utilize in year certain prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company  to partially offset the tax effect of this gain 
in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company operated the business in a normal fashion from the date of closing to december  during which substantially all costs associated with operation of the business subsequent to the closing date were borne by the purchaser 
products the economics and cost structures of the segments have certain differences 
the diagnostics segment has historically been the largest and most profitable segment  both in absolute dollars and in operating profit margin  as it operates primarily in a commercial environment with fewer competitors and relatively short product development cycles 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had been in decline for several years prior to its acquisition in mid  and management is working to turn around this business 
it also operates in a highly competitive  low margin business contract manufacturing of instruments and medical devices 
at the current low annual revenue level of less than million  it operates significantly under capacity with high fixed overhead costs  and should therefore significantly benefit from relatively small revenue increases 
services bbi biotech has been project oriented with a high proportion of its revenue generated from government contracts for both research and service activities and assisting the other segments in their new product and service development 
it has the highest level of inter segment activity  and is structured around project tracking of direct costs plus overhead  general and administrative costs and a low percentage fee 
its financial goal has been to breakeven  prior to the allocation of corporate overhead while contributing to the development of future products and services for the company 
the pct segment s r d operation does not currently have any product or service revenue  but expects to launch its first products in revenue to date consists of both private and public nih funding of segment research 
most of the expenditures by this segment are for r d expenses  patent costs and general management expenses 

the company continues to seek funding from both private and public sources to minimize the impact of their development costs on the company s overall operating results 
panacos pharmaceuticals obtained independent third party equity financing in november thus terminating the company s responsibility going forward to fund future research and development activities of panacos 
in february  panacos raised million in additional equity thereby diluting the company s interest in non voting preferred shares of panacos to quarterly fluctuations historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures 
in particular  in the diagnostics segment  the company s sales of its off the shelf quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas oem product sales may peak in any quarter of the year  depending on the production cycle of a given project 
in the company s biotech segment  research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result these contracts can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
neither the laboratory instrumentation segment nor the pct segment is subject to material seasonal variations 
research and development with the acquisition of bioseq  inc and its pressure cycling technology in september as well as the hiring of a vice president for the drug discovery and development program which evolved into panacos pharmaceuticals  inc in  the company has expended significant amounts for ongoing research and development spending on new technologies in pct and panacos only 
in the past three years  the company s bioseq research subsidiary has incurred approximately m of research and development expenses substantially related to development of a unique instrument and disposable specimen processing tube in conjunction with pct 
the company has received eight patents for this technology and intends to have commercial products  using this technology  available for sale in year in addition to ongoing development of new accurun products the company has also incurred development costs on reagent purification projects 
research and development expenses incurred in year also include approximately  related to panacos pharmaceuticals drug discovery and development program 
export sales he company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
percentages 
gif 
years ended december  and revenue total revenue from continuing operations increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of an increase in product revenue of  or  to  in from  in  coupled with an increase in service revenue of  or  to  in from  in product revenue 
the product revenue increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of basematrix and characterized specimens to ivd test kit manufacturers and continued strong domestic sales of accurun controls in the diagnostics segment 
service revenue 
the biotech segment experienced a significant increase in repository and research services revenue 
in addition  service revenue recognized in year also included  of funding received by panacos for drug discovery activities  as noted above  the company no longer consolidates the results of operations of panacos 
gross profit overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  for year product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  for  product gross margin increased to in from in services gross profit increased  to  in from  for and service gross margin increased to in from in product gross margin 
the increase in product gross margin at the diagnostics segment  was derived from increased sales of higher margin catalog products coupled with a higher level of sales 
this was coupled with a gross margin increase at the laboratory instrumentation segment driven by the cost reduction plan implemented in september in year  the company recorded charges for inventory valuation at both of these segments  thereby lowering gross margins 
service gross margin 
the increase in service gross margin was due to an increase in higher margin commercial services as well as increased repository revenue  both performed at the biotech segment 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased  or  to  in from  in the year included  of research and development expenses associated with panacos  the results of which are no longer included in the company s results of operation as discussed above 
exclusive of funding to panacos in  research and development expenses increased  in most of which was driven by higher research and development spending on the company s pct program activities 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase was a result of filling several sales and marketing positions in the latter part of as well as increased travel and promotion costs at the diagnostic segment 
general and administrative general and administrative costs declined  or  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily a result of several factors 
first  there were headcount reductions at corporate  and the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments in the latter part of year and into year second  there was a significantly lower level of professional fees in compared to  when the company explored several strategic and financing options  also in  the company reversed  of expenses previously accrued in year  based on the june legal settlement reached with paradigm group  llc  as discussed further in the accompanying footnotes to the financial statements 
finally  a portion of the decline was associated with the september write down of goodwill at the laboratory instrumentation segment  thereby reducing amortization expense in year by  compared to the year impairment of intangible asset as part of an ongoing strategic review process  the company s board of directors met in late september to review the progress of its laboratory instrumentation segment  and that segment s prospects for the future to determine if any impairment of the segment s goodwill had occurred 
based on information presented at that meeting and subsequent analyses showing lower revenue expectations  management approved a cost reduction plan including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
using the lower revenue projections associated with this plan  the laboratory instrumentation segment s undiscounted future cash flows were projected to be less than the carrying value of that segment s goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  this segment s goodwill was written down by approximately  in the third quarter of operating income loss operating loss from continuing operations decreased to  in versus  in the diagnostics segment s operating income increased to  in from  in  due to an increase in product revenue coupled with an increase in product gross margin  partially offset by an increased absorption of corporate overhead by this segment as explained further hereunder 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for versus a loss for of  year results of operation include a charge of  taken in the third quarter of related to impairment of intangible assets as discussed further above  whereas year operating results reflect the impact of the september cost reduction plan 
the pct segment had an operating loss of  in as compared to an operating loss of  in year  also in year  panacos incurred a  pre tax operating loss  the company no longer consolidates the results of operation of panacos subsequent to november as previously discussed 
effective january  the company adjusted its allocation of corporate overhead based upon a revised corporate structure effective in the present corporate structure reflects the company s implementation  in the latter part of  of a cost reduction plan at the laboratory instrumentation segment  the company s spin off of panacos as an independent company  and the company s decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing business 
the latter item is reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company ceased allocating corporate overhead to the clinical laboratory testing business for all periods presented 
this adjustment results in the diagnostics unit absorbing a large portion of corporate overhead  which in prior years would have been allocated to panacos and the clinical laboratory testing business 
interest expense cumulative change in accounting principle interest expense decreased from  in to  in the large portion of the decrease is associated with reduced interest expense incurred in on the company s line of credit  which was outstanding for all of but was repaid and terminated by the company in february as discussed further in the section discontinued operations hereunder 
additional interest expense was incurred in the year associated with the company obtaining a  net mortgage on its west bridgewater ma facility in april in year  the company incurred a charge of  including  for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  the company redeemed the remaining  face value of outstanding senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures plus accrued interest and a premium of  which was charged to interest expense 
the pro rata portion of unamortized original issue discount  debt issuance and warrant related costs associated with the redeemed debentures  amounting to approximately  is included in the loss on extinguishment of the debentures 
substantially offsetting this loss is the company s reversal of approximately  of interest expense in year  previously recorded in  associated with the amortization of the debentures beneficial conversion feature 
income taxes in the third quarter of  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and in consideration of three consecutive years of losses  accordingly  the company has not subsequently recognized an income tax benefit associated with the loss from continuing operations in either year nor as these tax assets have been fully reserved for 
the company has recorded approximately  of state tax expense in year loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for year  as a result of the items discussed above 
discontinued operations on february   the company sold the business and certain assets and liabilities of its wholly owned subsidiary bbicl to a third party for an adjusted purchase price of  the escrow account was terminated in december by mutual agreement between the buyer and the company  resulting in approximately  being received by the company from the escrow account 
the company has retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl  primarily property  plant and equipment  together with the facility lease subsequent to the closing date  which the company is attempting to sublease 
the company has written down all of the retained assets not otherwise redistributed to other business units to their estimated net realizable value 
the company has recorded a gain of  net of taxes of  in the company expects to utilize prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company  to partially offset the tax effect of this gain 
additionally  the company has taken a tax benefit of approximately  related to stock option exercises that was not previously recorded as the company was in a loss position 
this tax benefit was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital in the company has recorded its estimate of remaining short and long term accrued liabilities to exit the clinical laboratory testing business  totaling approximately  as of december  the major components of this accrual are estimated income taxes  severance and other employee related costs  estimated lease exit and facility related costs  and potential health care claims and other related potential audit adjustments  with the remainder for other miscellaneous costs associated with exiting this business segment 
revenues from discontinued operations  net of intercompany eliminations  were  for the period from january  to february  and  for the year ended december  operating losses from discontinued operations were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in summary  income loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company operated the business in a normal fashion during the period february  through december all of the revenues generated by  and substantially all costs associated with operating the business subsequent to the closing date of the transaction are the responsibility of the purchaser 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to redeem all outstanding debentures and to retire the company s line of credit in the first quarter of summary in summary  the company had net income of  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this improvement was driven by four factors first and foremost  the gain recognized on the sale of the company s clinical laboratory business  secondly  a significantly reduced operating loss in compared to as all business units posted improved operating results  and panacos which incurred a pretax loss of  in no longer being consolidated in  thirdly  the impairment of intangible assets at the laboratory instrumentation segment recorded in  which increased the loss for  and fourthly  higher interest expense in due to the higher debt carried prior to the repayments that occurred after the sale of the clinical laboratory business 
the earnings per share computation for reflects both the issuance of  additional shares of common stock in the first quarter of  as certain holders of the debentures exercised their rights to convert  of such debentures into shares of the company s common stock  and the issuance of  additional shares of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  on june   the company and paradigm group  llc entered into an agreement to permanently settle their disputes 
under the terms of the agreement  paradigm group  llc rescinded their exercise of the common stock purchase warrants  which have since expired  and the company retained the  shares associated with their exercise 
these shares were included in the total shares outstanding as well as in the calculation of earnings loss per share from february  the date of exercise through june  the date of the agreement 
as of september  these shares were cancelled by the company 
in december  an additional  shares of common stock were subscribed to and paid for by a group of investors for  these shares were issued in the first quarter of and therefore were not included in the total shares outstanding as well as in the calculation of earnings loss per share for the year ended december  years ended december  and revenue total revenue from continuing operations decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease in revenue was the result of a decrease in product revenue of or  to  in from  in  partially offset by an increase in service revenue of or  to  in from  in product revenue 
the product revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a  decrease in the diagnostics segment and a  decrease in the laboratory instrumentation segment 
the diagnostics decrease was the result of a reduced level of sales of its oem and seroconversion panels  and basematrix as the consolidation within the in vitro diagnostic industry has negatively affected demand for these products 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in accurun r and characterized disease state blood product sales 
the laboratory instrumentation segment revenue decreased due to a lower level of contract manufacturing due to the timing of an order from a large customer and another customer experiencing financial difficulty causing them to place their order on hold 
the company believes the negative effects of industry consolidation are mostly behind it and that there are growth opportunities within both its existing business as well as providing products for rapid test and chip based technologies 
service revenue 
the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to increases of  from the diagnostics segment   from the biotech segment and  in the panacos segment 
the growth in diagnostics was related to increased service work for in vitro diagnostic manufacturers including plasma inactivations 
the biotech segment s growth was due to new government contracts for both its repository and research services 
the panacos and pct segments growth was a result of funding received from both the nih and the consortium for plasma science  which partially defrayed the cost of pressure cycling technology development and certain other drug discovery activities associated with panacos 
gross profit overall gross profit decreased  or  to  in the year ended december  from  for product gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  for and product gross margin decreased to in  from in services gross profit increased  to  in from  for and service gross margin increased to in  from in product gross margin 
the decrease in product gross margin was due substantially to a decrease in the gross margin of the laboratory instrumentation operating segment 
this decrease was due to a lower level of sales activity  resulting in underutilized capacity and excess overhead costs 
in addition  the company adjusted the inventory valuations for both this segment and the diagnostic segment in year service gross margin 
the increase in service gross margin was due to small increases in both the diagnostics and the panacos and pct segments  which were partially offset by a lower service gross margin from the biotech segment due to an increase in low margin government contracts 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in the company continued to emphasize development efforts within the pct and panacos business segments  the latter being included during the period january  to november  as discussed further hereunder 
research and development expenditures at these segments were approximately flat 
however there was a decrease in spending at the laboratory instrumentation segment as the platemate program was discontinued in september in addition  there was a decrease in spending at biotech in order to meet contract schedules 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in this decrease was a result of a slight reduction in promotion and travel costs  and vacancies in several key positions at the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments 
some of these positions were filled early in the third quarter of general and administrative general and administrative costs increased  or  to  for from  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in professional consulting services associated with the company s various financing and strategic transactions and options in additionally   of general and administrative personnel related expenses incurred in were capitalized as part of the erp system implementation in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company completed the project in november  therefore  no additional costs were capitalized in impairment of intangible asset as part of an ongoing strategic review process  the company s board of directors met in september to review the progress of its laboratory instrumentation segment  and that segment s prospects for the future to determine if any impairment of the segment s goodwill had occurred 
based on information presented at that meeting and subsequent analyses showing lower revenue expectations  management approved a cost reduction plan including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
using the lower revenue projections associated with this plan  the laboratory instrumentation segment s undiscounted future cash flows were projected to be less than the carrying value of that segment s goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of both accounting principles board opinion no

accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  this segment s goodwill was written down by approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal year operating loss consolidated loss from continuing operations increased to  in versus a  loss in the diagnostics segment s operating income decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreased revenue and the beneficial effect on s operating income of capitalizing certain employee salaries associated with the erp system implementation 
the biotech segment s operating loss decreased to  in from  in  due to increased revenue from government contracts 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for versus a loss for of  the year loss includes a write down of approximately of their goodwill as of the previous balance sheet date 
excluding this  the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for as a result of continued low levels of revenue 
at the end of the third quarter of  management approved a cost reduction plan in the laboratory instrumentation segment including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
the operating loss of the pct and panacos segments combined increased to  in from  in due to planned research and development and patent related costs 
the company continued to invest heavily in the areas of pressure cycling technology and the drug discovery program  through its subsidiary bbi bioseq and its investment in panacos pharmaceuticals 
the company s ownership of panacos was reduced to in the fourth quarter of as a result of panacos obtaining additional equity financing from new investors 
accordingly  the company terminated consolidation accounting subsequent to november  the company had recorded panacos s pre tax operating losses for the period january  to november  in the amount of approximately  interest expense cumulative change in accounting principle interest expense increased from  in to  in throughout the year  the company carried a higher average debt balance and interest rate on its line of credit than in additional interest expense was incurred in associated with the company obtaining a new  mortgage on its west bridgewater ma facility  effective april in addition  the company incurred a charge of  including  for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements due to amortization of the beneficial conversion feature  warrant costs and original issue discount debt issuance costs associated with the company s august issuance of  senior subordinated convertible debentures

discontinued operations the clinical laboratory services segment  a discontinued operation  had an operating loss of  in versus income of  for due to both a lower volume of molecular testing as several customers began performing these tests in house in  and competitive pricing pressure in molecular testing  resulting in lower gross margin 
summary the company had a net loss of  in as compared to a net loss of  in as a result of the operating loss  interest expense associated with the august issuance of  of debentures  the impairment of an intangible asset at the laboratory instrument segment  and the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as described above 
liquidity and financial condition as of december   the company had existing cash balances of approximately  compared with  at december  the company s working capital position increased to  as of december  from  as of december  these improvements in both ending cash and working capital position were the result of utilizing proceeds generated by the sale of the clinical laboratory business in february as discussed above thereby enabling the company to pay off a substantial portion of its debt  as further discussed below 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the year ended december  the improvement in cash used in operations during is primarily associated with the decreased loss from continuing operations and the collection of an income tax refund in the first quarter of net cash used in investing activities was  in versus  in the comparable prior year period 
during  the company s bbi biotech segment invested  to build out its new repository facility in frederick  maryland

the company s board of directors and  with respect to the decision to pledge the  cash collateral  a special committee of the independent directors  evaluated a number of alternatives and concluded that the original loan to the ceo and the subsequent pledge were the best alternative and in the best interests of the company s stockholders because it would  among other things  avoid selling pressure on the company s common stock and relieve the financial pressures on the ceo that could otherwise divert his attention from the company 
in april  the company borrowed  net of issuance costs under a mortgage agreement on its west bridgewater  ma facility 
the company used these funds to reduce the outstanding balance on its line of credit 
the mortgage is due on march  during the first five years the note carries an interest rate of  after five years the rate charged will be greater than the bank base rate then in effect 
under this mortgage agreement the company is subject to certain financial covenants
