the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
the company records impairment losses and reduces the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where the company does not expect to recover its carrying costs on properties held for use  the company reduces its carrying cost to fair value  and for properties held for sale  the company reduces its carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the year ended december   an impairment loss of million was recognized related to a property sold subsequent to december  additionally  an impairment loss of million was recognized related to a shopping center that was held for sale as of december  management does not believe that the value of the remaining properties held for sale or properties in use are impaired as of december  bad debts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to the company s mortgage debt 
currently  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt  interest rate swap agreements and libor caps 
as of december   the company had total mortgage debt of million of which million  or  was fixed rate and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads

in addition  million of notional variable rate principal is hedged through the use of libor caps as of december  the company also has two interest rate swaps hedging the company s exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of libor based variable rate debt related to its investment in crossroads 
of the company s total outstanding debt  million will become due by as the company intends on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates which may be greater than the current interest rate  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately  annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
furthermore  interest expense on the company s variable debt as of december  would increase by million annually for a basis point increase in interest rates 
the company may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  the company would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means
