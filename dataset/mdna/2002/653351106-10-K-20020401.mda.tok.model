item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
european operations through sila we address the needs of business customers abroad through sila communications  ltd  our joint venture with reuters in which we hold a equity interest 
sila currently targets major corporations throughout europe who seek to extend their applications to handheld devices  as well as wireless carriers seeking to outsource wireless data services 
sila  headquartered in london  provides wireless system hosting and end user support primarily to financial services customers via various wireless networks from the european countries of the united kingdom  sweden and spain and the region of benelux 
we received a interest in sila in exchange for million in cash plus of the equity interests of ifx  a company we purchased in april for million 
reuters holds of the equity interests of sila  which it received in exchange for approximately million in cash plus contribution of all of its rights to futures pager limited  a european paging company 
under a marketing and strategic agreement with sila and reuters  we have agreed to give sila sales leads and to assist its sale of our products 
the agreement also gives sila the right to a non exclusive license to use our technology and requires sila to give us an opportunity to sell its products 
for as long as we continue to own a greater than equity interest in sila  we have the right to appoint four directors to its seven director board 
david s 
oros  chairman of sila  also serves as a director  chairman and chief executive officer of aether 
strategic relationships we believe that partnerships are critical to the success of the company and vital to our growth 
the partnerships we have created include joint development relationships where we are working together with firms to develop products and or next generation technologies to address specific vertical market opportunities 
we also have worked with various suppliers at the platform and application level in original equipment manufacturer oem relationships to embed technologies from suppliers in aether fusiontm 
similarly  other hardware and software manufacturers have chosen to extend their application by imbedding our technology  aether fusiontm 
finally  we have distribution partnerships where we can gain the marketing capacity of other firms with greater market presence in markets than we have today 
distribution service we entered into an agreement with cap gemini ernst young cge y in may to develop  market  and deliver mobile and wireless solutions in north america 
cge y has provided a demonstration center featuring our products  and has educated and trained consultants to deliver our solutions worldwide 
under the agreement  cge y has agreed to promote our products in connection with its provision of consulting services and we have agreed to license use of aether fusion by cge y in providing services to its consulting clients 
wireless network carriers we believe our relationships with wireless network carriers are mutually beneficial 
we believe we are among the largest buyers of wireless data network capacity for many of the carriers we use 
as a result  we are able to negotiate favorable rates 
typically  we have one year contracts to buy data network capacity either for an agreed amount of kilobytes at a flat fee or on a cents per kilobyte basis 
we have contracts with wireless carriers including verizon wireless  at t wireless  cingular wireless  and motient 
as a result  we can give our customers a wide variety of wireless carrier choices 
hardware and software vendors our services increase the usefulness of wireless handheld devices  and we believe our solutions will increase sales of these devices 
we have therefore entered into a number of arrangements with mobile device manufacturers  including the following in february   we announced a strategic partnership with symbol technologies  inc  to offer our wireless data systems and services with symbol handheld devices 
in december  we entered a partnership with sharp to develop a wireless e mail solution based on aether fusion for the new sharp zaurus device 
the device will carry the unwired by aether branding 
the initial phase of deployment will provide an isp pop and imap formats e mail service targeted to what sharp terms the pro sumer 
this service is expected to be launched in the first half of the second phase of deployment is an aether developed wireless e mail solution for the corporate user with more stringent security microsoft exchange and lotus notes back ends 
we are providing all the wireless integration for both today s and tomorrow s networks 
in april  we entered into a strategic agreement with research in motion rim to market and sell rim wireless devices 
competition the market for our solutions is competitive 
we believe we offer the broadest range of applications and services to businesses necessary to enable the development  offering and ongoing support of wireless data communication systems for their employees and customers 
the widespread adoption of industry standards may make it easier for new market entrants to offer some or all of the services we offer and may make it easier for existing competitors to introduce some or all of the applications and services they do not now provide  or improve the quality of their services 
we expect that we will compete primarily on the basis of the functionality  breadth  quality and price of our services 
our current and potential competitors include wireless systems integrators and database vendors  including ibm  oracle  and eds 
mobile and or wireless software companies  including openwave systems  comverse technology  inc  avantgo  inc  extended systems  inc  and puma technology  inc  everypath  inc  and brience  inc wireless data services providers  such as solutions inc and goamerica  inc wireless network carriers  such as verizon wireless  at t wireless  cingular wireless  sprint pcs group  and nextel communications  inc some of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
in the category of wireless network carriers  some of these companies may also sell us airtime for our solutions 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 
notwithstanding the competitiveness of our market  we believe that our potential competitors face substantial barriers to market entry 
development of wireless data systems comparable to those we have already developed is time consuming and costly 
intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark  patent  copyright  service mark  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
we have applied for various trademarks and patents 
the following trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office scoutsync  cerulean  cerulean design  packetcluster  packetcluster patrol  packetwriter  mobilemax  advantage 
the following trademarks have been published or allowed by the united states patent and trademark office aether  aether systems  aether design  unwired by aether  scoutbuilder  scoutit  scoutweb  scoutextend  mobile finance by aether  aether airlead  aether attache  aether smart agent  mobilefusion  mobilefusion design  safestop  information for a wireless world  pocketinvestigator  pro there can be no assurances that our applications will be granted or that holders of other trademarks will not claim that the published or allowed trademarks  or other aether pending trademark applications  infringe their trademarks 
we have received notices of allowance for two of our patents while the remainder are pending 
there is no assurance that the patent applications will result in patents being issued by the united states patent and trademark office or other foreign patent offices  nor is there any guarantee that any issued patent will be valid and enforceable 
other companies may independently develop or otherwise acquire similar technology or gain access to our proprietary technology 
despite our precautions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our technology from competitors in the future 
the enforcement of patent rights often requires the institution of litigation against infringers 
this litigation is often costly and time consuming 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others  even though we take steps to assure that neither our employees nor our contractors knowingly incorporate unlicensed copyrights or trade secrets into our products 
it is possible that third parties may claim that our products and services may infringe upon their trademark  patent  copyright  or trade secret rights 
any such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  expensive  cause delays in introducing new or improved products or services  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or require us to stop using the challenged intellectual property 
successful infringement claims against us may materially disrupt the conduct of our business or affect profitability 
there are currently no legal proceedings or claims for infringement of intellectual property rights pending against us 
government regulation we are not currently subject to direct federal  state or local government regulation  other than regulations that apply to businesses generally 
the wireless network carriers we contract with to provide airtime and some of our hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission 
changes in fcc regulations could affect the availability of wireless coverage these carriers are willing or able to sell to us 
we could also be adversely affected by developments in regulations that govern or may in the future govern the internet  the allocation of radio frequencies or the placement of cellular towers 
regulations of the sec governing online trading could reduce the level of online trading or the demand for wireless financial information 
also  changes in these regulations could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased service delivery cost or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not collect sales or other taxes with respect to the sale of services or products in states and countries where we believe we are not required to do so 
we do collect sales and other taxes in the states in which we have offices and are required by law to do so 
some jurisdictions have sought to impose sales or other tax obligations on companies that engage in online commerce within their jurisdictions 
a successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we should collect sales or other taxes on our products and services  or remit payment of sales or other taxes for prior periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any new legislation or regulation  or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  could have an adverse effect on our business 
employees as of december   we and our wholly owned subsidiaries had a total of approximately employees  excluding employees of sila  and of these employees over were engineers 
as of december   sila had approximately employees 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
as part of our continued focus on operational efficiency  we reduced our workforce by approximately persons subsequent to december  item properties our principal offices are located in owings mills  maryland in a  square foot facility under a lease expiring in january with no renewal option 
we also lease an aggregate of approximately  square feet for our offices in larkspur  california  san jose  california  san rafael  california  boca raton  florida  bethesda  maryland  new york  new york  long island  new york  bethpage  new york  mclean  virginia  richmond  virginia  vienna  virginia  washington  dc  tempe  arizona  marlborough  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  edina  mn  yakima  washington  zillah  washington  olmsted  ohio  and monterey  mexico 
of the approximately  leased square feet  approximately  are used for our vertical market segment and approximately  square feet are utilized for corporate and other purposes 
sila has offices located throughout europe 
we are currently holding approximately  square feet of space for sublease which we plan to exit or have exited in connection with our restructuring plans 
we believe that our retained facilities are adequate for the purposes for which they are presently used and that replacement facilities are available at comparable cost  should the need arise 
item legal proceedings aether and certain of our officers and directors are among the defendants named in nine purported class action lawsuits 
these actions were filed on behalf of persons and entities who acquired our common stock after our initial public offering in october  the suits seek damages on account of alleged violations of securities laws 
among other things  the complaints claim that prospectuses  dated october  and september  and issued by us in connection with the public offerings of our common stock  allegedly contained untrue statements of material fact or omissions of material fact in violation of securities laws because the prospectuses allegedly failed to disclose that the offerings underwriters had solicited and received additional and excessive fees  commissions and benefits beyond those listed in the arrangements with certain of their customers which were designed to maintain  distort and or inflate the market price of aether s common stock in the aftermarket 
the actions seek unspecified monetary damages and rescission 
we believe the following claims are without merit and plan to vigorously contest these actions

we are also a party to other legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based on evaluation of these matters and discussions with counsel  we believe that liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of our operations or financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
md a overview aether systems  inc was originally formed as aeros  llc in january we changed our name to aether technologies international  llc effective august and to aether systems llc effective september immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering of common stock on october   the limited liability company was converted into a delaware corporation and our name was changed to aether systems  inc from our inception until march  we primarily provided wireless engineering services  including the development of wireless software applications for customers 
in march  we began offering services that provide the users of wireless handheld devices access to real time financial information 
during  we made a strategic decision to focus a significant portion of our engineering resources on the development of these and other wireless data services and systems  including our aether intelligent messaging aim package of wireless messaging software and software development tools 
in and  we continued to develop financial information services as well as financial transaction services internally and through our acquisition of mobeo  inc in  we also completed our initial public offering and began to expand our service offerings to areas other than financial information and transactions 
in  we continued our expansion into other vertical markets  including the transportation and logistics vertical market through our acquisitions of locusone and motient s retail transportation business unit and the mobile government vertical market through the acquisitions of cerulean and sunpro 
we broadened our software offerings through our purchase of riverbed and rts wireless 
also in  we moved into the european marketplace with our acquisition of ifx  and the related formation of sila 
we entered the general wireless and internet messaging services market through strategic relationships with research in motion rim and others and through our own service offerings 
in  we continued our integration strategy resulting in expense reductions and operational efficiencies 
we focused our efforts on several growth areas including mobile government and transportation and logistics 
we created our enterprise services division to develop and sell enterprise products to large corporations 
also in  we entered into a strategic relationship with aol to provide wireless solutions to small and medium sized businesses 
md a factors affecting comparability our results of operations in and have been affected by acquisitions  investments  impairment charges and the formation of sila 
in addition  a combination of factors has resulted in operating losses that we expect will continue for some time 
the factors identified below have had a significant impact on our operations and should be considered in comparing our results of operations in to those in and in comparing our results of operations in to those in a acquisitions we have acquired companies to expand our product offerings and geographic markets and to acquire additional engineering resources to develop products 
from september through december   we acquired businesses or parts of businesses for an aggregate consideration of million in cash and equity valued at the time of acquisition of billion  consisting of  shares of our common stock and  replacement options 
these acquisitions included the following during  we acquired mobeo for a purchase price and related expenses of million in cash and  options valued at  in early  we acquired locusone  netsearch  and ifx for purchase prices aggregating approximately million 
on march   we acquired riverbed for  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of billion 
in connection with our acquisition of riverbed  we incurred costs totaling approximately million 
in september  we acquired cerulean  sunpro and sinope for purchase prices and related expenses aggregating approximately million and  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of million 
on november   we acquired motient s retail transportation business unit for million in cash and related expenses 
on december   we acquired rts for a purchase price of million in cash and related expenses plus  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of million 
our acquisitions increase our operating revenues and expenses from the date of acquisition 
in the discussion of results below  we quantify the effects of acquisitions on our revenues and expenses 
generally  acquisitions also increased our depreciation and amortization expense as we amortize the value of acquisition intangibles 
however during we wrote down the value of the intangible assets related to acquisitions significantly and as such  our amortization expense in decreased from the prior year 
see the section entitled impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of this write down 
finally  acquisitions affect non cash compensation when we issue options to employees at the time of an acquisition 
b formation of sila on may   we formed sila with reuters to extend our operations to the european market 
we contributed our ifx subsidiary which we purchased for million shortly before forming sila  plus million in cash to acquire a interest in sila 
reuters contributed cash of approximately million and futures pager limited  a european paging company  for the remaining interest 
the results of sila are consolidated in our financial statements 
c investments we have made investments through aether capital  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to promote the development of new technologies that are compatible with the services we offer or that we may wish to integrate into our services 
since august  we have invested approximately million in companies 
these investments currently include six publicly traded and private companies in which we exercise significant influence or have an ownership interest greater than twenty percent 
we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting and record our proportionate share of the investee s net income or loss 
we currently have investments in five publicly traded companies in which we do not exercise significant influence or have an ownership interest greater than twenty percent 
we account for these investments at fair value based on quoted market prices 
net unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from income and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity unless the decline is deemed to be other than temporary 
subsequent to our investment  the market values of these investments have decreased significantly 
in some cases we have determined the decline in market value of our investments in publicly traded companies to be other than temporary  and as such have recorded realized losses on these investments  which are included in net loss 
see impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of this write down 
we also currently have investments in eleven private companies 
we account for these investments at cost unless circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable  at which time the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to fair value 
subsequent to our investment  we have written down the carrying value of our investments to fair value 
see the section entitled impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of this write down 
d impairment charges i acquisitions from through december   we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions 
in addition  we have made investments in other businesses totaling approximately million during this period 
we perform an on going analysis of the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles and the value of our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based on quantitative and qualitative measures  we assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present 
the impairment conditions evaluated by us may change from period to period  given that we operate in a volatile business environment 
a number of factors indicated that impairments may have occurred in the year ended december  consideration for some of our acquisitions was partially or fully funded through the issuance of shares of our common stock at a time when our stock price was at historically high prices 
our stock price ranged from to per share at the time of these acquisitions 
at december   our stock price was per share 
most of the companies we acquired or invested in are start up or newly formed entities 
most of these companies were privately held and their fair values are highly subjective and not readily determinable 
at the time of these acquisitions and investments  market valuations and the availability of capital for such companies was at historically high levels 
during  stock prices and market valuations in our industry and similar industries fell substantially in response to a variety of factors  including a general downturn in the economy  a curtailment in the availability of capital and a general reduction in technology expenditures 
based on the factors described above  we determined during that the goodwill and other intangibles from our acquisitions may have become impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed undiscounted cash flow analyses of our acquisitions to determine whether any impairments existed 
when the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets  we determined a range of fair values using a combination of valuation methodologies 
the methodologies included discounted cash flow analysis  which is based upon converting expected future cash flows to present value 
changes in market value since the date of acquisition relative to the following our stock price  comparable companies  the nasdaq composite index  and a composite of companies that operate within our industry 
market price multiples of comparable companies 
contribution to our market valuation 
the methodologies used were consistent with the specific valuation methods used when the original purchase price was determined 
our best estimate of the fair value was determined from the range of possible values after considering the relative performance  future prospects and risk profile of the acquired company 
in connection with the valuation of the riverbed acquisition  we engaged an independent third party to determine the fair value of the acquired business  because of the magnitude of the acquisition and the associated potential impairment 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to our acquisitions were not fully recoverable 
accordingly  during  we recorded impairment charges of approximately billion  which represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of riverbed amounted to approximately million 
we also recorded impairment charges to goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisitions of ifx and related formation of sila  locusone communications  inc  netsearch  llc  cerulean technology  inc  sunpro and rts wireless  inc of approximately million 
because the conditions underlying the factors we use to evaluate our acquisitions change from time to time  we could determine that it is necessary to take additional material impairment charges in future periods 
ii investments we adjust the carrying value of our available for sale investments and equity method investments in public companies to market and record the change in market value to other comprehensive income 
in accordance with sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  we assess the decline in market value in certain of our public company investments as other than temporary after reviewing the following factors length of time and extent to which the market value of the investment has been below cost  the financial position and the near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
with respect to investments in private companies including those we account for using the equity method  we perform on going reviews based on quantitative and qualitative measures 
in evaluating our private company investments  we determined a range of fair values based on a combination of the following valuation methods where applicable recent funding rounds 
changes in market value since the date of investment relative to the following our stock price  comparable companies  the nasdaq composite index a composite of companies that operate within our industry 
market price multiples of comparable companies 
the fair value was determined from the range of possible values  after considering the strength of the investee s financial position  future prospects and risk profile of the invested company 
during  we recorded a net charge of million which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the net charge related to net gains losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
because the conditions underlying the factors we use to evaluate investments change from time to time  we could determine that it is necessary to take additional material impairment charges in future periods 
md a critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating the valuation allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  estimating the realizable value of our inventory  valuation of long lived intangible assets  including goodwill  valuation of investments  and restructuring accruals a revenue recognition we derive our revenue from four sources i subscriber revenue ii engineering services iii software and related services  and iv device sales 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue might have differed materially from that reported 
i 
subscriber revenue we derive subscriber revenue from the provision of real time access to business information integrated into existing wireless communication platforms 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we obtain signed binding contracts with our subscribers 
contracts with our wireless data subscribers are generally for a one year period and include a termination penalty if cancelled by the subscriber before the one year period expires 
these contracts are generally renewable at the option of the subscriber for additional one year periods or otherwise continue on a monthly basis until cancelled by the subscriber 
our subscriber contracts contain provisions for elements such as service  activation  and wireless devices 
this requires us to allocate revenue to such elements based on their relative fair values which requires significant management judgments and estimates 
we estimate the relative fair value of the service based on contractual renewal rates 
we estimate the fair value of the equipment based on sales in which the only element of the transaction was equipment 
how we allocate revenue to the elements of the arrangement may affect the period in which the revenue is recognized 
subscriber revenue consists primarily of fixed charges for usage recognized as the service is provided and one time non refundable activation fees recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship 
certain of our customers are billed in advance with revenue deferred and recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement 
also included in subscriber revenue are market exchange fees for access to financial information from the securities exchanges and markets  which are recognized as the service is provided 
ii 
engineering services revenue engineering services revenue is derived from the provision of wireless integration consulting under time and materials and fixed fee contracts 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer 
revenue on fixed fee contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as soon as they become known and estimable 
considerable judgment may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of work to be completed and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some tasks 
if we made different judgements or utilized different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to complete the project  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  and our margins on the project in this reporting period  may have differed materially from that reported 
iii 
software and related services revenue software and related services revenues are generated from licensing software and providing services  including maintenance and technical support  training and consulting 
software revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products 
we recognize the revenue when the license agreement is signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  delivery of the software has occurred  and when we estimate that the collectibility of the fees is probable 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment term  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectibility differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
revenue from licensing software that requires significant customization and modification is recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on the hours incurred in relation to the total estimated hours 
if we made different judgements or utilized different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to customize or modify the software  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  and our margins on the project in this reporting period  may have differed materially from that reported 
service revenues consist principally of maintenance and technical support  which consists of unspecified when and if available product updates and customer telephone support services and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period 
if we allocated more or less value to these when and if deliverables  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
in situations where we host the software and the customer has the option to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and we believe it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to us to host the software  the software element is accounted for in accordance with sop otherwise  such amounts are recognized ratably over the hosting period 
if our assessment of this feasibility were different  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
iv 
device revenue we derive device revenue on the sale of wireless devices used to provide our services 
generally  revenue for device sales is recognized upon delivery 
in cases where  in our judgment  the service is essential to the functionality of the device and only our ongoing service is available for the device  we recognize the device revenue as the ongoing service is provided over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
if management were to judge differently about or above  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
v 
revenue from multiple element arrangements for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the element s of the arrangement that has have not yet been delivered 
the fair value of any undelivered elements is established by using historical evidence specific to aether systems 
for instance  the fair values for maintenance and technical support is based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts and the fair value of services  such as training is based on separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
vi 
revenue from related parties revenue from products and services sold to companies that we have also made strategic investments in related parties is allocated between the investment and revenue recognized based on the relative fair value of the products and services sold and the investment received 
we have determined the fair value of the investments based on the fact that all of our investments were made in participation with other unrelated financial investors at the same price per share as the other investors 
our investment policy generally limits our investments to companies that have completed at least two rounds of financing and generally requires that an unrelated investor lead the round of financing that we participate in 
we have estimated the fair value of products and services sold based on comparable sales transactions to other unrelated companies 
sales to related parties were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we estimated fair values of the products and services differently  the amount of revenue recognized may have differed materially from that reported 
b allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential product returns and the valuation of our accounts receivables 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
we recorded provisions for sales returns of million during the year ended december  provisions recorded for sales returns in and were not significant 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  a portion of our customer base has included customers with a limited operating history that were subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that we are  including rapid changes in technology  no established markets for their products  and intense competition  among others 
in addition  many of these companies required significant infusions of capital to continue operations 
the availability of such capital has been curtailed during and some of these companies were not able to raise sufficient funds to continue their operations 
as a result  we recorded bad debt expense of million during the year ended december  as of december   our net accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts of million 
amounts included in our accounts receivable from customers with limited operating history as of december  were not significant 
we recorded bad debt expense of approximately million during the year ended december  bad debt expense in was not significant 
if we had used different estimates and assumptions related to the amount of sales returns we would receive  and about the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our provisions for sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts may have differed materially from that reported 
c valuation of inventory inventory  net of allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory  consists of finished goods such as handheld and laptop computers  pagers  wireless modems  and accessories and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard costing method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
our inventory is subject to rapid technological changes that could have an adverse impact on its realization in future periods 
in addition  there are a limited number of suppliers of our inventory 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of our inventory due to obsolescence and excess inventory 
we estimated the reduction in inventory value based on our consideration of the following quantities and composition of inventory held  sales prices of competing vendors  projected unit sales and unit pricing over subsequent twelve month period  and evaluation of remaining inventory purchase commitments 
if our projections were different  our margins on device sales may have differed materially from that reported 
if our estimates of projected units sales and unit pricing are less than actual results  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future d valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets and goodwill during  we recorded significant impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
these charges and our accounting policies are described in detail under impairment charges above 
in  we will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for further discussion 
e valuation of investments during  we recorded significant impairment charges on our strategic investments 
these charges and our accounting policies are described under impairment charges above 
f estimation of restructuring accruals during  we implemented an expense reduction plan as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the consolidation of excess facilities and a reduction in our work force 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded charges to earnings during of million 
these charges consisted of a charge of million in the second quarter  a charge of million in the third quarter and a charge of million in the fourth quarter 
the charge related mainly to a workforce reduction of over positions and the closing or consolidation of twelve facilities 
employee separation benefits of million under the restructuring plan include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs and other of million include expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
as of december   the accrued liability related to the restructuring was million 
calculation of the restructuring accrual related to expected losses on subleases requires us to make estimates concerning the expected length of time to sublease the facility  the expected rental rates on subleases  and estimated brokerage expenses associated with executing the sublease 
we used the assistance of independent real estate brokerage firms in the making these estimates and our estimates may be impacted by future economic trends 
the expected losses on subleases have not been discounted 
if the actual results differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring accrual related to expected losses on subleases  including recording additional losses 
md a recent accounting pronouncements a sfas no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
b sfas no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing and recognized intangibles such as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we expect to complete step of the impairment review during the second quarter of and must complete step prior to december  during the first quarter of we will also be required to evaluate the estimated useful lives and separability of our identifiable intangible assets 
since year end  our business has continued to be impacted by significant negative industry and economic trends 
additionally  our stock price has continued to decline since december  and our market capitalization is below our book value 
accordingly  we may be required to record an impairment charge based on our adoption of sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position or results of operations 
c sfas no 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

an additional million of the growth in was from an increase in subscribers that signed on to our existing and new product and service offerings such as wireless messaging and financial services products 
the mobile max product line was obtained in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter of we generally expect the cost of subscriber revenue to increase proportionately with any increase in subscriber revenue 
during  the cost of subscriber revenue increased relative to volume of sales as a result of several factors 
these factors included the increased cost of airtime in germany related to sila and incremental costs associated with providing services to non paying customers obtained in connection with our acquisition of motient s retail transportation business unit 
during we converted some of these non paying customers into paying subscribers by repairing their non working equipment and intend to continue seeking to do so with others 
given these conversions  and given that we no longer have operations in germany  these conditions that have negatively affected margins were temporary 
the increase for was primarily from sales to existing customers and new customers of product and service offerings obtained in connection with our acquisitions

the increase in the third quarter was due to an increase in operating expenses resulting from an inventory impairment charge of million 
the decreases from quarter to quarter were due to decreases in operating expenses as a result of our spending reductions 
we expect ebitda to continue to improve over the next year as throughout the year we continue to reduce our operating expenses and as later in the year we expect revenues to increase 
we expect to continue to use cash to fund operations as we continue to develop our products and markets 
the time at which our operating revenues will exceed operating expenses  if ever  depends on a wide variety of factors including general business trends  development of our markets  the progress of and changes in our research and development activities the success of our efforts to reduce costs and the effect of potential future acquisitions 
given our current cash resources and our ability to control some of the factors that will affect when operating revenues may exceed operating expenses  we believe we have substantial flexibility to continue operations and still have funds available for our operating and capital requirements for the next months 
for fiscal year  we currently have contractual cash commitments of approximately million relating to rim inventory purchase commitments  novatel modem purchase commitment with omnisky  aol time warner advertising purchasing commitments  debt service and funding for sila 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that actual expenditures related to these items in will be significantly less than million due to reductions we are in the process of negotiating and due to a reduction of debt service as a result of a debt buyback in march of in addition to the specific expenditures identified above  we expect to continue to invest cash on other capital expenditures  including acquisitions and other strategic opportunities 
the following table describes all of our contractual commitments including our future minimum lease payments 
year ended december  thereafter  million of our minimum lease payments have been subleased or are available for sublease 
although there can be no assurance  we expect actual expenditures related to the above commitments will be less than indicated above due to reductions we are in the process of negotiating and due to a reduction in debt service as a result of a debt buy back in march of on november   we entered into a strategic alliance with aol to develop and market wireless solutions to small and medium sized businesses 
aol will pay us million in development fees to extend certain aol functionality to wireless platforms for the small and medium sized business market  plus  for providing sales force automation solutions to aol 
additionally we may work together with aol to develop applications that will work in conjunction with the wireless platforms 
we have agreed to share with aol  of any net revenues we receive from our sale of these products if certain revenue targets are met 
as part of the agreement  we will pay a license fee of million for access to certain tangible and intangible assets of aol including certain intellectual property rights 
in connection with the alliance  aol agreed to purchase  upon our request  and subject to certain conditions  up to million of our stock over the next three years at then market values preceeding the respective dates of purchase 
on december  aol made its first million purchase of our stock 
as part of the alliance  we took the opportunity to consolidate our media purchases and committed over the next four years  to use most of our million per year advertising budget to promote these new products  as well as our current and future wireless data products and services  across the family of aol interactive brands as well as aol time warner s broad range of media properties 
subsequent to december  we announced that we expanded our products  services and customer base in the transportation and logistics market through the acquisition of certain assets from track communications  inc for million in cash plus million in a convertible note 
md a risk factors our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including those described below 
a we have historically incurred losses and these losses may continue in the future 
we reported net losses of billion  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  systems development and administrative expenses 
therefore  we will need to generate significant revenue to become profitable and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
b there is no established market for our services  we may not be able to sell enough of our services to become profitable 
the markets for wireless data and transaction services are still emerging 
continued growth in demand for  and acceptance of  these services remains uncertain 
current barriers to market acceptance of these services include cost  reliability  functionality and ease of use 
we cannot be certain that these barriers will be overcome 
we are currently developing services for some of our business customers pursuant to preliminary agreements  and expect to develop other aether products 
we cannot assure you that these parties will enter into contracts for our services or that products developed for future sale will result in revenue 
our competitors may develop alternative wireless data communications systems that gain broader market acceptance than our systems 
if the market for our services does not grow  or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  we may not be able to attract customers for our services and our revenues would be adversely affected 
c our customers include technology companies that may be experiencing shortages in capital 
our customers include newly formed technology based companies that have a limited operating history and many have reported significant losses since inception 
they are subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that we are  including rapid changes in technology  no established markets for their products  and intense competition  among others 
in addition  many of these companies may require significant infusions of capital to continue operations 
the availability of such capital has been curtailed and some of these companies may not be able to raise sufficient funds to continue to operate  which could limit our ability to generate further revenues from such companies as well as to collect their outstanding receivables 
d our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances may not deliver the value we paid or will pay for them 
excessive expenses may result if we do not successfully integrate our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances  or if the costs and management resources we expend in connection with the integrations exceed our expectations 
we expect that our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances and any acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances we may pursue in the future will have a continuing  significant impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the value of the companies that we acquired or invested in may be less than the amount we paid and our financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to assimilate the acquired assets with our pre existing business  we lose key employees of these companies or of aether as a result of the acquisitions  our management s attention is diverted by other business concerns  or we assume unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets 
in addition  the companies we have acquired or invested in or may acquire or invest in are subject to each of the business risks we describe in this section  and if they incur any of these risks the businesses may not be as valuable as the amount we paid 
further  we cannot guarantee that we will realize the benefits or strategic objectives we were seeking to obtain by acquiring or investing in these companies 
e we may not achieve profitability if we are unable to maintain  improve and develop the wireless data services we offer 
we believe that our future business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our current services and to develop new ones on a timely basis 
our services will have to achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our service offerings  major new wireless data services and service enhancements require long development and testing periods 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new services and service enhancements 
additionally  our new services and service enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
if we cannot effectively develop and improve services we may not be able to recover our fixed costs or otherwise become profitable 
f if we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change  our services may become obsolete and we may lose sales 
the wireless and data communications industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  industry standards  customer needs and competition  as well as by frequent new product and service introductions 
our services are integrated with wireless handheld devices and the computer systems of our corporate customers 
our services must also be compatible with the data networks of wireless carriers 
we must respond to technological changes affecting both our customers and suppliers 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new services that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accomplish all of the following in a timely and cost effective manner effectively use and integrate new wireless and data technologies  continue to develop our technical expertise  enhance our wireless data  engineering and system design services  develop applications for new wireless networks  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes 
g we depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers such as verizon wireless  bell south corporation  metrocall  motient and at t wireless and on the reliability and security of their systems 
all of our services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties 
we depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and bug free service and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service 
in addition  our expenses would increase and our profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services 
our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one year terms 
some of these wireless carriers are  or could become  our competitors and if they compete with us they may refuse to provide us with their services 
h one of our suppliers of wireless network capacity has filed for reorganization under chapter  which raises uncertainty regarding its ability to continue to supply us with access to its wireless data network 
if the supplier were unable to continue to supply us with capacity  replacing that capacity would be costly or impossible  which could cause a material increase in costs or loss in revenue 
motient corporation  which supplies us with wireless network capacity  has filed for reorganization under chapter although motient currently is continuing to meet its obligations to provide us with wireless network capacity  its chapter filing creates uncertainty regarding its ability to continue to do so 
if motient becomes unable to continue to supply us with the same level of network capacity  we would need to replace that capacity in order to continue meeting our obligations to our customers 
the increased costs of obtaining this capacity  or the loss of revenue if we were unable to replace the capacity or lost customers  would increase our losses or reduce earnings 
i our failure to develop recognition for the aether brand could prevent us from achieving a profitable level of sales 
our expenses related to sales and marketing activities excluding option and warrant expense were  million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we intend to increase the market presence of our brand over time and continue to focus on generating leads and sales opportunities  which will require us to continue our spending on sales and marketing 
the following trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office scoutsync  cerulean  cerulean design  packetcluster  packetcluster patrol  packetwriter  mobilemax  advantage 
the following trademarks have been published or allowed by the united states patent and trademark office aether  aether systems  aether design  unwired by aether  scoutbuilder  scoutit  scoutweb  scoutextend  mobile finance by aether  aether airlead  aether attache  aether smart agent  mobilefusion  mobilefusion design  safestop  information for a wireless world  pocketinvestigator  pro however  in connection with our efforts to reduce operating expenses  we plan to reduce our sales and marketing expenses significantly in although we believe we can effectively market aether s brand with reduced costs  our efforts may be less successful than if our expenses remained at historic levels 
there can be no assurances that holders of other trademarks will not claim that the published or allowed trademarks  or other aether pending trademark applications  infringe their trademarks 
we may not be able to use these names effectively or at all if we fail to obtain such registrations due to conflicting marks or otherwise 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we expect to market our acquired products and services under their existing brands 
we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers if these brands are not well received by our customers  if our marketing efforts are not productive  if we are otherwise unsuccessful in increasing our brand awareness or if our competition has greater brand recognition 
j as we implement our plan to reduce our operating expenses  we may fail to support our operations  which could reduce demand for our services and materially adversely affect our revenue 
our business strategy is based on the assumption that the number of subscribers to our services  the amount of information they want to receive and the number of services we offer will all increase 
we must continue to develop and expand our systems and operations to accommodate this growth 
the expansion and or maintenance and adaptation of our customer service and network operations centers require substantial financial  operational and management resources 
at the same time  we have implemented plans to reduce our operating expenses  which entails a reduction in operational and management resources 
while we believe that our cost reductions are targeted at areas that are not necessary to maintain and develop our ability to serve customers  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in lowering costs while maintaining our ability to provide service 
if we fail to maintain or improve service levels  we may lose customers and or the opportunity to provide more services and products 
k we depend on recruiting and retaining key management and technical personnel with wireless data and software experience 
we may not be able to develop new products or support existing products if we cannot hire or retain qualified employees 
because of the technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete  our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees 
competition for qualified personnel in the wireless data and software industries is intense and finding qualified personnel with experience in both industries is even more difficult 
we believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills in the field of wireless data communication  and it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire and retain these persons 
competitors and others have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to recruit our employees 
each of our engineers has entered into a non competition agreement with us for a period of ten months after they leave aether 
these agreements will not prevent our engineers from leaving or working for competitors relatively soon after they leave us 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy for david s 
oros  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we do not maintain insurance policies for any of our other executive officers 
l we may not have adequately protected our intellectual property rights  which could allow competitors to develop similar products using similar technology  thus reducing our sales and revenue 
we have attempted to protect our technology  including the technology we have obtained or will obtain in our acquisitions  through patent  trademark and copyright protection  as well as through trade secret laws and non competition and non disclosure agreements with all employees 
patents may infringe on valid patents held by third parties  or patents held by third parties may limit the scope of any patents we receive 
in particular  the patent we acquired in our acquisition of riverbed covers a technology that is similar to other patented technologies 
in addition  we have applied for but have as yet no international patent protection in this technology 
if we are not adequately protected  other companies with sufficient engineering expertise could develop competing products based on our intellectual property and reduce our sales and revenue 
m we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur costs of defense and possibly royalties or lose the right to use technology important to providing our services 
the telecommunications and software industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of participants in our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us could increase 
intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  could require us to enter into costly royalty arrangements  could divert management attention from administering our business and could hinder us from conducting our business 
n we may be subject to liability for transmitting information  and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from this liability 
we may be subject to claims relating to information transmitted over systems we develop or operate 
these claims could take the form of lawsuits for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other actions based on the nature and content of the materials 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
o disruption of our services due to accidental or intentional security breaches may harm our reputation  potentially causing a loss of sales and an increase in our expenses 
a significant barrier to the growth of wireless data services or transactions on the internet or by other electronic means has been the need for secure transmission of confidential information 
our systems could be disrupted by unauthorized access  computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
if a third party were able to misappropriate our users personal or proprietary information or credit card information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our revenue and may result in the loss of customers 
p any type of systems failure could reduce sales  increase costs or result in claims of liability 
our existing wireless data services are dependent on real time  continuous feeds from reuters selectfeed plus and others 
the ability of our subscribers to make securities trades  receive sales leads and receive critical business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers 
any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could result in delays in our subscribers ability to receive information or execute trades 
we cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience a hardware or software failure or if there is an earthquake  fire or other natural disaster  a power or telecommunications failure  intentional disruptions of service by third parties  an act of god or an act of war 
a failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data  and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business 
q our ability to sell new and existing services at a profit could be impaired by competitors 
intense competition could develop in the market for services we offer 
we developed our software using standard industry development tools 
many of our agreements with wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers and data providers are non exclusive 
our competitors could develop and use the same products and services in competition with us 
with time and capital  it would be possible for competitors to replicate our services 
our potential competitors could include wireless network carriers such as verizon wireless and at t wireless  software developers such as microsoft corporation  solutions and systems integrators such as ibm 
many of our potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  competitors may develop a different approach to marketing the services we provide in which subscribers may not be required to pay for the information provided by our services 
competition could reduce our market share or force us to lower prices to unprofitable levels 
r we may lose the opportunity to pursue desirable projects to inciscent  sila and mindsurf and other companies in which we hold equity interests  because some of our directors and executive officers serve on the boards of directors of these companies 
david s 
oros  our chairman and chief executive officer  and some of our other executive officers and directors have been appointed to the boards of directors of companies in which we hold an equity interest  including  sila  mindsurf and inciscent 
these other companies may develop products that compete with our own products 
mr 
oros and the other directors and executive officers may learn of business opportunities that are appropriate for the boards on which they serve and mr 
oros and these other individuals may not be required to make those opportunities available to us 
if sila  inciscent  mindsurf or any other joint ventures we may enter into pursue opportunities that we would have an interest in pursuing  our business may fail to grow or our existing business may suffer 
mr 
oros and these other directors and executive officers may also have other conflicts of interest with aether because of their positions with sila  inciscent and mindsurf and sila s  inciscent s and mindsurf s contractual relationships with aether 
s an interruption in the supply of products and services that we obtain from third parties could cause a decline in sales of our services  and products we purchase to avoid shortages may become obsolete before we can use them 
in designing  developing and supporting our wireless data services  we rely on wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers  content providers and software providers 
these suppliers may experience difficulty in supplying us products or services sufficient to meet our needs or they may terminate or fail to renew contracts for supplying us these products or services on terms we find acceptable 
any significant interruption in the supply of any of these products or services could cause a decline in sales of our services unless and until we are able to replace the functionality provided by these products and services 
we also depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
in addition  we rely on the ability of our content providers including reuters  the new york stock exchange  inc  the chicago board of trade  the nasdaq stock market  inc and the options price reporting authority to continue to provide us with uninterrupted access to the news and financial information we provide to our customers 
the failure of third parties to meet these criteria  or their refusal or failure to deliver the information for whatever reason  could materially harm our business 
t our sales cycle is long  and our stock price could decline if sales are delayed or cancelled 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating performance are exacerbated by the length of time between our first contact with a business customer and the first revenue from sales of services to that customer or end users 
because our services represent a significant investment for our business customers  we spend a substantial amount of time educating them regarding the use and benefits of our services and they  in turn  spend a substantial amount of time performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals before purchasing our services 
as much as a year may elapse between the time we approach a business customer and the time we begin to deliver services to a customer or end user 
any delay in sales of our services could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly from projected results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  we may spend a significant amount of time and money on a potential customer that ultimately does not purchase our services 
u our software may contain defects or errors  and our sales could go down if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software 
our software products and platforms are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
we must develop our services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets 
software as complex as ours is likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
our software may not be free from errors or defects after delivery to customers has begun  which could result in the rejection of our software or services  damage to our reputation  lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased service and warranty costs 
v new laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase our costs or reduce our opportunities to earn revenue 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses in general 
however  in the future  we may become subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
in addition  the wireless carriers who supply us airtime and certain of our hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the fcc and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services 
w we conduct operations in a number of countries through sila and other subsidiaries and are subject to risks of international operations 
we currently operate outside the us through sila and other subsidiaries  which have operations throughout europe and asia 
we expect that sila s management will independently perform the day to day operations of our joint venture and will not be within our day to day control 
any failure by sila and other subsidiaries to successfully implement or maintain services could result in negative publicity and have an unfavorable impact on our ability to expand our products and services to europe and asia 
we face various risks in expanding outside the us  including difficulty and cost of monitoring our international operations  cultural differences in the conduct of business  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  and recessionary or inflationary environments in foreign economies  particularly in asian countries and in the financial services sector 
we cannot ensure that our international operations will contribute positively to our business  financial condition or result of operations 
our failure to manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in international markets 
in addition  our expanding operations outside the us are  in some instances  conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could cause currency exchange losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
x debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
as a result of the million of convertible subordinated notes due currently outstanding  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  primarily consisting of the notes 
as a result of this indebtedness  we are obligated to make principal and interest payments 
there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing arrangements will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
y we may not be able to recover the full value of goodwill recorded on some of our acquisitions and investments 
during   and  we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions and made investments in other companies of approximately million 
consideration for some of our acquisitions was partially or fully funded through the issuance of shares of our common stock at a time when our stock price was at historically high prices 
most of the companies we acquired or invested in were start up or newly formed entities 
most of these companies were privately held and their fair values are highly subjective and not readily determinable 
our policy is to review the value of all our acquisitions and investments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at the time of our acquisitions and investments  market valuations and the availability of capital for such companies were at historically high levels 
during the year ended december   stock prices and market valuations in our industry and similar industries have fallen substantially in response to a variety of factors  including a general downturn in the economy  a curtailment in the availability of capital and a general reduction in technology expenditures 
the market valuations of those publicly traded companies in which we have invested and of other companies similar to those we have acquired or invested in have declined substantially 
for the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges aggregating billion on these acquisitions and investments 
if similar adverse market conditions develop in the future  we may be required to take additional impairment charges 
z we may have to take actions that are disruptive to our business strategy to avoid registration under the investment company act of as part of our business strategy  we own minority and majority equity interests in a number of ventures 
while we believe we are not currently an investment company  our ownership of these securities could potentially subject us to registration under the investment company act of  which  absent an applicable exclusion or exemption  requires registration for companies that are engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities 
if we were required to register as an investment company  we would not be able to continue operating our business in accordance with our business plan 
accordingly  we intend to take all necessary steps to avoid being deemed an investment company 
a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding of its total assets excluding cash items and government securities as defined in the investment company act  subject to certain exclusions and exemptions 
any acquisition or disposition of assets  or fluctuations in the value of our assets may require us to take steps to avoid registration under the investment company act 
in particular  a write down of the value of our acquisitions such as those that may occur as a result of the recent market downturn  could increase the percentage of our total assets accounted for by investment securities 
the steps required to avoid registration could include buying  refraining from buying  selling or refraining from selling securities in circumstances where we would not take these actions except to avoid registration under the investment company act 
for example  we may have to retain majority or controlling interests in our joint ventures after their initial public offerings  which would require us to expend significant amounts of capital that we might otherwise use to expand our products and services in other market segments 
moreover  we may incur tax liabilities if we are required to sell assets 
we may also be unable to purchase additional investment securities that may be important to our business strategy 
we have applied to the sec for an exemptive order declaring that we are not an investment company and are not required to register under the investment company act 
we may not ultimately be successful in receiving such an order 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our excess funds are invested in cash equivalents with maturities of less than ninety days 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term low risk instruments 
at december   we had million including restricted cash invested in money market  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
at december   we had million in investments with maturities that range from less than one year to ten years 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate subordinated convertible notes payable 
the fair value of this fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
if market rates decline  the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policy  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates  we have minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes associated with our long term debt obligations 
foreign rate sensitivity since the acquisition of ifx and the related formation of sila and the commencement of us sales to foreign countries  we have been exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
all sales from the us to foreign countries have been denominated in us dollars 
since the revenue and expenses of sila generally are denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the us dollar will subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of sila as well as risks sometimes associated with international operations 
the countries in which sila has operations have traditionally had relatively stable currencies 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure 
we believe that a increase or decline in the british pound exchange ratio would not be material to cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income  or cash flows from consolidated operations
