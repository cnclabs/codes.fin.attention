item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations applied develops  manufactures  markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry 
demand for applied s products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors  the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers  and advanced technology and or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers 
for this and other reasons  applied s results of operations for fiscal  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  applied implemented the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the first three fiscal quarters of have been restated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts prior to fiscal have not been restated 
net sales applied s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in applied s quarterly new orders and net sales  both within and across fiscal years 
demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors  including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
quarterly new orders and net sales were as follows quarter fiscal first second third fourth year in millions new orders      net sales     new orders      net sales      new orders      net sales      each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause  and in the past have caused  capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
net sales by geographic region were as follows fiscal year ended in millions north america    taiwan    japan   europe   korea asia pacific primarily the united states 
in early fiscal  the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries were beginning to emerge from a downturn and entered a period of expansion 
as a result of the industry expansion  new orders and net sales increased sequentially each quarter during fiscal and fiscal strong demand for applied s products was driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for additional capacity and new technology to meet consumer demand for internet  computing  communications and digital devices 
in addition  the semiconductor industry was continuing the transition to smaller device feature sizes  new materials  such as copper  and mm wafer processing  which required new manufacturing equipment 
for fiscal  applied was able to achieve record levels of new orders  net sales and net income as a result of these factors 
during the first fiscal quarter of  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout the remainder of fiscal into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macro economic climate and consumption of electronic goods  which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied s customers 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal  and decreased to percent for fiscal the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was due primarily to higher business volume  reduced manufacturing cycle times and the favorable effects of operational programs emphasizing productivity improvements and cost reduction 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was caused primarily by decreased business volume  which resulted in factory underabsorption  and changes in product mix with start up costs of new mm products 
research  development and engineering applied s future operating results depend  to a considerable extent  on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides 
applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd e to ensure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced chip designs 
rd e expenses increased for each of the last three years  from million percent of net sales for fiscal to billion percent of net sales for fiscal and to billion percent of net sales for fiscal applied increased its rd e spending for fiscal and to address customers requirements for shrinking device feature sizes  the use of new materials  such as copper  and the transition from mm to mm wafer processing 
applied s investment in research and development for copper based devices resulted in a broad line of copper based products available for sale in fiscal and additionally  applied developed and launched many new products and enhanced versions of its existing products and technologies in fiscal  including new systems for mm wafer processing 
during fiscal  applied continued its development of technologies for copper and low k based chips and mm wafers  as well as focusing efforts on the core technologies that will be required for chipmakers to begin development of micron generation devices 
areas of increased investment include maskmaking technology  metrology and inspection  ion implantation  and products for depositing and etching new materials 
in addition  significant investments were made to develop applied s process module concept  the integration of multiple individual systems with metrology and inspection capabilities and specialized software for feedforward feedback process control 
these systems operate as a single  highly automated unit to perform a particular wafer processing application in a customer s manufacturing process to a specified level of performance 
marketing  selling  general and administrative marketing  selling  general and administrative msg a expenses increased from million percent of net sales for fiscal to million percent of net sales for fiscal  and decreased to million percent of net sales for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily caused by higher costs of incentive and benefit programs  increased investments in various information technology programs  and increased costs to support higher net sales 
the decrease for fiscal was due primarily to cost reduction actions and lower business volume 
non recurring items non recurring items for fiscal consisted of million of merger expenses related to the acquisition of consilium  inc  million of acquired in process research and development expense incurred in connection with the acquisitions of akt and obsidian  inc and million of restructuring charges associated with etec s headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities prior to its acquisition by applied 
non recurring items for fiscal consisted of million of merger expenses related to the acquisition of etec 
during fiscal  applied recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for asset write offs  primarily for fixed assets 
these restructuring actions occurred in applied s second  third and fourth fiscal quarters  and were taken to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing market conditions 
during the second fiscal quarter of  applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately  employees  or three percent of its global workforce  for a cost of million 
during the third fiscal quarter of  applied recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million associated with severance and benefit costs 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  applied eliminated approximately  additional positions  or percent of its global workforce  for a cost of million 
the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara  california and austin  texas  and represented multiple company activities and functions 
non recurring items for fiscal also included million of acquired in process research and development expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of oramir semiconductor equipment ltd 
oramir 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
non recurring income  net net non recurring income of million for fiscal and million for fiscal were related to a litigation settlement with asm international  nv for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income net interest income was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increases from year to year can be attributed primarily to increasing cash and investment balances over the three year period 
provision for income taxes applied s effective income tax rate was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal and percent for fiscal applied s actual effective income tax rate for fiscal of percent differed from the expected effective income tax rate of percent due to the non tax deductible nature of million of acquired in process research and development expense 
the reduction to a percent effective income tax rate for fiscal resulted primarily from a shift in the geographic composition of pre tax income to entities operating in countries with lower tax rates 
applied expected an effective income tax rate of percent for fiscal  which decreased from the fiscal effective rate due to a shift in the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income 
the actual effective income tax rate for fiscal of percent differed from the expected rate of percent due to the non tax deductible nature of million of acquired in process research and development expense 
applied s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 
business combinations on june   applied acquired oramir  a supplier of advanced laser cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers  in a purchase business combination for million in cash 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events business combinations during the first fiscal quarter of  applied acquired the assets of schlumberger s electron beam wafer inspection business 
in addition  applied acquired global knowledge services  inc  a provider of advanced data mining services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and efficiency 
these transactions will be accounted for as purchase business combinations 
these acquisitions have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
restructuring on december   applied announced a further headcount reduction of approximately  positions  or percent of its global workforce  in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara  california and austin  texas  and represented multiple company activities and functions 
applied will record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of change in accounting policy applied implemented sab for the fourth fiscal quarter of  retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal prior to the implementation of sab  applied generally recognized revenue for established products upon shipment 
the implementation of sab resulted in the following changes to applied s revenue recognition practices for transactions where legal title does not transfer at shipment  revenue will be recognized upon title transfer  which is typically at customer technical acceptance  and for products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  a portion of revenue associated with certain installation related tasks will be recognized when the tasks are completed 
since the implementation was retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal  the first three fiscal quarters of have been restated see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
applied recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  for the restated first fiscal quarter of this charge represents the after tax difference between the new and previous revenue recognition policies for years prior to fiscal as of the implementation date at the beginning of fiscal therefore  no restatement of years prior to fiscal is required 
for periods prior to fiscal  data was not available to provide pro forma information as if the change in accounting principle was applied retroactively 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million included million of revenue recognized prior to fiscal  of which million was recognized during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
applied does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   with certain early adoption permitted 
applied expects to adopt sfas for its first fiscal quarter of  and does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas  which will be effective for applied s fiscal in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas  which will be effective for applied s fiscal for further details regarding the above recent accounting pronouncements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources applied increased its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments from billion at october  to billion at october  applied s financial condition remained strong  with a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at october  and at october  applied generated cash from continuing operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
the primary source of cash from continuing operations has been income from continuing operations  as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization and acquired in process research and development expense 
income from continuing operations  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash items  was billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal the other source or use of cash from continuing operations has been attributable to changes in assets and liabilities other than those assets and liabilities resulting from investing and financing activities 
net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a use of cash during periods of revenue growth because applied generally incurs costs and expends cash in advance of receiving cash from its customers 
likewise  during periods of declining revenue or slowed revenue growth  net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a source of cash because expenditures for inventory and other purchases decrease while receivables from prior periods  which were higher revenue periods  are collected 
the cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities was a million use for fiscal  a million use for fiscal  and a million source for fiscal in addition to being driven by revenue and profitability performance  the cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities is subject to operational efficiency and productivity 
for example  earlier collection of accounts receivable and increased inventory turnover both have a positive effect on cash flow 
applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of million for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal these receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding 
applied has not experienced any losses under these programs  and receivables sold under these programs have terms and credit risk characteristics similar to applied s overall receivables portfolio 
for further details regarding accounts receivable sales  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
applied used million of cash for investing activities for fiscal  billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales of short term investments  purchases of capital assets to support long term growth and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market segments or emerging technology 
applied generated million of cash from financing activities for fiscal  generated million for fiscal and used million for fiscal financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of applied s common stock  as well as borrowings and repayments of debt 
net debt activity used million of cash for fiscal  generated million of cash for fiscal and used million of cash for fiscal net common stock activity generated million of cash for fiscal and million for fiscal as a result of a significant increase in stock sales to employees  reflecting applied s higher average stock price  partially offset by stock repurchases 
during fiscal  net common stock activity used million of cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased  reflecting applied s lower average stock price in fiscal since march  applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stock based employee benefit and incentive plans 
at october   applied s principal sources of liquidity consisted of billion of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and approximately million of available credit facilities 
for further details regarding applied s credit facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to cash and available credit facilities  applied may from time to time raise additional capital in the debt and equity markets 
applied s liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business  and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries 
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
trends  risks and uncertainties the highly cyclical semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing a severe  prolonged downturn 
as suppliers to the semiconductor industry  the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by up and down business cycles  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements  including capacity utilizing the latest technology 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology 
these industry cycles create pressure on applied s net sales  gross margin and net income 
in addition to affecting applied s suppliers  these cycles challenge key management  engineering and other employees who are vital to applied s success 
management believes that the current industry downturn may be the steepest decline in history  and cannot predict when a recovery will begin 
during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders 
during this downturn  applied must be able to quickly and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and motivate and retain key employees 
if applied is unable to achieve its objectives in a timely manner during the current downturn  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth have dramatically decreased demand for semiconductors 
this decreased demand has resulted in excess production capacity for semiconductor manufacturers and has caused these manufacturers to reevaluate their capital spending plans 
delays or cancellations of orders by semiconductor manufacturers have caused  and may continue to cause  fluctuations in the utilization of applied s manufacturing facilities 
continued decreased demand and overcapacity could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
currently  a significant percentage of applied s revenues result from sales outside the us certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located abroad 
managing applied s global operations presents challenges  including periodic regional economic downturns  trade balance issues  varying business conditions and demands  political instability  us export restrictions  shipping delays  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and cultural diversities  among other risks 
for example  global uncertainties with respect to decreased growth rates of gross domestic product in various countries  factory capacity utilization  capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  memory chip price weakness  and political instability in regions where applied has operations  such as israel and the asian region  may affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
applied s competitive advantage and future success depend on its ability to successfully develop new products and technologies  develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services  introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner  qualify new products with its customers  and commence and adjust production to meet customer demands 
the introduction of an increasingly broader set of new products and technologies  including those to support the transition to smaller device feature sizes  new materials and mm wafers  grows increasingly complex over time 
such new product introductions may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied s more established products  and could adversely affect applied s gross margins 
if applied does not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its competitive position  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions 
applied has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 
applied s customer base is highly concentrated 
orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for  and will continue to account for  a substantial portion of applied s net sales 
sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if current customers do not continue to place orders  applied may not be able to replace these orders with new orders from new customers 
the resulting fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations  including but not limited to regulations related to the development  manufacturing and use of its products 
from time to time  applied receives notices alleging violations of these regulations 
it is applied s policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take necessary corrective action 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacturing or use of certain of its products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied s ability to meet customer demand 
applied s business depends on its ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers 
applied s ability to manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts  components  and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers 
some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts  natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes  or other causes such as software issues or infrastructure failures could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies 
any or all of these could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
applied currently is  and in the future may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  antitrust  environmental regulations  contracts and other matters see item legal proceedings 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
in addition  applied s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented  invalidated or obsoleted by the rapid pace of technological change 
furthermore  the laws of other countries permit the protection of applied s proprietary rights to varying extents compared to us laws 
applied s success is dependent in part upon the protection of its intellectual property rights 
infringement of applied s rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied 
if applied is not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  applied s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of applied s investment portfolio  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates  therefore  applied s results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the extent that variable rate short term notes payable are outstanding 
due to the short term nature and insignificant amount of applied s short term notes payable  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk significant operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  certain existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s downside risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
