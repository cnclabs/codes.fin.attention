financial information contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is presented on a consolidated basis 
therefore  within item references to we  our and us refer to us and our subsidiaries 
critical accounting policy disclosure revenue recognition our revenues are generated from licensing the rights to use our software products directly to end users and indirectly through sub license fees from resellers 
in addition  we also generate revenues from selling professional services  including consulting  implementation  training and maintenance and hardware sales 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized when all criteria outlined in statement of position sop software revenue recognition as amended are satisfied 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
where software arrangements involve multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the relative fair values of each element in the arrangement  in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
our vsoe used to allocate the sales price to services and maintenance is based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
license revenue is recorded based on the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements when there is vsoe of the fair values of all the undelivered elements  and all revenue recognition criteria of sop  as amended  are satisfied 
under the residual method any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered element 
we generally do not grant rights of return to our customers 
we generally provide a warranty period of up to six months at no extra charge 
no provision is recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated warranty costs since  in our experience  such costs are immaterial 
sop specifies that extended payment terms in a software licensing arrangement may indicate that the software license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
in addition  if payment of a significant portion of the software license fees is not due until more than twelve months after delivery  the software license fees should be presumed not to be fixed or determinable  and thus should be recognized as the payments become due 
however  sop specifies that if a company has a standard business practice of using extended payment terms in software licensing arrangements and has a history of successfully collecting the software license fees under the original terms of the software licensing arrangement without making concessions  such company overcomes the presumption that the software license fees are not fixed or determinable 
thus  a company should recognize software license fees when all other sop revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we have concluded that for certain software arrangements with extended payment terms  the fixed or determinable presumption has been overcome and software license fees have been recognized upon meeting the remaining sop revenue recognition criteria 
the present value of such software license fees recognized in years  and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
when contracts contain hosting services arrangements  we apply emerging issues task force software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
arrangements that include professional services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when services are considered essential  revenue under the arrangement is recognized using contract accounting 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the software services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from software licenses that require significant customization  integration and installation are recognized based on sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  using contract accounting on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated to be incurred over the duration of the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are first determined in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
as of december  no such estimated losses were identified 
revenue on arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users such as resellers is not recognized until the product has been delivered to the end user 
revenue from maintenance and services are recognized over the life of the maintenance agreement or at the time that services are rendered 
revenue from hardware sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
deferred revenue includes unearned amounts received under maintenance and support contracts and amounts billed to customers but not recognized as revenue 
other critical accounting policies our trade receivables and long term trade receivables primarily include amounts due from banks and large financial institutions 
we generally do not require collateral  however  in certain circumstances  we may require letters of credit  other collateral or additional guarantees 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those specific amounts that we have determined to be doubtful of collection 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
management s assessment for uncertainties of outstanding debts collectibility resulted in a provision for doubtful accounts expenses in total amounts of   and  for  and respectively 
we account for our investments in marketable securities using statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date 
debt securities for which we do not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available for sale  along with any investments in equity securities that have not been classified as trading securities 
as of december  and all marketable securities were designated as available for sale 
as of december   due to the market conditions  and since management believed that the decline in the fair value of the marketable securities was other than temporary  the cost basis of these securities was written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately of our investment in marketable securities 
as of december  an impairment and realized losses on available for sale marketable securities amounting to  was included in earnings 
software development costs incurred in the process of developing product improvements or new products are generally charged to expenses as incurred  net of participation of the office of the chief scientist 
sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design 
our costs incurred between completion of the detailed program design and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been capitalized 
as of december   the company capitalized development costs totaling  in aggregate  which costs have not been amortized as the products are not yet ready for general release to customers 
in response to declines associated with the cautious investment technology spending environment within the financial services industry  during the second quarter of we adopted a restructuring and integration plan 
as part of the plan  through the end of january   we reduced our work force by employees and sublet portions of our existing office space 
in addition  we consolidated aspects of our dallas operation into our existing operations in order to improve efficiency and eliminate duplicate cost structures 
we began to realize the benefits of the plan in the third quarter of as evidenced by the reduction in total maintenance and services costs and total software development expenses 
total maintenance and services costs decreased by  or  to  in the six months ended december  from  in the six months ended june  software development expenses before reduction for capitalization decreased by  or  to  in the six months ended december  from  in the six months ended june  in and  we incurred expenses in connection with new ventures  which were to be reimbursed by such ventures upon the formation of the underlying entities

in april  management and the other investors decided not to proceed with the formation of the entities  which resulted in our writing off the full amount 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
thus  we use the dollar as our functional and reporting currency 
transactions and balances in other currencies are remeasured into dollars in accordance with the principles set forth in fasb statement no 
exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement are recorded as income or expense as applicable 
see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  market risks 
the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is not the us dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
israeli companies  such as ours  are generally subject to income tax at the corporate rate of 
however  we are eligible for certain tax benefits which should result in our income being taxed at a significantly lower rate for some time after we begin to report taxable income and exhaust our net operating loss carry forwards

certain preacquisition contingency reserves were established as of the acquisition dates that are subject to adjustment during the allocation period in accordance with sfas accounting for preacquisition contingencies 
the fair value of the net assets acquired from bbp and sterling has been adjusted to reflect the resolution of these contingencies established relating to certain litigation and liabilities associated with acquired contractual commitments

impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  market risk the dollar cost of our operations in israel is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is or is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar 
inflation in israel will have a negative effect on our profitability of contracts under which we receive payments in us dollars or us dollar linked nis while incurring expenses in nis linked to the israeli cpi  unless such inflation is offset by a devaluation of the nis 
for some time until  inflation in israel exceeded the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar  and we experienced increases in the dollar cost of our operations in israel 
this trend was reversed in and in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  israel experienced inflation at the rate of as well as a devaluation of the us dollar against the nis at the rate of 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation of the dollar against the nis was at the rate of 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation of the us dollar against the nis was at the rate of 
a devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar would have the effect of decreasing the us dollar value of any asset of our assets that consist of nis or receivables payable in nis unless such receivables are linked to the us dollar 
such a devaluation would also have the effect of reducing the us dollar amount of any expenses or liabilities which are payable in nis unless such expenses or payables are linked to the us dollar 
conversely  any increase in the value of the nis in relation to the us dollar would have the effect of increasing the us dollar value of any unlinked nis assets and the us dollar amounts of any unlinked nis liabilities and expenses 
because exchange rates between the nis and the us dollar fluctuate continuously albeit with a historically declining trend in the value of the nis  exchange rate fluctuations  and especially larger periodic devaluations  will have an impact on our profitability and period to period comparisons of our results 
such impact is recorded in our financial statements as financial income or expense 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
effective corporate tax rate our development facility in israel has been granted approved enterprise status under israel s law for the encouragement of capital investments 
we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a portion of our income from approved enterprise investments 
under the approved enterprise program  we are entitled to reductions in the tax rate normally applicable to israeli companies with respect to income generated from our approved enterprise investments 
we are entitled to a tax exemption for a period of two years commencing in the first year in which such income is earned  subject to certain time restrictions 
our first year of tax exemption was at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards in the us of approximately million and million loss carry forwards in israel
