item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is the second largest drilling contractor in the world  owning or operating a high quality  technologically advanced fleet of over drilling rigs 
the company s diversified fleet currently includes floating rigs  jackups  land rigs and one platform rig and the company or its affiliates operate additional marine rigs owned by others 
the company provides offshore oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a dayrate basis 
the company also provides offshore oil and gas drilling management services on a dayrate or turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and participates in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of the company s most significant accounting policies pertaining to properties and depreciation  revenue recognition and income taxes as well as the use of estimates 
properties and depreciation rigs and drilling equipment 
capitalized costs of rigs and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction or refurbishment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of property sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  resulting gains or losses are included in income 
jackup drilling rigs and semisubmersibles are depreciated over lives ranging from to years  with salvage values of million and million  respectively  per rig 
all land drilling rigs are depreciated over year lives with no salvage value 
drillships  with the exception of the glomar explorer  are depreciated over year lives  with salvage values of million per rig 
the glomar explorer is being depreciated over the time that remained on its year lease as of the date it entered service following its conversion to a drillship  or approximately years  with no salvage value 
the company reviews its long term assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development costs 
under this method of accounting  the company capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties and amortizes such costs  together with estimated future development and dismantlement costs  using the units of production method 
revenue recognition the company s contract drilling business provides fully crewed rigs to customers on dayrate basis 
dayrate contracts can be for a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
revenues and expenses from dayrate drilling operations  which are classified under contract drilling services  are recognized on a per day basis as the work progresses 
lump sum fees received as compensation for the cost of relocating drilling rigs from one major operating area to another  whether received up front or upon termination of the drilling contract  are recognized as earned  which is generally over the term of the related drilling contract 
the company also designs and executes specific offshore drilling or well completion programs for customers at fixed prices under short term turnkey contracts 
revenues and expenses from turnkey contracts  which are classified under drilling management services  are earned and recognized upon completion of each contract using the completed contract method of accounting 
income taxes the company is a cayman islands company and is not subject to income taxes in the cayman islands 
consequently  income taxes have been provided based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which the operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income taxes in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
the company s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as the company s operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires that the company achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its nol carryforwards 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management in this report include allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical collection activity 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial position of a major customer or significant changes in the prices of oil or natural gas 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates its rigs and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives 
the company s estimates of these remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
tax estimates 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset requires that the company achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its net operating loss nol carryforwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its nol carryforwards and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from its current estimates 
the company s nol carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where the loss was incurred 
accrued claims and liabilities 
the company estimates its claims liabilities based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigated claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
merger with santa fe international on november   global marine merged with a subsidiary of santa fe international and became a wholly owned subsidiary of santa fe international  which was renamed globalsantafe corporation at the time of the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as the stockholders of global marine owned slightly over of globalsantafe after the merger  global marine was considered the acquiring entity for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the historical basis of global marine in its assets and liabilities has been carried forward to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the assets and liabilities of santa fe international have been recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of the merger in the consolidated financial statements of the company  with the excess of the purchase price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill

the company s prior years data represents the operations of global marine only 
in connection with the merger  the company has implemented a restructuring program designed to streamline its organization and improve efficiency 
the restructuring involves a workforce reduction of approximately positions  the consolidation of santa fe international s administrative office in dallas and global marine s administrative office in lafayette into global marine s houston office and the consolidation of santa fe international s and global marine s north sea administrative offices in aberdeen  scotland 
the employee functions affected are primarily corporate support in nature and include accounting  information technology  and employee benefits  among others 
approximately of the affected positions are located in dallas  are located in houston  and the remaining are located in europe

the largest drilling market in the world is the us gulf of mexico jackup market 
this market is strongly influenced by the price of natural gas  which began to weaken considerably in the first quarter of natural gas prices have continued to decline into the first quarter of  and high natural gas storage levels  a weak us economy and a warmer than normal winter will likely delay the recovery of us natural gas prices until late or sometime in until us natural gas prices improve  demand for the company s jackup rigs in the us gulf of mexico is expected to remain soft  and dayrates are anticipated to remain near cash breakeven levels 
with about of the company s offshore drilling fleet now operating in international markets  however  the company is somewhat insulated from weakness in the us gulf of mexico market 
international drilling activity remained strong throughout utilization and dayrates either improved or remained steady at high rates for the company s international operations  although some signs of dayrate softening appeared in certain sectors of the international jackup market in late a continuation of weak natural gas prices and a soft jackup market in the us gulf of mexico could result in additional softening of certain international markets as rigs may begin to mobilize out of the gulf of mexico to other markets 
in june  the company completed the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system to exxon neftegas limited for million  resulting in a pretax gain in the amount of million 
in february  the company sold the key bermuda jackup drilling rig to nabors drilling international for approximately million 
no gain will be recognized on this sale because the key bermuda was recorded at fair value at the time of the merger 
the financial and operating results of the company include only days of combined results of global marine and santa fe international 
although the inclusion of the santa fe international results did not materially impact results  it is expected that their inclusion will have a significant impact on the future results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the following unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma results for the years ended december  and have been prepared as if the merger had occurred on january  if global marine and santa fe international had merged on this date  globalsantafe might have performed differently 
the pro forma financial information should not be relied on as an indication of the financial position or results of operations that the company would have achieved had the merger taken place at a different date or of the future results that the company will achieve 
year ended december  in millions  except per share data revenues   operating income income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted the pro forma information includes adjustments for additional revenue based on the fair market value of certain drilling contracts acquired  additional depreciation based on the fair market value of drilling rigs and other property and equipment acquired  elimination of goodwill amortization and related adjustments for income taxes  reflecting the incremental benefit attributable to the effect of the company s tax structure on the earnings of the combined companies

excludes the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system  which was sold in june contract drilling revenues increased by million in compared to approximately million of this increase was attributable to global marine s fleet  and million was attributable to santa fe international s fleet from the merger date 
of the million increase in global marine s contract drilling revenues in as compared to  million was attributable to the addition of the glomar cr luigs drillship in april and the glomar jack ryan drillship in december  million was attributable to an increase in average dayrates  and million was attributable to an increase in average rig utilization 
the increase in average dayrates in as compared to was primarily due to operations in west africa and the us gulf of mexico  and the increase in average rig utilization was primarily due to operations in west africa and the north sea 
of the million in contract drilling revenues attributable to santa fe international s fleet  million was attributable to marine rigs and million was attributable to land rigs 
contract drilling revenues increased by million to million in compared to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to the addition of the glomar cr luigs and glomar jack ryan drillships in april and december  respectively  and million was attributable to an increase in average rig utilization 
these increases in contract drilling revenues were partly offset by a million decrease attributable to lower average dayrates 
the increase in average rig utilization in as compared to was due primarily to operations in the us gulf of mexico and west africa  partly offset by lower average utilization in the north sea 
the lower average dayrates were due in part to the expiration of higher dayrate contracts signed when offshore drilling markets were tighter and to unanticipated rig downtime attributable primarily to repair work on certain deepwater rigs 
these decreases were partly offset by higher dayrates for jackup rigs in the us gulf of mexico 
the company s average utilization rate for its drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico was  and for  and  respectively 
the company s average utilization rate for its rigs located offshore west africa was  and for  and  respectively 
average utilization rates for the company s rigs in the north sea was  and for  and  respectively 
for the day period following the merger  the company s average utilization for rigs operating in international areas other than those previously listed was 
the mobilization of rigs among the geographic areas shown in the preceding table also affected each area s revenues over the periods indicated 
during  the company mobilized two jackups from west africa to the us gulf of mexico  one jackup from the north sea to the us gulf of mexico  one drillship from west africa to offshore peru  and one drillship from the us gulf of mexico to west africa 
during  the company mobilized one drillship from offshore peru to west africa and one drillship from west africa to the us gulf of mexico 
during  the company mobilized one drillship from the us gulf of mexico to offshore brazil and back to the us gulf of mexico  one jackup from west africa to the us gulf of mexico  one drillship from trinidad to the us gulf of mexico  one semisubmersible from offshore the east coast of canada to the north sea  one jackup from the us gulf of mexico to west africa  and two jackups from the us gulf of mexico to trinidad 
as of february   of the company s marine rigs were located in the north sea  were in the us gulf of mexico  nine were offshore west africa  eight were in the middle east  six were in the far east  four were offshore trinidad  and one was offshore the east coast of canada 
of the company s marine rigs  rigs were operating under contract or had commitments to commence operations soon thereafter and four were in the shipyard 
as of february   of the company s active land rigs were located in the middle east  four were in north africa and eight were in south america 
of the company s active land rigs  were operating under contract and five were idle 
operating income and operating margin increased to million and  respectively  for compared to million and  respectively  for primarily due to higher revenues for as discussed above  partly offset by higher operating expenses 
operating expenses increased by million to million in from million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to global marine s fleet  and million was attributable to santa fe international s fleet from the merger date 
the increase in global marine s contract drilling operating expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher operating costs in connection with the full year operations of the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan drillships  an increase in rig utilization  and full year crewed operations of the maersk jutlander  which was being leased from the company under a bareboat charter for most of under this bareboat charter  the company provided the customer with the rig  and the customer used its own crews to operate the rig 
the company s operating profit margin for contract drilling operations increased to in from in primarily due to the increase in average rig utilization noted above 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher depreciation and other operating costs incurred in connection with the addition of the glomar cr luigs and higher operating costs due to fewer idle rigs in as compared to drilling management services drilling management services revenues decreased by million to million in from million in approximately million of this decrease was attributable to global marine s operations  offset by a million increase attributable to operations of santa fe international after the merger 
the decrease in global marine s revenues consisted of a million decrease attributable to a decrease in the number of turnkey projects  partly offset by a million increase attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project and a million increase attributable to daywork and other revenues 
the company completed turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions as compared to projects in wells drilled and well completions 
drilling management services revenues increased by million to million in from million in the increase in revenues consisted of a million increase attributable to an increase in the number of turnkey projects  a million increase attributable to daywork and other revenues  and a million increase attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project 
the company completed turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions as compared to turnkey projects in wells drilled and well completions 
operating income for drilling management services increased by million to million in from million in  and operating profit margin increased to in from in of the million increase in drilling management services operating income for as compared to  million was attributable to global marine  and million was attributable to the operations of santa fe international from the merger date 
the increase in operating margin in as compared to was due in part to the company incurring fewer loss wells in as compared to the company incurred losses totaling million on of the turnkey projects in as compared to losses totaling million incurred on of the turnkey projects during also contributing to the increase in the company s operating margin in as compared to was a turnkey well drilled in the north sea in december the turnkey drilling contract guaranteed the company recovery of its turnkey drilling costs upon completion of the well and included a provision for additional revenue based on production from the well 
the company received million of additional revenue from this well in the fourth quarter of  all of which was operating profit 
the company expects to receive an estimated million of additional revenue under the turnkey contract in the first quarter of operating income for drilling management services increased by million to million in from million in  and operating profit margin increased to in from in results for drilling management services in were mixed 
the company completed a record number of turnkey projects in  however  margins were below expectations due in part to losses totaling million incurred on of the turnkey projects during the year 
the losses resulted in part from an aggressive pricing strategy intended to protect market share and in part to a dilution of experienced rig crew personnel across the fleet of third party rigs used by the company  as rig utilization was reaching a peak in the fourth quarter of the company believes this dilution of experienced personnel translated into an additional days of drilling time per well  on average  and an estimated to million of total additional cost in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company experienced a higher than normal incidence of problem wells during the fourth quarter of related to hazards inherent in oil and gas drilling operations 
as a result  the company implemented a plan in early to increase budgeted margins and estimated drilling time in its bids to restore margins to more historical levels 
results of operations from the company s drilling management services may be limited by certain factors  in particular the ability of the company to find and retain qualified personnel  to hire suitable rigs at acceptable rates  and to obtain and successfully perform turnkey drilling contracts based on competitive bids 
the company s ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts is largely dependent on the number of such contracts available for bid  which in turn is influenced by market prices for oil and gas  among other factors 
accordingly  results of the company s drilling management service operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
other income and expense general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in of the million increase in general and administrative expense from to  million was attributable to the operations of santa fe international after the merger and was attributable to global marine 
the increase in global marine s general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in information systems costs and professional fees  partly offset by lower compensation expense 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was due to lower professional fees and other expenses resulting from the company s cost cutting program  partly offset by higher compensation expense 
interest expense was million for  million for  and million for the decrease in interest expense from to reflects lower effective interest rates for the year due to the issuance of the zero coupon convertible debentures in june as well as lower debt balances 
the increase in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to higher levels of debt incurred to finance the upgrade and construction of rigs  partially offset by lower effective interest rates in the second half of due to the issuance of the zero coupon convertible debentures in june the company capitalized interest expense of million in in connection with the construction of its new rigs 
the company capitalized interest of million in and million in in connection with the construction of the glomar c 
r 
luigs and glomar jack ryan drillships 
interest income increased to million in  from million in and million in primarily due to higher average cash balances and short term investments in as compared to and in june  the company completed the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system to exxon neftegas limited for million  resulting in a pretax gain in the amount of million 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately in the rate takes into account global marine s operations for the full year and santa fe international s operations since the merger 
comparatively  global marine s effective tax rates were in and in the company s effective tax rate for was increased by a million net tax expense recorded to increase the valuation allowance against the nol carryforwards of global marine and its us subsidiaries 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of these nol carryforwards requires that the company achieve a certain level of future earnings in the united states prior to the expiration of its nol carryforwards 
reduced activity levels in the us gulf of mexico in contributed to a decrease in the expected future earnings of the company s us subsidiaries 
also  as a result of the merger  the expiration dates of the company s nol carryforwards were accelerated by one year  decreasing the number of years available to fully utilize the nol carryforwards before they expire 
the company s effective tax rate for was also increased as a result of the tax rate recorded on the gain on the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i  in june the company is a cayman islands company and is not subject to income taxes in the cayman islands 
consequently  income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income taxes imposed in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
the company s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as the company s operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
the company intends to permanently reinvest in the business of its us subsidiaries and their controlled foreign corporations all of their unremitted earnings 
as a result  the company has not provided for deferred taxes on billion of cumulative unremitted earnings at december  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax expense associated with these unremitted earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on earnings generated by assets operating temporarily in certain taxable jurisdictions 
in these circumstances  management expects that  due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling markets  the company s mobile assets will be redeployed to other locations to secure contracts in stronger markets 
therefore  management does not expect such mobile assets will reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences  thereby rendering inappropriate the recognition of deferred taxes 
should management s expectations change regarding the length of time a mobile asset will be used in a given location  the company would adjust deferred taxes accordingly 
the company believes the positions taken on its tax returns with regard to the taxability of its subsidiaries are reasonable  however  it cannot provide assurance that its positions will never be challenged or that  if challenged  the company would prevail 
transactions with affiliates in connection with the initial public offering of santa fe international  santa fe international entered into an intercompany agreement with kuwait petroleum corporation and sfic holdings  which agreement was amended in connection with the merger 
the intercompany agreement  as amended  provides that  as long as kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates  in the aggregate  own at least of the company  the consent of sfic holdings is required to change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary of the company or incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the rights or interests of kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates or reincorporate the company in another jurisdiction

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market value risk in the company entered into fixed price contracts with harland and wolff shipbuilding and heavy industries limited totaling million for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships  the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan 
pursuant to two year  capital lease agreements  the company subsequently novated the construction contracts for the drillships to two financial institutions the lessors  which now own the drillships and have agreed to lease them to the company 
the company has deposited with three large foreign banks the payment banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the lessors were required to make under the construction contracts  less a lease benefit of approximately million the defeasance payment 
in exchange for the deposits  the payment banks have assumed liability for making rental payments required under the leases and the lessors have legally released the company as the primary obligor of such rental payments 
accordingly  the company has recorded no capital lease obligations on its balance sheet with respect to the two drillships 
the glomar cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan began operating under contract in april and december  respectively 
the company has certain market interest rate risk exposure in connection with its fully defeased financing leases for the glomar jack ryan and glomar c 
r 
luigs 
the defeasance payment earns interest based on the british pound sterling three month libor  which approximated at the time of the agreement 
should the defeasance payment earn less than the assumed rate of interest  the company will be required to make additional payments to augment the annual payments made by the payment banks pursuant to the agreements 
if the december  libor rate of were to continue over the next eleven years  the company would be required to fund an additional estimated million during that period 
any additional payments made by the company pursuant to the financing leases would increase the carrying value of its leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in higher depreciation expense over their then remaining useful lives 
the company does not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under these leases would be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company also has other financial instruments  the market values of which are potentially sensitive to changes in market interest rates  including its short term investment portfolio  its fixed rate debt and its zero coupon convertible debt 
the objectives of the company s short term investment strategy are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as a result  the company s investment portfolio at december  consists primarily of high credit quality commercial paper  eurodollar debt securities and money market funds  all with original maturities of less than five months 
the company believes that the carrying value of these investments approximates market value at december  due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the estimated fair value of the company s million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of the company s million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of the company s million zero coupon convertible debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million 
the company does not consider its exposure to market interest rate fluctuations to be material to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company currently does not use financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk  however  the company closely monitors the relationship between any interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and may elect to use derivatives in the future 
foreign currency risk the company  through its international operations  is subject to foreign currency risk 
this risk arises from holding net monetary assets cash and receivables in excess of payables denominated in foreign currencies during periods of a strengthening us dollar 
the company attempts to minimize this currency risk by seeking international drilling contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to its estimated local currency based operating costs and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
due to this strategy  the company has minimized its net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
accordingly  the company has not entered into financial hedging transactions to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company may  however  enter into such transactions in the future should the company assume significant foreign currency risks 
credit risk the market for the company s services and products is the offshore oil and gas industry  and the company s customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require material collateral 
the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
the company s cash deposits were distributed among various banks in the areas of the company s operations throughout the world as of december  in addition  the company had commercial paper  money market funds  repurchase agreements  and eurodollar time deposits with a variety of financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
as a result of the foregoing  the company believes that credit risk in such instruments is minimal
