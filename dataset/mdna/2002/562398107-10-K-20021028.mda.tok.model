item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of securities act of as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  which statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not historical facts  are based on the company s beliefs and expectations as of the date of this report  and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in those forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those set forth below and the risk factors described in the company s other filings from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
general we are an integrator and reseller of computer hardware  software and networking products  primarily for commercial customers and a distributor of display technology solutions and plasma display monitors primarily to dealers and system integrators 
we offer our customers single source solutions  customized to their information systems needs  by integrating analysis  design and implementation services with hardware  software  networking products and peripherals from leading vendors 
to date  most of our revenues have been derived from product sales 
we generally do not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by us are loaded with prepackaged software products 
certain trends and uncertainties the computer industry is characterized by a number of potentially adverse business conditions  including pricing pressures  evolving distribution channels  market consolidation and a decline in the rate of growth in sales of personal computers 
heightened price competition among various hardware manufacturers may result in reduced per unit revenue and declining gross profit margins 
as a result of the intense price competition within our industry  we have experienced increasing pressure on our gross profit and operating margins with respect to our sale of products 
our inability to compete successfully on the pricing of products sold  or a continuing decline in gross margins on products sold due to adverse industry conditions or competition  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an integral part of our strategy is to increase our value added services revenue 
these services generally provide higher operating margins than those associated with the sale of products 
this strategy requires us  among other things  to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees in a competitive labor market  provide additional training to our sales representatives and enhance our existing service management system 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in increasing our focus on providing value added services  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
geographic issues 
our strategy also includes expanding our presence in the new york metropolitan area by increasing our sales and service capabilities in our new york city office and enlarging our sales  service and training capabilities at our long island headquarters  as well as expanding geographically into growing business centers in the eastern half of the united states 
we cannot assure you that the expansion of our new york metropolitan area operations will increase profits generated by such operations  that the opening of new offices will prove profitable  or that these expansion plans will not substantially increase future capital expenditures or other expenditures 
the failure of this component of our strategy may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  our revenues have been based primarily upon sales in the new york metropolitan area 
our strategy  encompassing the expansion of service offerings  the expansion of existing offices and the establishment of new regional offices  has challenged and will continue to challenge our senior management and infrastructure 
we cannot predict our ability to respond to these challenges 
if we fail to effectively manage our planned growth  there may be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
on september   the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in washington  dc were the subject of terrorist attacks 
a significant part of our business is generated from our new york city and baltimore washington  dc offices and revenues for the month of september were adversely impacted with declines in orders and shipments 
we cannot predict the impact that these or potential future attacks may have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
personnel issues 
the success of our strategy depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel and sales representatives  including independent sales representatives  in a very competitive labor market 
our ability to grow our service offerings has been somewhat limited by a shortage of qualified personnel  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such skilled personnel and representatives 
the loss of a significant number of our existing technical personnel or sales representatives  difficulty in hiring or retaining additional technical personnel or sales representatives  or reclassification of our sales representatives as employees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the computer industry is characterized by intense competition 
we directly compete with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors as well as with certain computer manufacturers that market through direct sales forces and or the internet 
the computer industry has recently experienced a significant amount of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions  and manufacturers of personal computers may increase competition by offering a range of services in addition to their current product and service offerings 
in the future  we may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
moreover  additional suppliers and manufacturers may choose to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force and or the internet rather than or in addition to channel distribution  and may also choose to market services  such as repair and configuration services  directly to end users 
some of our competitors have or may have  greater financial  marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than us 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential competitors 
vendor relationships and product availability 
our business is dependent upon our relationships with major manufacturers and distributors in the computer industry 
many aspects of our business are affected by our relationships with major manufacturers  including product availability  pricing and related terms  and reseller authorizations 
the increasing demand for personal computers and ancillary equipment has resulted in significant product shortages from time to time  because manufacturers have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of certain products to meet demand 
in addition  many manufacturers have adopted just in time manufacturing principles that can reduce the immediate availability of a wide range of products at any one time 
we cannot predict that manufacturers will maintain an adequate supply of these products to satisfy all the orders of our customers or that  during periods of increased demand  manufacturers will provide products to us  even if available  or at discounts previously offered to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers will not adversely change in the future 
our failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer  the deterioration of our relationship with a major manufacturer or our inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on may   the hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation merged 
manchester sold the products of both companies and we believe that we had strong relationships with both companies and continue to have a strong relationship with the merged company 
while we do not believe that there will be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as a result of this merger  there can be no assurance that such a material adverse effect will not occur 
certain manufacturers offer market development funds  cooperative advertising and other promotional programs to systems integrators  distributors and computer resellers 
we rely on these funds for many of our advertising and promotional campaigns 
in recent years  manufacturers have generally reduced their level of support with respect to these programs  which has required us to increase spending of our own funds to obtain the same level of advertising and promotion 
if manufacturers continue to reduce their level of support for these programs  or discontinue them altogether  we would have to further increase our advertising and promotion spending  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability has been affected by our ability to obtain volume discounts from certain manufacturers  which has been dependent  in part  upon our ability to sell large quantities of products to computer resellers  including value added resellers 
our sales to resellers have been made at profit margins generally less favorable than our sales directly to commercial customers 
our inability to sell products to computer resellers and thereby obtain the desired volume discounts from manufacturers or to expand our sales to commercial customers sufficiently to offset our need to rely on sales to computer resellers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changing technology  inventory risk 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introduction of new hardware and software products and services 
this may render many existing products and services noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
our continued success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the technological developments of new products and services and to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
our success will also depend upon our abilities to address the technical requirements of our customers arising from new generations of computer technologies  to obtain these new products from present or future suppliers and vendors at reasonable costs  to educate and train our employees as well as our customers with respect to these new products or services and to integrate effectively and efficiently these new products into both our internal systems and systems developed for our customers 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing product and service developments or enhancements in response to these technological changes 
our failure to respond effectively to these technological changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid product improvement and technological change characterize the computer industry 
this results in relatively short product life cycles and rapid product obsolescence  which can place inventory at considerable valuation risk 
certain of our suppliers provide price protection to us  which is intended to reduce the risk of inventory devaluation due to price reductions on current products 
certain of our suppliers also provide stock balancing to us pursuant to which we are able to return unsold inventory to a supplier as a partial credit against payment for new products 
there are often restrictions on the dollar amount of inventory that we can return at any one time 
price protection and stock balancing may not be available to us in the future  and  even if available  these measures may not provide complete protection against the risk of excess or obsolete inventories 
certain manufacturers have reduced the period for which they provide price protection and stock balancing rights 
although we maintain a sophisticated proprietary inventory management system  we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully manage our existing and future inventory 
our failure to successfully manage our current or future inventory may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
as a result of the rapid changes which are taking place in computer and networking technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  our product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change  with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
the computer industry has experienced rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers and peripherals 
in some instances  we have been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not continue to decline or that we will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
acquisitions 
our strategy envisions that part of our future growth will come from acquisitions consistent with our strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  once identified  to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us  or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
certain of these acquisitions may be of significant size and may include assets that are outside our geographic territories or are ancillary to our core business strategy 
quarterly variations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
quarterly revenue and operating results generally fluctuate as a result of the demand for our products and services  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies with improved features  the introduction of new services by us and our competitors  changes in the level of our operating expenses  competitive conditions and economic conditions 
in particular  over the last several years  we have increased certain of our fixed operating expenses  including a significant increase in personnel  as part of our strategy to increase our focus on providing systems integration and other higher margin and value added services 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
microsoft litigation 
most of the personal computers we sell utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought a successful antitrust action against microsoft  which could delay the introduction and distribution of microsoft products 
the potential unavailability of microsoft products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
information technology systems 
our success is dependent in part on the accuracy  proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems  including our business application systems  internet servers and telephony system 
the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems affects  among other things  our ability to conduct business with our customers  manage our inventory and accounts receivable  purchase  sell  ship and invoice our products efficiently and on a timely basis and maintain cost efficient operations 
while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats  including computer viruses and malicious hackers  we cannot guarantee that such steps will be effective 
if there is a disruption to or an infiltration of our information technology systems  it could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
stock repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock  which authorization is effective until the first board of directors meeting following the close of our fiscal year  unless earlier terminated by the board 
the extent to which the company repurchases its stock and the timing of such purchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations to be evaluated by the executive committee of the board 
the repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific number of shares  and repurchases pursuant to the program may be suspended or resumed at any time or from time to time without further notice or announcement 
there can be no assurance as to the effect  if any  that the adoption of the repurchase program or the making of repurchases thereunder will have on the market price of our common stock 
e commerce we utilize a website and electronic commerce system 
the site  located at www 
e manchester 
com allows both existing customers  corporate shoppers and others to find product specifications  compare products  check price and availability and place and track orders quickly and easily hours a day seven days a week 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  significant investments and improvements in our e commerce capabilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enhancing and increasing our business through our expanded internet presence

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  encourages all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  and goodwill impairments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  the company must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to the company s results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of related revenue or total revenue 
percentage of revenue for the year ended july  revenue products services cost of revenue products services product gross profit services gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue 
revenue decreased by million or to million for the year ended july  or fiscal from million for the year ended july  or fiscal revenue from the sale of products decreased by million or while revenue from service offerings increased by million or 
the decrease in product revenue is primarily a result of lower sales of personal computers and peripherals as a result of the overall slowdown in economic activity in general as well as the decline in corporate spending in the technology industry in particular in fiscal this was partially offset by increased sales of display monitors  primarily large screen flat panel displays by our electrograph subsidiary 
the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to the company s acquisitions of donovan and e 
track in fiscal as well as the growth in the sales of services to customers that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors 
gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the direct costs of products sold  freight and the personnel costs associated with providing technical services  offset in part by certain market development funds provided by manufacturers

gross profit decreased by million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit from product sales decreased by million or while gross profit from service offerings increased by million or 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of products increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  increased volume rebates received from manufacturers and certain large volume product purchases for which the company received discounts 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of services declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to lower utilization of technical personnel as well as increased sales of lower margin services that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is principally due to lower salaries and personnel costs of approximately  reflecting the cost reduction measures that have been instituted as a result of the of the overall slowdown in economic activity and the reduction in revenue  decreased bad debt expense of approximately  lower advertising costs of approximately  and lower depreciation and amortization costs of  these decreases were partially offset by higher telephone expenses of approximately  and increased rent expenses of approximately  as a result of the company s acquisitions in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income  net  declined by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is a result of lower cash balances available for investment  lower interest rates available in the marketplace and the company s receipt of insurance proceeds in fiscal not received in fiscal in fiscal the company received approximately  of proceeds in connection with a life insurance policy that it carried on a deceased employee  partially offset by approximately  in compensation benefits paid to the deceased employee s beneficiary principally under the terms of a deferred compensation agreement with the employee 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased from of pre tax income in fiscal to of pre tax income in fiscal this increase in fiscal is primarily the result of the company not having the benefit of the nontaxable life insurance proceeds received in fiscal as discussed in interest and other income above 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue 
our revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million for the year ended july  or fiscal the decline in revenue was and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  compared to the same quarters a year ago  respectively  reflecting the overall slowdown in economic activity in general as well as the decline in corporate spending in the technology industry in particular

service revenue increased by million  or  due to our continued focus on developing and selling value added services to our customers including significant growth in the sales of services to customers that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors 
gross profit

all other operating costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross profit decreased by million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of the decline in revenue discussed above 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of products increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of services declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of lower margin services that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors as well as reduced demand for higher margin consulting and network design services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is principally due to higher bad debts and depreciation and amortization costs as well as costs from our rochester office  which was opened in connection with the acquisitions of texport and ltg on march  these increases were partially offset by lower commission costs due to the lower revenue discussed above 
in addition  selling  general and administrative costs were lower in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal when compared to the same quarters a year ago  reflecting the cost cutting measures principally personnel costs that have been instituted as a result of the reduction in revenue 
interest and other income 
interest and other income  net  declined by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal principally due to lower interest rates earned on short term investments as well as lower cash balances available for investment 
other income  net in fiscal consists of approximately  proceeds received by the company in connection with a life insurance policy that it carried on a deceased employee  partially offset by approximately  in compensation benefits paid to the deceased employee s beneficiary principally under the terms of a deferred compensation agreement with the employee 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased from of pre tax income in fiscal to of pre tax income in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of nontaxable life insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal as discussed in interest and other income above partially offset by higher state and local income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents in fiscal have been internally generated working capital from profitable operations 
the company s working capital at july  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  after adding back non cash items  provided cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during such years  other changes in working capital provided used cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  resulting in cash being provided by used in operating activities of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances  as well as our investment in inventory  can fluctuate significantly from one period to the next due to the receipt of large customer orders or payments or variations in product availability and vendor shipping patterns at any particular date 
investment activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal used cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts include additions to property and equipment in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and the payment for acquisitions  net of cash acquired of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
financing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal used cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts include i proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options of approximately  and million  in fiscal and  respectively  ii net repayments of bank loans  capitalized lease obligations and other debt of approximately million   and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and iii the purchase and retirement of the company s common stock of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have available a line of credit with a financial institution in the aggregate amount of million 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under this line 
we believe that our current balances in cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the line of credit will be adequate to support current operating levels for the foreseeable future  specifically through at least the end of fiscal we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  other than operating leases that the company has committed to for its facilities and certain tangible property 
future capital requirements of the company include those for the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventory  the purchase of equipment  expansion of facilities  as well as the possible opening of new offices  potential acquisitions and expansion of the company s service and e commerce capabilities 
in addition  there are no transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity or the availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
the following represents the company s commitment under operating leases for each of the next five years ended july and thereafter thereafter the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may issue debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated investment 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets in the period in which they are incurred 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas effective august  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  while retaining the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of that statement 
sfas requires that a long lived asset to be abandoned  exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spin off to be considered held and used until it is disposed of 
however  sfas requires that management consider revising the depreciable life of such long lived asset 
with respect to long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  sfas retains the provisions of sfas no 
and  therefore  requires that discontinued operations no longer be measured on a net realizable value basis and that future operating losses associated with such discontinued operations no longer be recognized before they occur 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after december  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas as of august  the adoption of sfas did not have any material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas statements no 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
and technical corrections sfas 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements by rescinding statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in opinion will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
additionally  the statement requires that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas as of august  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas will spread out the reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after  because commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a liability for the anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit and disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and they will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas as of january  the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as no planned restructuring charges currently exist 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not exposed to significant market risk 
the company primarily invests its cash in mutual funds consisting of us government and government agency securities  municipal bonds and corporate fixed income securities 
neither a basis point increase nor decrease from current interest rates would have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
