item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in november  vaxgen was formed to continue development of aidsvax 
at that time  genentech licensed to us the technology necessary for completing development and commercialization of aidsvax under the genentech license agreement 
currently  genentech owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
since our formation  we have focused on developing and testing aidsvax 
we have developed formulations of aidsvax  which focus on the predominant hiv subtype in north america  europe  the caribbean  and australia subtype b and the predominant hiv subtype in southeast asia and east asia subtype e 
we have commenced two phase iii clinical trials  one in north america and europe and one in thailand  to determine the efficacy of aidsvax 
in october  we completed the initial inoculation and enrollment of over  trial volunteers for the north american european phase iii clinical trial  which is being conducted in clinical centers 
in august  we completed the initial inoculation and enrollment of over  volunteers for the thai phase iii clinical trial  which is being conducted in clinical centers in bangkok 
to date  we have generated  in revenue from grants from the national institutes of health nih for research and development of hiv vaccines along with funds received through a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech research laboratories  inc  which is funded by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  to obtain and store clinical specimens from our north american european phase iii clinical trial 
under the agreement with bbi biotech  we will receive a gross amount of approximately  as reimbursement of direct costs incurred and costs related to our clinical sites 
we have recognized approximately  for the year ended december  we anticipate only modest revenues from other governmental agencies or other grants or from collaborations with other entities over the next three to four years 
we have incurred losses since inception as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of  we anticipate incurring substantial losses over at least the next three to four years as we complete our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our vaccines and expand our operations 
the interim analysis of our north american european trial was conducted in the fourth quarter of the data and safety monitoring board dsmb conducted an interim analysis of efficacy using data from the north american european clinical trial and recommended that the study continue to its planned conclusion at the end of the dsmb could have recommended concluding the trial prematurely if the vaccine had proven effective ahead of schedule 
we anticipate that the interim analysis for the thai clinical trial will be conducted during the fourth quarter of if there is conclusive evidence indicating that the vaccine is efficacious  the dsmb could recommend that the trial be halted early and we would begin the process of applying for a license to market the vaccine 
if the analysis from this trial were inconclusive  the dsmb would recommend that we continue the trial to its scheduled conclusion in critical accounting policies and estimates we currently believe that none of our accounting policies or estimates are critical 
however  as the nature and scope of our business operations mature  certain of our accounting policies and estimates may become critical 
you should understand that generally accepted accounting principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods covered by our financial statement  the actual amounts of these items could differ materially from those estimates 
for example  we estimate the fair value of stock options and warrants issued to nonemployees using an option valuation method that considers market indicators 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  contract revenue in primarily consisted of funds received as reimbursements under a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech that is funded by niaid 
research contract revenue earned in one period is not indicative of research contract revenue to be earned in future periods 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a reduction of  in fees paid to genentech for clinical material as a result of the trials winding down along with lower clinical site costs  laboratory supplies and fees paid to third parties associated with conducting the clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a  non cash compensation charge in related to the issuance of common stock to three executives in connection with the achievement of a bonus provision in their employment contracts  offset by higher infrastructure costs along with an increase of approximately  in legal fees related to business development and the resolution of an employee matter 
other income  net other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  along with lower yields 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from in december  contract revenue consisted of  received from nih for a preparedness grant along with  received as reimbursements under another nih grant 
research contract revenue earned in one period is not indicative of research contract revenue to be earned in future periods 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase of  in fees paid to genentech for increased clinical material and research and development services provided offset by a reduction in recruiting costs for the two phase iii clinical trials  since the north american european trial was fully enrolled in october and the thai trial was fully enrolled in august general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to non cash compensation expense for the issuance of common stock to three executives in connection with the achievement of a bonus provision in their employment contracts along with modification of the terms of options in connection with the separation agreement of a former executive 
additional increases consisted of salaries and benefits associated with additional personnel hired to support the growing infrastructure  costs related to an executive s separation agreement and higher legal expenses 
other income  net other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  as a result of the initial public offering and a private placement of the company s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were  at december  we have financed our operations since inception primarily through capital provided by genentech and sales of our common stock 
genentech has no obligation to provide future funding to the company 
we completed our initial public offering in july  in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds to us in the amount of  of the aggregate proceeds received in the offering  approximately  was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses related to the offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  in early  we received net proceeds of  from private placement financing activities  which were completed prior to our initial public offering 
in december  we completed a private placement of common stock with vulcan ventures  inc the funds from the private placement help support our on going operations along with our current clinical trials 
this private placement has also enabled us to commence development of a formulation of aidsvax  that focuses on the predominant hiv type found in africa  china  india and south america subtype c 
currently  we have developed formulations of aidsvax  that focus on the predominant hiv type in north america  europe  the caribbean and australia subtype b and the predominant hiv subtype in southeast asia and east asia subtype e 
the private placement consisted of approximately  shares of common stock  which resulted in proceeds  net of expenses  to us of approximately  on may  we completed a preferred stock financing through which four investors paid us an aggregate of approximately  in consideration for  shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock at a price of  per share  convertible into shares of our common stock  at an initial conversion price of per share 
in the event that there is no earlier conversion  we must redeem the preferred stock for cash on may   at a redemption price equal to  per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
expenses relating to the transaction were approximately  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  the proceeds from the preferred stock financing will be used to prepare our hiv aids vaccine  aidsvax  for commercial scale manufacturing if it proves effective  the potential development of new adjuvants and general corporate purposes 
in connection with the preferred stock financing  we issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock to our preferred stock investors 
the warrants  which expire on may   have an initial exercise price of per share  subject to a one time possible downward adjustment on may   but not below per share 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and sales of investment securities  have consisted entirely of equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
from inception through december   our gross investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was  the increase in equipment and leasehold improvements has been primarily due to the development of our research and development laboratory and the establishment of larger office facilities 
net cash used in operating activities for was  representing expenditures for research and development costs and general and administrative expenses 
in october  we entered into collaboration with the federal centers for disease control and prevention cdc to support research at six of the clinics in the united states currently conducting phase iii clinical trials of our aidsvax vaccine 
the participating sites will continue to implement our phase iii protocol  as well as conduct epidemiological  social and behavioral research  which will be shared by the company and the cdc 
the sites will be compensated directly by the cdc for the clinical costs  which would have been incurred by the company  and for conducting the additional research 
the cdc has agreed to contribute approximately  to the participating sites over a four year period 
in  we finalized a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech  which is being funded by the niaid  an agency within the national institutes of health  to obtain and store clinical specimens from our north american european phase iii clinical trial 
the project is being funded under a contract  which niaid awarded bbi biotech for seven years 
under a subcontract with bbi biotech  we will receive a gross amount of approximately  to support the establishment of the sample collection 
we recognized approximately  for the year ended december  if aidsvax proves successful in our phase iii clinical trials  the samples will be used to determine if the vaccine induced a cellular immune response in the volunteers who received the active vaccine 
in  we were awarded a grant from the nih to continue the development of a vaccine designed to prevent infection by hiv subtype c  the most widespread form of the virus 
the small business innovation research fast track grant provides up to  for the development program 
we received approximately  for the year ended december  the nih grant will allow us to create and conduct laboratory tests of a subtype c vaccine that could be used alone in southern africa and india  or it could be combined with a vaccine against the b and e subtypes for regions of the world  such as china  where all three subtypes are in circulation 
in february  we and a group of south korean investors announced the formation of a joint venture  named celltrion  which intends to raise up to approximately million  consisting of up to approximately million in cash and an in kind investment of cell culture technology and production support valued at a minimum of million  to build and operate a facility in incheon  south korea  to manufacture aidsvax 
the joint venture also intends to fund construction of a smaller facility in the south san francisco  california area to support licensure and commercial launch of aidsvax 
we believe that both facilities  once constructed  will be used for commercial manufacture of aidsvax  if it proves safe and effective and is approved by the fda 
we will provide mammalian cell culture technology and biologics production expertise to the joint venture  in exchange for an initial interest in the joint venture 
we currently are celltrion s single largest shareholder 
after three planned rounds of financing  our fully diluted ownership will be approximately 
the south korean partners will provide the funding necessary to design and construct both facilities and to validate and operate the incheon facility 
we will provide the funding necessary to validate and operate the south san francisco area facility 
future payments due under lease obligations and other commitments as of december are as follows non cancelable operating leases clinical trial expenses total and thereafter   total    we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  together with investment income along with funds from other potential collaborative arrangements  will enable us to meet our forecasted expenditures through the anticipated completion of our north american european phase iii clinical trial and into the second half of however  we may need to raise additional funds to complete the thai phase iii clinical trial and we would need to raise additional funds to support the necessary manufacturing and development programs if we apply for regulatory approval of the vaccine 
we will also need to raise additional capital if the phase iii clinical trials are delayed or more costly than currently anticipated  or to continue operations if the phase iii clinical trials are not successful  or if commercialization is delayed for any other reason 
our future capital requirements are also dependent on several other factors  including the progress of other internal research and development projects  the need for leasehold improvements to facilities and the purchase of additional capital equipment  the ability to attract and negotiate business development opportunities  and the timing of revenue  if any  from aidsvax 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds when needed  or that such funds will be available on satisfactory terms 
we expect that our ability to raise additional capital will be adversely affected if aidsvax does not achieve clinical success 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  to offset any future federal taxable income 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in we also had research and experimentation federal income tax credit carryforwards at december   of approximately  new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
as the adoption of sfas no 
is prospective we can not predict the impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our exposure to market rate changes is related primarily to our debt securities included in our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
by policy  we invest in debt instruments of the us government  federal agencies and high quality corporate issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may decrease due to changes in interest rates or due to losses we may suffer when securities decline in market value 
at december   we held government debt instruments and corporate obligations in the principal amount of  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
our exposure to losses as a result of interest rate changes is managed through investing primarily in securities that mature in a period of one year or less 
we have exposure to foreign exchange rate risk primarily related to our conducting clinical trials in thailand 
thailand is currently considered an emerging economy 
a material increase in the value of thailand s currency against the us dollar could cause an increase in our expenses 
the majority of our contracts associated with conducting clinical trials in thailand are priced in baht 
as of december   we have incurred  in foreign exchange gains
