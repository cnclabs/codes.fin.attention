item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
dollars reported in thousands  except per share data 
basis of financial statement presentation we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of human antibody based therapeutic products using our proprietary technology platform  the ultimab human antibody development system 
this unique combination of human antibody technologies enables us to rapidly create and develop high affinity  fully human antibodies to a wide range of potential disease targets for therapeutic antibody products  including products for the treatment and or diagnosis of cancer  inflammation  auto immune and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
through our acquisition of genpharm international  inc and our collaboration with kirin brewery co 
ltd  we expanded our business to include both our humab mouse and kirin s tc mouse technologies 
in december we unveiled the km mouse  a unique crossbred mouse developed in partnership with kirin  as the newest addition to our ultimab human antibody development system 
with the ultimab platform  we have assembled a unique family of human antibody technologies for creating the entire spectrum of high affinity  fully human antibodies 
we intend to leverage our product development capabilities with those of our partners  while also gaining access to novel therapeutic targets and complementary development  sales and marketing infrastructure 
as of march   pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have partnered with us to jointly develop and commercialize products or have otherwise acquired the rights to use our proprietary technology in their development of new products  including industry leaders such as amgen  inc  centocor  inc 
a subsidiary of johnson johnson  eli lilly company  human genome sciences  inc  immunex corporation  novartis pharma ag  novo nordisk a s  and schering ag 
some of these are licensing partnerships  providing us with licensing fees  milestone payments and royalty payments  others are collaborative partnerships and provide for the sharing of product development costs  revenues  expenses and profits associated with products sold commercially 
our licensing partners typically obtain licenses to one or more of our antibody generating technologies which allow these partners to develop and commercialize antibody based products 
we could receive license fees  milestones and royalties in connection with each of these products 
under these licenses  there is usually an initial period during which our corporate partner may elect to enter into a research license for antibodies to a particular designated target 
subsequently  our licensing partner may elect to obtain a commercial license for monoclonal antibodies to a particular target 
as of december   of our total partnerships were licensing partnerships  and we expect to continue adding additional licensing partnerships in the future 
we are also pursuing an applied genomics strategy in order to gain access to new target antigens as they are identified  while also sharing the risks and rewards of the related antibody development and commercialization 
to this end  we have established a number of collaborative partnerships with leading companies in the fields of genomics and proteomics to jointly develop and commercialize human antibody products 
typically  our collaborator will provide a target antigen  and we will generate antibodies against that antigen using our ultimab human antibody development system 
we and our collaborators typically agree to share equally costs of clinical development and manufacturing as well as revenues  expenses and profits associated with the products 
as of december   of our total partnerships were collaborative partnerships  and we expect to continue adding additional collaborations in the future 
revenue our revenue is principally derived through licensing our human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of these agreements typically include potential license fees and a series of milestone payments commencing upon initiation of clinical trials and continuing through commercialization 
these payments may total  to  per product if the antibody receives approval from the fda and equivalent foreign agencies 
we are also entitled to royalties on product sales 
additional revenue is earned from the sales and  in some cases  manufacturing  of antibodies to corporate partners and from government grants 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  facilities  preclinical and clinical trials and supply expense relating to antibody product development and to the breeding  caring for and continued development of our humab mouse and km mouse  as well as to the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facility  travel  legal fees and other expenses relating to our general management  financial  administrative and business development activities 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been recognized pursuant to collaboration and license agreements with our partners 
revenue is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreements or when funds received are refundable under certain circumstances 
milestone and royalty payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of specific milestones 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with our collaborative partnerships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of the respective agreements 
investments all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
marketable securities will include those securities of debt and publicly traded equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
these securities trade on listed exchanges  therefore  fair value is readily available 
these securities are also subject to impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in addition  we make strategic investments in the equity of companies that are privately held  and these securities are carried at original investment cost 
because these securities are not listed on a financial exchange  we value of these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies  financial statements  and other external sources 
based on the information  acquired through these sources  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse changes in operating results of underlying investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  may also require an impairment charge in the future 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for  and were principally derived from our contract and licensing activities 
total revenues in of  included a  milestone payment from centocor which holds exclusive commercial licenses to develop humab mouse antibodies to four licensed targets 
in addition  the revenue included payments pursuant to license agreements and sales with merck kgaa of  revenues for of  increased by  or over the increase relates principally to contract and license revenues of  from kirin   from idm and  from scil biomedicals  offset in part by milestone payments from centocor for certain exclusive commercial licenses 
revenue for of  increased by  a increase from the increase relates principally to an increase of  of contract and license revenues from idm and an increase of  of sales  contract and license revenues from genmab 
our cost of sales were  in  an increase of  or over the increase was due to higher production of humax cd that was sold to genmab 
cost of sales were in  a decrease of  or decrease compared to despite comparable sales 
the decrease primarily reflects a lower unit production cost of humax cd research and development expenses are largely comprised of personnel costs  those expenses related to facilities for our clinical research  development and clinical trial manufacturing efforts  third party research costs and supply costs 
we have incurred research and development expenses for our products in development of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our total research and development costs from inception to date are  research and development expenses in increased by  or over research and development expenses in increased by  or increase over the increases relate primarily to costs associated with the following 
personnel costs for the year ended december  increased by  or over personnel costs for the year ended december  increased by  or over the increase in staff is to support higher levels of product development and clinical trial manufacturing activities  the continued development of our ultimab system  and the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners and clinical activities 
included in the increase are salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to increase further as we continue to increase our product development activities and progress our products in clinical trials 

facility costs for the year ended december  increased by or over facility costs for the year ended december  increased by  or over the increase in was due to substantial investments in our three research and development facilities 
such expenditures included building and land improvements  machinery and lab equipment  furniture and fixtures and other related costs 
as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in we expect facility costs to increase in future periods as a result of our continued capital expansion plans 

outside funding of research for the year ended december  increased by  or  over outside funding of research for the year ended december  decreased by  or as compared to in we paid a  upfront fee to eos biotechnology inc  under our binding letter of intent 
conversely  the decrease was principally due to the april refund of this  fee by eos as part of a restructuring of the collaboration 
we expect outside funding of research expenses  including funds paid to certain partners for research services  to increase in the future 

research supply costs for the year ended december  increased by or over research supply costs for the year ended december  increased by  or over included in these costs are materials and small equipment associated with the development of our products 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our research and product development activities 
we also expect expenses related to clinical trials to increase in the future as we continue to develop our therapeutic product pipeline 
as part of our partnering strategy  a significant portion of the research and development expenses incurred in connection with products using our technology is expected to be borne by our partners 
we believe this allows us to participate in the research and development of substantially more potential product candidates than we could develop on our own if we bore the entire cost of development 
products using our technology are currently in various stages of development from preclinical to phase iii 
the successful development of these product candidates is dependent on many factors  including among other things  the efforts of our partners  unforeseen delays in  or expenditures relating to  preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing or regulatory approval  failure to receive market acceptance  the emergence of competitive products and the inability to produce or market our products due to third party proprietary rights 
general and administrative expenses were  in  an increase of  or over the increase was primarily attributable to higher consulting and personnel costs incurred in connection with the expansion of our business activities and increased shareholder relation expenses 
included in these expenses are non cash charges for options issued to employees and options and warrants issued to consultants of  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were  in  an increase of  or over the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs  as well as higher legal and travel costs incurred in connection with the expansion of our business activities 
the increase was partially offset by lower consulting and shareholder relation expenses 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as our products are developed and we expand our business activities 
equity in net loss of affiliate of in reflects our share of genmab s loss for the year ended december  we were not required to include any of genmab s losses in equity in net loss of affiliate was  in  an increase of  over the increased loss reflects our share of genmab s loss for the full year 
this loss is primarily the result of genmab s increased activity in research and development and expansion of its business 
genmab is an affiliated company and is accounted for using the equity method see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect equity in net loss of affiliate to increase in the near future due to the genmab s proposed increase in research and development costs to develop its product pipeline 
interest and dividend income was  in  an increase of  or  over the increase reflects interest earned on higher average cash balances resulting from the proceeds received from the march  follow on public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares split adjusted and received net proceeds of approximately  interest and dividend income was  in  an increase of  or over the increase reflects interest earned on higher average cash balances as the result of proceeds received from the june  public offering of our convertible subordinated notes due in we anticipate lower investment income in the future as we liquidate our investments to fund operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense was in  a decrease of  or a decrease from interest expense was  in  an increase of  as compared to  which reflects accrued interest on the convertible subordinated notes issued on june  and due in interest is payable on january and july of each year beginning january  our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  of  consisted of  received from the sale of a portion of our new jersey net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards and research and development tax credits offset  in part  by a provision for state taxes 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  of  was partially due to our recording of an increased basis of genmab s assets from its initial public offering in october it consisted of  of deferred tax benefit and from the sale of new jersey state nols  offset  in part  by provisions for federal and state taxes and by current and deferred foreign withholding tax expense 
the deferred tax benefit related to deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance was necessary because an equivalent amount of deferred tax liability was established  related to an unrealized gain included in comprehensive income 
the tax benefit is principally derived from medarex s portion of the increase in the book value of the assets of genmab resulting from the proceeds genmab received upon completion of its initial public offering in october the current federal and state tax provisions for the year ended december  resulted from revenue that is deferred for financial reporting purposes but not for tax reporting purposes  and from limitation of the available federal nols 
after tax deductions related to exercises of stock options  no current federal or state taxes were payable at december  applicable accounting rules require recognition of tax benefits associated with these deductions through adjustment to additional paid in capital rather than through current tax expense 
our tax expense for the year ended december  of was the result of deferred foreign tax assets reversing in the current year 
there were no federal or state current tax benefits for the year ended december  we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public sales of our common stock  the issuance of subordinated convertible debt  contract and license revenues and research product sales 
in and  we raised a total of  from sales of our equity and debt securities 
at december  and  we had  and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
cash used in operating activities 
operating activities consumed   and  of cash for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our products are developed 
as we complete the expansion of our new research and development facilities  we will incur additional maintenance costs such as utilities  property taxes and engineering charges 
moreover  we also plan to spend significant amounts to develop  on a proprietary or co developed basis  inds for as many as ten product candidates a year 
to a lesser extent  we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we expand our administrative and business development activities 
our operating expenditures will only be partially offset by revenues from partners for license fees  milestone payments  development and manufacturing services and earnings received on our investments 
going forward  we anticipate lower investment income due to lower average cash balances  resulting from planned capital expenditures and the funding of future operating losses 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  in and  respectively 
such activities include equity investments in other companies as well as expenditures for property  equipment  construction in progress and other related costs 
it also includes net purchases of marketable securities with the funds we received from our follow on public offering in and our convertible subordinated notes issuance in during  we invested  in property  buildings and equipment 
in november  we acquired the milpitas  california facility that we had leased in april for approximately  this property contains approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space and  as of december   we had spent cumulatively approximately  on renovating this facility 
in january  we purchased a facility and adjacent land in bloomsbury  new jersey for approximately  the bloomsbury facility is situated on approximately acres of land and currently contains space for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space 
we currently are using  square feet as laboratory and office space 
as of december   we have completed the initial phase of the bloomsbury facility and have cumulatively expended approximately  in  we expect to expand our research facility in milpitas and continue the expansion of laboratory and development capacity in bloomsbury and annandale  new jersey 
we currently expect the costs for this expansion to be up to approximately  but this is subject to change 
cash provided by financing activities 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from the proceeds received from our june issuance of  convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of payable on january and july of each year 
the first interest payment was made on january  the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at a ratio of per each  principal amount of the notes per share  subject to adjustment 
the cost of issuance of the notes of approximately  has been deferred and is being amortized over the term of the notes 
such amortization is included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
we may redeem any or all of the notes at any time at specified redemption prices plus possible make whole payments as defined in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the notes will mature on july  unless earlier converted  redeemed at our option or redeemed at the option of the noteholder upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture for the notes 
in addition  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture from paying dividends  incurring debt  or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was  received primarily from the sale of our common stock in a follow on public offering 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  these nol carryforwards will expire in the years  if not utilized 
during we determined that an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurred during the effect of the ownership change is the imposition of a  annual limitation on the use of nol carryforwards attributable to periods before the change 
this annual limitation will result in the expiration of some nol carryforward credits before utilization 
at december  the amount of nol subject to the limitation was  and the amount not subject to limitation was  effective january  the new jersey division of taxation established a program that allows new or expanding technology and biotechnology businesses to sell their unused nol carryover and unused research and development tax credits to corporate taxpayers in the state for at least of the value of the benefits 
the current state tax provision benefit in and includes  and  respectively  for sales of portions of our nols and research and development tax credits 
there were no such sales during other liquidity matters 
in connection with our merger with essex medical products in  we issued promissory notes to essex chemical corporation in the principal amount of and committed to pay of our net after tax income until a total of  has been paid  contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
on june   we repaid the of notes  plus accrued interest to essex 
as the result of our net income in we accrued payable to essex  which remains accrued at december  at our option  this obligation may be satisfied by the payment of shares of our common stock having a fair market value equal to the amount owed  provided such shares are registered for sale with the sec 
in february  we entered into a binding letter of intent with eos to develop and commercialize genomics derived antibody based therapeutic products 
pursuant to the letter of intent  in may we paid  to eos and deposited an additional  in a third party escrow account  to be released over time upon the achievement of certain milestones 
this escrow deposit is included on our december  balance sheet as segregated cash 
in september  we also purchased shares of preferred stock of eos for an aggregate purchase price of  which was part of a  private placement 
in april  a new binding letter of intent with eos was signed which superceded the original letter mentioned above 
as a result of the restructured agreement  eos refunded the initial  plus in interest and we received the original  deposit plus  in interest from escrow 
in july  we entered into an agreement with idm whereby we licensed to idm certain of our technologies in exchange for equity units in idm 
as a result of this transaction  we realized a gain from the transfer of technology of approximately  based upon an independent valuation 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we will recognize this gain over a month period as contract revenue 
accordingly  at december   approximately  remains unrecognized and will be recorded as revenue during as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  and as set forth in the table below  in addition to its convertible subordinated notes  medarex is obligated under non cancelable operating leases as follows convertible subordinate operating total notes leases and thereafter   in addition  we have commitments for research funding and the use of a license for database products of approximately  in and approximately  per year thereafter through future liquidity resources 
our current sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest and dividends earned on such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  sales of our products for research  and contract and licensing revenue 
we believe that such sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operating  debt service  and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional financing within this time and may raise funds through public or private financings  line of credit arrangements  collaborative relationships and or other methods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have infinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we are currently reviewing the impact of statement no 
 which is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or statement  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
statement requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
since the requirement is to recognize the obligation when incurred  approaches that have been used in the past to accrue the asset retirement obligation over the life of the asset are no longer acceptable 
statement also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is increased at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
enterprises are required to adopt statement for fiscal years beginning after june  we are in the process of evaluating this statement and the effect that it will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement no 
supersedes statement no 
and identifies the methods to be used in determining fair value 
we are currently reviewing the impact of statement no 
and do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
however  we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
we may be exposed to exchange conversion differences in translating the foreign results of our investment in genmab to us dollars 
depending upon the relative strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  the conversion difference could be significant
