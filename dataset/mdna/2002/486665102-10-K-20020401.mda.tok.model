impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by the company are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
the company was able to increase its billing rates over its increases in direct labor costs in certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
keane s quarterly operating results have varied  and are likely to continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price of keane s shares 
keane has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
keane s gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed by keane during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence keane s revenue in a particular quarter  including 
general economic conditions which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  
the number and requirements of client engagements  
employee utilization rates  
changes in the rates keane can charge clients for services  
acquisitions  and 
other factors  many of which are beyond keane s control 
a significant portion of keane s expenses do not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  keane s operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of keane common stock 
in addition  many of keane s engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
keane has pursued  and intends to continue to pursue  strategic acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets may adversely affect keane s financial performance 
in the past five years  keane has grown significantly through acquisitions 
from january  through december   keane has completed nine acquisitions 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
keane s future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  keane may be in various stages of considering acquisition opportunities 
keane can provide no assurances that it will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that it will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
in addition  even if keane reaches a definitive agreement  there is no assurance that keane will complete any future acquisition 
keane typically anticipates that each acquisition will bring benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if keane can actually realize these benefits 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for keane 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs  expenses and liabilities 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into keane s existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which keane might otherwise devote to its existing business 
in addition  the process may require significant financial resources that keane might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of keane s existing operations 
finally  future acquisitions could result in keane having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and result of operations 
the complex process of integrating metro and signaltree solutions with keane may disrupt the business activities of the company and affect employee morale  thus affecting the company s ability to pursue its business plan and retain key employees 
integrating the operations and personnel of metro information services  inc  which keane acquired in november  and signaltree solutions  which the company acquired in march with keane is a complex process 
the integration of each of metro and signaltree solutions may not be completed in the expected time period or may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the successful integration of metro and signaltree solutions with keane requires  among other things  integration of finance  human resources and sales organizations 
the diversion of the attention of keane s management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business 
further  the process of combining metro and signaltree solutions with keane could negatively affect employee morale and the ability of the combined company to retain some of its key employees after the merger 
the inability to successfully integrate the operations and personnel of metro and signaltree solutions with keane could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and results of operations 
keane s growth could be limited if it is unable to attract personnel in the information technology and business consulting industries 
keane believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
keane may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop its business 
if keane does not  its business  financial condition and result of operations could be materially adversely affected 
keane faces significant competition for its services  and its failure to remain competitive could limit its ability to maintain existing clients or attract new clients 
the market for keane s services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  keane s competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of keane s competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than does keane 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development needs 
in the healthcare software systems market  keane competes with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than keane 
keane believes that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
keane may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by keane may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
keane conducts business in the united kingdom and india  which exposes it to a number of difficulties inherent in international activities 
as a result of its acquisition of signaltree solutions in march  keane has two software development facilities in india and has added approximately technical professionals to its professional services organization 
india is currently experiencing conflicts with pakistan over the disputed territory of kashmir as well as clashes between different religious groups within the country 
these conflicts  in addition to other unpredictable developments in the political  economic and social conditions in india  could eliminate or reduce the availability of these development and professional services 
if access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced  keane s ability to meet development objectives important to its new strategy would be hindered  and its business could be harmed 
if keane fails to manage its geographically dispersed organization  it may fail to meet or exceed its financial objectives and its revenues may decline 
keane performs development activities in the us and canada and soon will be in india  and has offices throughout the united states  the united kingdom  canada and india 
this geographic dispersion requires substantial management resources that locally based competitors do not need to devote to their operations 
keane s operations in the uk and india are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
keane may not be successful in its international operations 
keane may be unable to redeploy its professionals effectively if engagements are terminated unexpectedly  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
keane s clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with keane on short notice 
if they do so  keane may be unable to reassign its professionals to new engagements without delay 
the cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could  therefore  reduce the utilization rate of keane s professionals  which would have a negative impact on keane s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
keane believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and it expects that results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future
