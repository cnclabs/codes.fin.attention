except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described in the section titled risk factors beginning on page overview packeteer is a leading provider of application performance infrastructure systems designed to provide enterprises and service providers a layer of control for applications delivered across intranets  extranets and the internet

our products are built on hardware platforms based on intel compatible microprocessor technologies 
in addition  packetwise software is licensed by major communications industry partners who integrate the software into specific strategic networking solutions 
we primarily use indirect channels  resellers  distributors  system integrators and oems  to leverage the reach of our sales force and to obtain worldwide coverage 
our sales and marketing efforts are used to develop brand awareness and support our indirect channels 
we have subsidiaries in hong kong  japan  the netherlands  england  germany  france  denmark  australia  caymans and canada 
to date  we have shipped more than  units 
we were incorporated in january from our inception through january  our operating activities related primarily to establishing a research and development organization  developing and testing prototype designs  establishing a sales and marketing organization and developing customer  vendor and manufacturing relationships 
we shipped our first product in february since then  we have focused on developing additional products and product enhancements  building our worldwide indirect sales channel and establishing our sales  marketing and customer support organizations 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to further the growth of our business  we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering on july   which raised approximately million net of fees and expenses 
we have a limited operating history 
we have incurred losses since we commenced operations in and profitability will be difficult to achieve and sustain 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses and  as a result  will need to generate significant quarterly revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  valuation allowances including 
table of contents sales return reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts  and other liabilities  specifically warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the items in our financial statements requiring the most significant estimates and judgment are as follows revenue recognition 
product revenue consists primarily of sales of our packetshaper  appvantage and appcelera products  which include hardware  as well as software licenses 
service revenue consists primarily of maintenance revenue and  to a lesser extent  training revenue 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software products 
revenue is generally recognized when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distribution channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier from packeteer or its designated fulfillment house 
for maintenance contracts  delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract period 
the company s fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangements 
the fee the company s customers pay for its products is negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  and is generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
this revenue recognition policy is modified under certain circumstances as follows product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as the company has established significant experience with the distributor s product return and exchange activity 
additionally  when the company introduces new product into its distribution channel for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of sell through to end user customers 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of its product and to training 
vsoe is based upon separate sales of maintenance renewals and training to other customers 
accordingly  assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken place 
to date  training revenues have not been material 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we currently contract with smtc for the manufacture of all of our products 
we record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and 
table of contents forecasted demand 
factors which could cause our forecasted demand to prove inaccurate include our reliance on indirect sales channels and the variability of our sales cycle  the potential of announcements of our new products or enhancements to replace or shorten the life cycle of our current products  or cause customers to defer their purchases  loss of sales due to product shortages  and the potential of new or alternative technologies achieving widespread market acceptance and thereby rendering our existing products obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the company regularly performs reviews to determine if the carrying value of its long lived assets is impaired 
the purpose for the review is to identify any facts or circumstances  either internal or external  which indicate that the carrying value of the assets cannot be recovered 
such facts or circumstances might include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
if quoted market prices for assets are not available  the fair value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value 
during the third quarter of  the company performed an assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to its acquisition of workfire technologies international  inc pursuant to the company s stated policy as described in note to the financial statements 
management s determination of the existence of impairment indicators included continued general economic slowing  broad based declines in the values of networking technologies and a review of current  historical and future projections of cash flows related to these assets 
the conclusion of the assessment was a determination that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets exceeded its fair value 
the fair value was determined based on company projections of the present value of future net cash flows to be generated over the expected lives of these assets 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of for the entire unamortized balance 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
any goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in the future will be tested for impairment on an annual basis according to the specific guidance in the statement 
sales return reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
when providing for sales return reserves  management analyzes historical return rates as it is the primary indicator for estimating future returns 
judgments and estimates must be made in connection with establishing the sales return reserve 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or used different estimates 
the sales return reserve liability balance at december  and was  and  respectively 
management must also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management reviews the aged receivables on an account by account basis  taking into consideration such factors as age of the receivables  customer history and projected or estimated continued credit worthiness  as well as general economic and industry trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
warranty reserves 
upon shipment of products to its customers  the company provides for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
the company s warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the 
table of contents reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the required reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality product in a timely manner and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software which could affect the functionality of our customer s network or mission critical applications 
to date  these problems have not materially adversely affected us 
warranty reserves amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
net revenues cost of revenues amortization of acquired technology gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill impairment of goodwill and intangibles amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses net loss from operations interest and other income interest and other expense net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss net revenues product revenues consist primarily of sales of our packetshaper  appvantage and appcelera products 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal product revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the increase from to was due to a more favorable product mix  with sales of our packetshaper edition models  introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  showing the largest growth in the increase from to was due to the increased number of units sold as a result of increased channel and market development and product acceptance 
service revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in due mainly to increases in the number of units on maintenance 
in fiscal and  one customer  alternative technology  inc  accounted for and of net revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of revenues in or no one 
table of contents customer accounted for or more of sales in sales to the top indirect channel partners accounted for  and of net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current value proposition  which enables our enterprise customers to get more value out of existing network resources and improved performance of their critical applications  combined with the anticipated economic recovery  should allow us to grow our business again in our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our product in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders and shipments  product mix  average selling price of our products and general economic conditions 
our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on continued growth in the application traffic and bandwidth solutions market  our ability to develop and maintain strong partnering relationships with our indirect channel partners and our ability to expand or enhance our product offerings or respond to technological change 
our growth in service revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of units on maintenance  which is dependent on both growing our installed base and renewing existing maintenance contracts 
our failure to successfully convince the market of our value proposition and maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners to ensure the success of their selling efforts on our behalf  would adversely impact our net revenues and operating results 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues excluding amortization of acquired technology consists of the cost of finished products purchased from our turnkey contract manufacturer and overhead costs 
our cost of revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the cost of revenues represented  and of net revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
the percentage decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to reductions in manufacturing and other product costs  specifically certain component costs  partially offset by increases in overhead costs  including service support costs 
the percentage increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in overhead costs  service support costs and other product costs 
product costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from to was due to increases in overhead costs  partially offset by reductions in manufacturing and other product costs 
the increase from to was due to an increase in units shipped as well as increasing overhead costs 
costs of service revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and  in fiscal the increases are due to the costs of developing the service support organization to support the increased installed base 
prior to fiscal  support activities were handled primarily by the sales organization 
to maintain our gross margins we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and enhancements and reduce product costs as we did in amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology relates to the acquired developed technologies of workfire technologies international  inc workfire 
the acquisition occurred in september there was no amortization during the second half of due to the impairment reduction discussed below under impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
the amortization of acquired technology was million during  compared to  in and none in research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of the packetshaper  appvantage and appcelera systems and packetwise software 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of   and  for the years  and  respectively  research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to 
table of contents fiscal was due to increases in staffing and related personnel costs  as well as increases in project related materials 
the increase in personnel related expenses was due to the inclusion of workfire for all of fiscal  compared to only three and one half months in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in personnel  consulting and related overhead costs 
research and development expenses represented  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the level of research and development spending varies depending on both the breadth of the company s research and development efforts and the stage of specific product development 
as of december   all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product and cost reduction objectives 
we intend to continue to invest in appropriate projects related to the enhancement of our product offerings and expect expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses for those engaged in the sales  marketing and support of the product as well as related trade show  promotional and public relations expenses 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of   and million in  and respectively  sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the increases in both fiscal and fiscal reflected the hiring of additional personnel in connection with building our sales force  and channel and increased marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of net revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in appropriate sales and marketing campaigns and therefore expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar expenses to increase in the future 
we continue to work towards our long term business model target showing sales and marketing expenses in the range of to of revenues  but do not expect to achieve this on a quarterly basis for at least the next eight quarters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses
