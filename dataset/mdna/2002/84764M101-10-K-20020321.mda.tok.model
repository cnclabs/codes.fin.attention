we also occasionally resell hardware products made by third parties  including products such as voice processing equipment that run our software  as well as facilities management services that are provided by third party call centers

our cost of revenue consists of the cost of our product licenses  cost of professional services  and cost of resold hardware and services  including speechsite hardware  and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product licenses consists of royalties that we pay to massachusetts institute of technology and international business machines that is equal to a percentage of our product license revenue for automated speech recognition and certain text to speech products  respectively 
this amount as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in cost of professional services revenue consists of our direct labor and related benefits costs  taxes and project specific travel expenses 
cost of other revenue consists of the cost of third party hardware  which we resell  and payments to the third party providers of outsourced facilities management services and speechsite hardware 
amortization of purchased technology represents the write off of technology acquired in the purchase of eloquent technolgoy  inc eti 
these technologies are being amortized over their expected useful life of months 
our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses  sales commissions and travel expenses  along with other marketing expenses  including advertising  trade shows  public relations  direct mail campaigns  seminars and other promotional expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for our personnel and  to a lesser extent  independent contractors  who work on new products  enhancements to existing products and the implementation of our products in new languages 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for our administrative  financial and information technology personnel  occupancy and overhead expense  and company wide professional fees  including recruiting  legal and accounting fees  as well as increases to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our non cash stock compensation charges result from non cash charges for options issued with exercise prices that are less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of warrants issued to non employees 
we receive interest income by investing the proceeds that we raised in our prior equity financings and our initial public offering 
interest expense is incurred primarily from amounts we owe under our line of credit and capital lease lines of credit 
due to our operating losses  we have recorded no provision or benefit for us federal or state income taxes in relation to these losses for any period since our inception 
during and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  and  respectively  representing amounts owed in foreign jurisdictions related to income of our foreign operations 
as of december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which expire beginning in our ability to use these net operating losses in future periods is not sufficiently assured and therefore  these tax assets carry no value on the balance sheet 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our critical accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates are as follows 
revenue recognition  
estimating valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  
acquisition accounting  and 
stock compensation accounting 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources product licenses  professional services  including maintenance and support  and the resale of hardware and facilities management services 
we sell product licenses either directly to clients or through third party distribution channels 
to support the sale  installation and operation of our products  we also provide professional services  consisting of developing custom software applications  user interface design consulting  project management  training  maintenance and technical support 
we resell hardware products provided by third parties  including products such as voice processing equipment that run our software  as well as facilities management services that are provided by third party call centers 
we expect the resale component of our total revenues to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues over time 
we only resell hardware or facilities management services when clients expressly request that we do so and therefore  such revenue is considered other revenue 
our typical customer arrangement includes a signed contract between the customer and us in which we generally offer payment terms ranging from to days  no rights of return of delivered products and a limited warranty period of to days based on agreed product specifications 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software  provided that no significant obligations remain  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  as follows 
when we license our software and do not provide any professional services  we recognize the license revenue when we ship the software to the client 

when oem s license our software  we receive a royalty 
we recognize the revenue from these royalties upon delivery to the third party when such information is available  or when the oem notifies us of the sale 

when we license software in connection with custom software applications developed by us  we recognize the revenue over the life of the development project  concurrent with any related services fees as described below 
typically  we do not consider professional services  other than the development of custom software applications  to be essential to the functionality of the other elements of our software arrangements 
the other professional services are limited and primarily include training and feasibility studies 
we recognize the revenue from professional services  provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  as follows 
when we provide professional services for a fixed fee  we recognize revenue from the fees for such services and any related software licenses as we complete the project using the percentage of completion method 
we determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours we have incurred to date to our estimate of the total labor hours required to complete the project based on regular discussions with our project managers 
this method is used because we consider expended labor hours to be the most available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates a loss  such loss is provided for in its entirety 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 

when we provide services on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as we perform the services  based on actual time incurred 

when we provide support and maintenance services  we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the related contracts  typically one year 
our sales frequently include  under related contracts  software licenses  related professional services and a maintenance and support arrangement 
the total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and support arrangement based on its fair value  equal to its stated list price as a fixed percentage of the related software product s price 
the remainder of the total contract value is then attributed to the software license and related professional services  with the effect that discounts inherent in the total contract value are attributed to the software license and related professional services 
for revenue classification  we allocate the contract value remaining after allocation to maintenance and support using the fair value of professional services  based on the fee charged when services are sold separately  and record that as professional services revenue  all remaining amounts are recorded as product license revenue 
under our maintenance and support arrangements  we offer unspecified upgrades and enhancements on software products only on a when and if available basis 
typically  we do not contract in advance for specified upgrades  enhancements or additional software products 
in arrangements where we agree to provide additional products  specified upgrades or enhancements  we allocate revenue from the entire arrangement among all elements of the order  including future deliverables  based on the relative fair values when products are sold separately  of each element of the arrangement 
we defer recognition of revenue allocated to the specified future deliverable until delivery has occurred and any remaining contractual terms relating to that element have been met 
in situations where fair value does not exist for all elements to be delivered under the arrangement  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the date when all elements have been delivered or fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we do not offer rights of return to our customers 
in situations where negotiated contracts require rights of return  we do not recognize revenue until all significant obligations have been delivered and accepted by the client 
when we resell hardware  we recognize the revenue when we deliver the hardware 
we recognize the revenue from resold facilities management services in the period that the services are provided 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer by reviewing credit reports from dun and bradstreet  as well as bank and trade references 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of any uncollectibility of our accounts receivable resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
management analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record the allowance for doubtful accounts on a specific identification basis 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates after entering into a revenue arrangement resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments beyond that estimated by management  additional allowances may be required 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in assessing the collectibility of customer transactions 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  acquisition accounting 
in january  we acquired eloquent technology  inc eti for total consideration of million which was allocated to net tangible assets and liabilities acquired of  completed technology of millon and goodwill of million 
the fair value of the completed technology was determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows from the sale of the completed technology  including the assumption that we would generate enough revenue from the licensing of this technology to meet the minimum royalty payments owed to ibm under a development and royalty agreement 
actual results during the year ended december  were consistent with our estimated cash flows 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology would be five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
stock compensation accounting 
in connection with the grant of certain options to employees and directors through june   we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
additionally  on august   in connection with the sale of common stock in private placements to netphone and america online aol  concurrent with our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million 
this amount represents the difference between the price of the public offering of per share and the price paid by netphone and aol of per share 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized to the statement of operations over the three year term of the concurrently entered arrangements 
in each reporting period  such amortization is reflected as a reduction of revenues resulting from the arrangements  to the extent that the amortization exceeds such revenues  the residual is reflected in operating expenses 
on june   we issued a fully vested warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock to aol in connection with a long term marketing arrangement 
in accordance with eitf  the estimated value of this warrant upon its issuance  utilizing the black scholes valuation model  was million  which is being amortized to selling and marketing stock compensation expense over the three year term of the agreement 
the warrant  which has an exercise price of per share  becomes exercisable upon the earlier of june  or in three equal installments upon the achievement of certain performance targets 
the warrant may be exercised at the option of the holder  in whole or in part  at any time on or before the fifth anniversary from the date that portion of the warrant becomes exercisable 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the proper valuation of deferred stock compensation related to employee stock options because at the time of grant there was no available market for our common stock 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the proper valuation of stock issued at below fair market values and warrants  as well as their useful lives 
different assumptions would have yielded materially different results 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total revenue 
year ended december  revenues product licenses professional services other revenues non cash stock compensation total revenues cost of revenues cost of product licenses cost of professional services non cash stock compensation all other expenses cost of other revenues amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenues gross profit year ended december  operating expenses selling and marketing non cash stock compensation all other expenses research and development non cash stock compensation all other expenses general and administrative non cash stock compensation all other expenses amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss comparison of years ended december   and total revenues

revenue from professional services 
revenue from fees we receive for professional services increased to million in from million in and increased in from million in the growth in revenue from professional services resulted primarily from the increased demand for custom speech applications from existing and new clients over these years and the growing maintenance revenue from an increasing installed license base 
other revenues 
other revenues totaled million  or of total revenue in  million  or of total revenue in and million  or of total revenue in the increase in other revenues from to resulted primarily from several clients that requested us to provide the hardware to host our software products sold to them 
other revenues decreased from to due to fewer customers purchasing hardware as part of the solution sold to them 
we anticipate that resold hardware and facilities management revenue will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues in the future 
non cash stock compensation offset to revenues 
in connection with the sale of common stock in private placements to netphone and america online  inc aol  concurrent with our initial public offering in august  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million 
this amount represents the difference between the price of the public offering of per share and the price paid by each of netphone and aol of per share 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized to the statement of operations over the three year term of the concurrently entered arrangements 
in each quarterly reporting period  such amortization is first reflected as a reduction of revenues resulting from the arrangements  to the extent that the amortization exceeds such revenues  the residual is reflected in operating expenses 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue from netphone and aol and  accordingly  the related amortization of million was recorded as a non cash stock compensation charge which reduced revenue

we anticipate that the royalty rate in the future will be higher based on the inclusion of ibm royalties  in addition to our mit royalties 
cost of professional services revenuse 
cost of professional services revenue increased to million in from million in and increased in from million in the increased costs from to are due primarily to the hiring of additional project managers  developers  user interface designers  speech scientists and technical support staff to expand our professional services organization 
this cost represented of professional services revenue in  in and in the decrease in cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenue from to reflects improvements in margins as certain lower margin projects were completed and replaced with higher margin projects

the purchase price of million has been allocated to net tangible assets and liabilities acquired of  completed technology of million and goodwill of million 
these intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis through december the amortization of the purchased technology totaled million in effective in january  statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that we discontinue amortizing acquired goodwill

these increases included the addition of employees in  employees in and employees in as a percentage of total revenues  our operating expenses were in  in and in non cash charges are also included in  and as noted below 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related travel costs for the selling and marketing personnel  along with spending on marketing activities  including advertisements  tradeshows  public relations activities and educational seminars 
these expenses increased to million in from million in and increased in from million in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues  were in  in and in the increases in selling and marketing expenses from to resulted primarily from our investment in sales and marketing personnel 
during this period  the number of sales personnel in north america increased from to and the number of employees in marketing increased from to in addition  the cost of engineers devoted to technical sales support  recorded as a selling expense  has increased steadily with increased sales 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses also reflects higher commissions associated with higher sales and increased marketing activities  including advertisements  tradeshows  public relations activities and educational seminars during these years 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will increase during at a slower rate than in  and that these expenses as a percentage of revenues will be less than for research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of labor costs and related travel for personnel involved in new product development and enhancements 
these expenses increased by to million in from million in and increased in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in the overall increase in research and development expenses from to resulted from increased hiring of software developers  quality assurance and testing personnel and speech scientists to develop and enhance our products

these expenses increased to million in from million in and increased in from million in the increases in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to additional infrastructure necessary to support our growing operations in the united states and internationally  an increase in professional services fees incurred to support our growth  increased recruiting costs  and the addition of senior level management to lead our growth 
due to the overall slowdown in the economy during  our rate of growth in our corporate infrastructure also slowed 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly during  and that these expenses as a percentage of revenue will be less than for non cash stock compensation 
non cash stock compensation charges are being recorded as a separate component of cost of professional services  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
in connection with the grant of certain options to employees and directors through june   we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair market value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant

on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of eloquent technology  inc eti  a supplier of speech synthesis  or text to speech technology 
the purchase price of million has been allocated to net tangible assets and liabilities acquired of  completed technology of million and goodwill of million 
goodwill represents the amount by which the total purchase price exceeded the fair value of acquired net tangible and intangible assets on the acquisition date

in addition  the parties agreed to collaborate in certain marketing efforts and additional technology development 
in connection with this agreement we recorded million for the acquired intellectual property and collaborative rights  equal to the fair value of the common stock issued  which is being amortized over a three year period 
amortization expense for the acquired intellectual property and collaborative rights was million in and million in interest and other income  net 
interest income was million in  million in and  in interest expense was  in   in and  in the increase in interest income from to was due to higher cash balances available for investing during and as a result of the initial public offering proceeds 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reduction in debt payable under our line of credit and capital equipment leases 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through july   we funded our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock totaling million and  to a lesser extent  through bank borrowings and capital equipment lease financing 
in august  we raised approximately million  before offering expenses  through completion of our initial public offering of common stock and the concurrent private placement of common stock with aol and netphone 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
our revolving line of credit  which expires on november   provides for available borrowings up to million  based upon certain eligible accounts receivable 
as of december   there was million available for borrowings under this line of credit  with million committed under the line of credit for outstanding letters of credit 
any amounts borrowed under this facility  would be due as of december  under the financing arrangement  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants related to total tangible net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
based on our financial projections  we believe that we will continue to meet the financial covenants required in the financing agreement 
our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in  million in and million in the operating cash outflows for these periods resulted primarily from our significant investment in research and development  sales and marketing and infrastructure 
to date  our investing activities have consisted primarily of net purchases of marketable securities of million in and million in and capital expenditures for property and equipment  including million in  million in and million in capital expenditures have consisted primarily of computer hardware  software and furniture and fixtures for our growing employee base 
we anticipate that investment in capital equipment will continue  similar to the rate of increase as seen between and for the next months 
in  we paid million  net of cash acquired  as part of the purchase price of eti and  was invested in another unrelated third party 
total investing activities used cash of million  excluding marketable securities investments of million  in  used cash of million  excluding marketable securities investments of million  in and used cash of million in in december  we entered into an equipment line of credit with a bank 
under this agreement  we obtained the right to borrow up to million to finance purchases of fixed assets 
borrowings under this line are collateralized by the fixed assets purchased and bear interest at the annual prime rate at december   which is payable monthly over a period of months 
during december  we borrowed million under this line with monthly payments beginning in january and ending december under the financing agreement  we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants related to total tangible net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
based on our financial projections  we believe that we will continue to meet the financial covenants required in the financing agreement

the term loan bears interest at an annual rate of prime plus at december   and principal and interest under the term loan are payable in monthly installments through september as of december    was outstanding under this facility 
our financing activities generated cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively

we had proceeds from bank borrowings of million  none and million during the same respective years 
repayment of bank borrowings and capital leases was   and  during  and  respectively 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of million shares of common stock 
the offering raised approximately million  net of offering expenses  for us 
concurrent with the initial public offering  we completed two private placements of common stock that raised an additional million 
as of the date of the offering  all outstanding shares of our preferred stock automatically converted into an aggregate of million shares of common stock 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placements  together with existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and borrowings available under our bank financing agreements  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
in the event we require additional financing  we believe that we would be able to obtain such funding  however  there can be no assurances that we would be successful in doing so or that we could do so on terms favorable to us

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas became effective for us on january  and requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangible assets into goodwill  the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets  the reclassification of certain intangible assets out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of adoption 
we are currently assessing and have not yet determined the impact of sfas with respect to any impairment of our goodwill 
as of january   we ceased amortizing goodwill 
quarterly amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  was approximately  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas supersedes sfas  however  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for segments of a business to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains apb s requirement that entities report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends the guidance of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued commencing with the first quarter of fiscal  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf  a committee of the fasb  reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf presumes that consideration  including equity instruments  from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products is a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
eitf is applicable for us as of january  upon adoption  reclassification of all prior period amounts is required to conform to the current period presentation 
we have previously issued equity instruments to certain of our customers 
upon adopting eitf on january   we will be required to reclassify the amortization of certain equity instruments issued to customers  which exceed amounts previously recognized as an offset to revenue 
the amounts that will be reclassified from selling and marketing stock based compensation expense to a reduction of revenue for the years ended december  and december  are  and  respectively 
based on the amount of revenue we recognize in the future  we expect that a portion or potentially all of the quarterly future amortization could be recorded against revenue 
during november  the eitf reached consensus on topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred topic d 
the eitf concluded in topic d that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the income statement with the offsetting cost recorded as costs of revenue 
out of pocket expenses generally include  but are not limited to  expenses related to airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  photocopies  and telecommunications and facsimile charges 
topic d is applicable for us as of january  upon adoption  reclassification of all prior period amounts is required to conform to the current period presentation 
we do not expect the adoption of topic d to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statements regarding forward looking information we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from such expectations include the timing of sales of our products and services  market acceptance of our speech activated systems  our reliance on a limited number of large orders for much of its revenue  uncertainties related to current economic  political and national security conditions  our ability to develop new products and services in the face of rapidly evolving technology  our ability to effectively integrate operations of any acquired companies  the uncertainties related to our planned international operations  our ability to manage growth of its business  our ability to protect our intellectual property  our reliance on resellers and original equipment manufacturers for a significant portion of our sales  our ability to respond to competitive developments  and our reliance on attracting  retaining and motivating key technical and management personnel 
these and other important factors are detailed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
as a result of these and other important factors  there can be no assurances that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a history of losses and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future that may depress our common stock price 
we had an accumulated deficit of million at december   and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
net losses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate higher revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
we cannot be certain we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
moreover  if we were to achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
any additional financing that we may require in the future may not be available at all or  if available  may be on terms unfavorable to us 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability may depress the market price of our common stock 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of financial analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock may decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of important factors are likely to cause these variations  including 
the timing of sales of our products and services  particularly in light of our dependence on a relatively small number of large orders  
the timing of product implementations  particularly large client design projects  
unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  
variation in capital spending budgets of our clients and potential clients  
increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  
deferral of recognition of our revenue in accordance with applicable accounting principles due to the time required to complete projects  
the mix of product license and services revenue  
the mix of domestic and international sales  and 
costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses 
because of the volatility of our quarterly results and the difficulty in predicting our future performance  our operating results may fall below the expectations of analysts or investors and  as a result  the price of our common stock may decline 
the slowdown in the economy has affected the market for information technology products  and our future financial results will depend in part upon whether this slowdown continues 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  demand for our products and services may be adversely affected 
many of our customers are in the telecommunications and airline industries  which have been strongly affected by the current economic downturn 
if the current economic conditions continue or worsen  our business may be harmed 
speech activated systems are relatively new products  and our success will depend on our ability to continue to educate prospective clients on the commercial viability of the products 
if our potential clients and their customers do not accept speech activated systems  our business will be harmed 
our business would be harmed if use of speech activated  e business solutions does not continue to develop  or develops more slowly than we expect 
our market is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
our future success depends on the acceptance by current and future clients and their customers of speech activated services as an integral part of their businesses 
the size of our market will depend in part on consumer acceptance of automated speech systems and the actual and perceived quality of these systems 
the adoption of speech activated services could be hindered by the perceived costs of this new technology  as well as the reluctance of enterprises that have invested substantial resources in existing call centers  touch tone based systems or internet based infrastructures to replace or enhance their current systems with this new technology 
accordingly  in order to achieve broad commercial acceptance  we will have to educate prospective clients  including large  established telecommunications companies  about the uses and benefits of speech activated services in general and our products in particular 
if these efforts fail  or if speech activated software platforms do not achieve broad commercial acceptance  our business could be significantly harmed and our revenues could decline 
in addition  the continued development of new and evolving wireless technologies using a visual web browser interface could adversely affect the demand for speech activated services 
we currently rely on a limited number of large orders for a significant portion of our revenues 
as a result  our inability to secure additional significant clients during a given period or the loss of one major client could cause our quarterly results of operation to suffer 
our stock price may also be adversely affected by unexpected quarterly revenue declines caused by delays in revenue recognition 
due to the nature of our business  in any quarter we are dependent upon a limited number of orders that are relatively large in relation to our overall revenues 
for example  one customer of ours accounted for of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in our speech activated products and services require significant expenditures by our clients and typically involve lengthy sales cycles 
we may spend significant time and incur substantial expenses educating and providing information to prospective clients 
any failure to complete a sale to a prospective client during a quarter could result in revenues and operating results for the quarter that are lower than expected 
in addition  as a result of the significant time required to deliver or perform a client order  we may be unable to recognize revenue related to a client order until well after we receive the order 
our dependence on large client orders and the delay in recognizing revenue relating to these orders makes it difficult to forecast quarterly operating results 
this could cause our stock price to be volatile or to decline 
if we fail to develop new products and services in the face of our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  on our ability to keep pace with 
rapidly changing speech recognition and speech synthesis technology  
evolving industry standards and practices  
frequent new speech activated service and product introductions and enhancements  and 
changing client requirements and preferences for their automated speech systems 
any delay or failure on our part in responding quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our existing speech activated products and services noncompetitive or obsolete and have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
we may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our speech activated products and services to respond to technological changes 
we must stay abreast of cutting edge technological developments and evolving service offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of our speech activated services 
we must be able to incorporate new technologies into the speech activated solutions we design and develop to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our client base 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and to respond to changing client requirements and preferences in a timely manner  we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers  which could result in a significant decline in our revenues 
development and commercial release of our new product line could impair our ability to sell existing product lines  and result in a decrease in associated services revenues 
the release of our openspeech tm products could have a negative effect on sales of our existing speech recognition products  including our speechworks product  and the prices we could charge for these products 
additionally  in the event of such a negative effect  the maintenance and support revenues associated with the sales of these products  as well as any potential consulting services revenues that would have been otherwise associated with certain sales of these products  may be delayed or impaired 
we may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current products in order to promote and support our new open speech product line 
this diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current products and services 
our application software may contain defects  which could result in delayed or lost revenue  expensive corrections  liability to our clients and claims against us 
we design  develop and implement highly technical speech activated solutions that are crucial to the operation of our clients products and businesses 
defects in the solutions we develop could result in delayed or lost revenue  adverse client reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services or require expensive corrections 
also  due to the developing nature of speech recognition technology and text to speech technology  our products are not currently and may never be accurate in every instance 
in addition  third party technology that is included in our products could contain errors or defects 
clients who are not satisfied with our products or services could bring claims against us for substantial damages  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages 
such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position 
our current and potential competitors in the speech activated solutions market  some of whom have greater resources and experience than we do  may offer products and services that may cause demand for  and the prices of  our products to decline 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete with our products 
competitors in the speech recognition and text to speech software market include at t  elan  fonix  ibm  lucent technologies  microsoft  nuance communications  philips communications  rhetorical  scansoft  and phonetic systems 
furthermore  we expect consolidation in our industry  and other companies may enter our markets by acquiring or entering into strategic relationships with our competitors 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the abilities of their advanced speech and language technology products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and or larger client bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop speech activated products and services comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends and standards or client requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than we do 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets  competition may intensify and future competition may cause demand for and the prices of our products to decline  which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
if the standards we have selected to support are not adopted as the industry standards for speech activated software  businesses might not use our speech activated software platform for delivery of applications and services  and our revenues could be negatively affected 
the market for speech activated services software is new and emerging and industry software standards have not yet been fully established 
we may not be competitive unless our products support changing industry software standards 
the emergence of industry standards other than those we have selected to support  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread usage  could require costly and time consuming redesign of our products 
if these standards become widespread and our products do not support them  our clients and potential clients may not purchase our products  and our revenues could be adversely affected 
multiple standards in the marketplace could also make it difficult for us to design our products to support all applicable standards  which could also result in decreased sales of our products 
we have and intend to continue expanding our international operations 
because of the risks involved with operating a business in foreign countries  we may not be successful and our business could be harmed 
our international sales represented of our revenue in  in and in we have recently expanded our direct and indirect international sales force with the expectation of increasing international revenues 
we have limited experience in international operations and international product and service sales  and there can be no assurance we will be successful in growing our international business 
we are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  any of which could harm our business 
these risks include 
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  
difficulties in establishing and maintaining an effective international reseller network  
the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  particularly with respect to intellectual property and license requirements  
political and economic instability outside the united states  
import or export licensing and product certification requirements  
tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries  
potential adverse tax consequences  including higher marginal rates  
unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and 
limited ability to enforce agreements  intellectual property rights and other rights in some foreign countries 
in order to increase our international sales  we must develop localized versions of our products 
if we are unable to do so  we may be unable to grow our revenue and execute our business strategy 
in order to expand our international sales  we intend to continue to invest significant resources to create and refine different speech recognition and synthesis models for particular languages and dialects 
these speech processing models are required to create versions of our products that understand or reproduce the local language or dialect 
if we fail to develop localized versions of our products  our ability to address international market opportunities and to grow our business will be limited 
in addition  we are required to invest resources to develop these versions of our products in advance of the receipt of revenues 
we may be unable to recognize revenues sufficient to render these products profitable 
growth in our operations may strain our resources  management information systems and controls  which may reduce our chances of achieving profitability 
we have recently experienced significant growth 
from december  to december  the number of our employees increased from to we intend to continue to expand our business operations in the future 
we will need to expand our management  operational  financial and human resources  as well as management information systems and controls  to support our anticipated future growth 
if we are successful  this growth may place a strain on the ability of our management team to execute our business plan 
in addition  we will be required to make significant investments in personnel  management systems and resources 
the expansion of these systems will place a significant burden on our management team and our information technology staff  and these systems may not be effective once implemented 
if we do not manage this growth  our business will suffer 
we rely on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect these rights  we may face increased competition 
protection of our intellectual property rights is uncertain and may be costly 
intellectual property rights are important in our industry 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality  assignment of rights to inventions  and or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate or strategic partners to protect our intellectual property rights 
these legal protections afford only limited protection and may be time consuming and expensive to obtain and maintain 
further  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be effective to prevent unauthorized use 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and trade secrets 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention away from our business 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions or investments in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions or investments could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions or investments may never be realized 
we may acquire or make significant investments in businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing business and technologies 
integrating any newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s time and attention away from our on going business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business  products  employees or technology successfully and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we cannot guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire or make significant investments in any businesses or technologies  which may result in dilution for stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness 
we may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably 
some of our customers and partners are newly formed businesses or businesses that are not yet profitable 
if these companies fail or experience financial difficulties  our business could be negatively affected 
some of our customers and partners are financed by investments from venture capital investors 
given the current general economic conditions and investment climate  these companies could face difficulties in securing additional financing to fund their operations 
if these companies are not yet profitable or self sustaining based on their operations  they could be unable to satisfy their commitments to us 
even if they are able to meet current obligations to us  they may not be able to buy additional products and services from us 
if these companies cannot meet their current obligations to us or fail  our business could be significantly harmed and our revenue could decline 
we may expend significant resources to defend against claims of infringement by third parties  and if we are not successful we may lose significant rights or be required to enter into disadvantageous license or royalty arrangements 
currently  in the software industry there are frequent assertions of patent infringement by owners of patents  and assertions of other violations of intellectual property rights such as trademarks  copyrights  and trade secrets 
in addition  there are a large number of patents in the speech processing area 
although we do not believe that we are infringing on any patent rights  the holders of patents may claim that we are doing so 
if any claim was made against us  our business could be harmed  particularly if we are unsuccessful in defending such claim 
if we are forced to defend any claim  whether it is with or without merit or is determined in our favor  then we may face costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  delays in future product releases or injunctions preventing us from selling our products and services 
we may also be required to enter into costly and burdensome royalty and licensing agreements 
any royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our products incorporate technology we license from others 
our inability to maintain these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
some of the technology included in or operating in conjunction with our products is licensed by us from others 
for example  we currently license certain text to speech technology from ibm  text to speech and other technology relating to computer processing of the human voice from at t and software and technology from mit 
certain of these license agreements are for limited terms 
if for any reason these license agreements terminate  we may be required to seek alternative vendors and may be unable to obtain similar technology on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain alternative license agreements  we could be required to modify some features of our products  which could adversely affect sales of our products and services 
we rely on resellers and original equipment manufacturers for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of one or more significant resellers or original equipment manufacturers could limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues 
in  of our revenues were attributable to our resellers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  especially intervoice brite  which accounted for of our revenues in we intend to increase our sales through resellers in the future 
as a result  we are dependent upon the continued success and viability of our resellers and oems  as well as their continued interest in selling our products 
the loss of a key reseller or oem or our failure to develop and sustain new reseller and oem relationships could limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues 
our contracts with our resellers and oems generally do not require them to purchase our products 
our resellers and oems are independent companies over which we have limited control 
our resellers and oems could cease to market our products or devote significant resources to the sale of our products 
any failure of our resellers or oems to successfully market and sell our products could result in revenues that are lower than anticipated 
in addition  our resellers and oems possess confidential information concerning our products and operations 
although we have nondisclosure agreements with our resellers and oems  a reseller or oem could use our confidential information in competition with us  which could adversely affect our competitive position and revenues 
we rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of senior management and key technical personnel 
moreover  competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be able to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could impact the management and development of our business 
our future success depends on our retention of a small number of senior management and key technical personnel  such as stuart r 
patterson  our president and chief executive officer  and michael s 
phillips  our chief technology officer and co founder 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers or key personnel could have a negative effect on our ability to grow our business 
we need to attract and retain managerial and highly skilled technical personnel for whom there is intense competition 
if we are unable to attract and retain managerial and qualified technical personnel  our operations could suffer and we may never achieve profitability 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired sales people fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
our financial success depends to a large degree on the ability of our direct and indirect sales force to increase sales 
therefore  our ability to increase revenue in the future depends considerably upon our success in recruiting  training and retaining additional direct and indirect sales personnel and the success of the sales force 
also  it may take a new salesperson a number of months before he or she becomes a productive member of our sales force 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries and branches 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in international markets where we transact business in foreign currencies and accordingly are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
substantially all of our revenues are invoiced and collected in us dollars 
net realized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense and have not been material to date 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income or loss 
we believe that the effect of any reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
