item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and legislation rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of dot  the occupational safety and health administration osha  and state regulatory agencies 
the stb  which is the successor to the interstate commerce commission icc  has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates  routes and services  the sale or abandonment of rail lines  applications for line extensions and construction  and consolidation or merger with  or acquisition of control of  rail common carriers 
the outcome of stb proceedings can affect the costs and profitability of bnsf s business 
dot and osha have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 
bnsf railway s rail operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
these laws cover discharges to waters  air emissions  toxic substances  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
this regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations 
environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
many of bnsf railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf railway is now subject and will from time to time continue to be subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on current and former owners and operators of a site 
accordingly  bnsf railway may be responsible under cercla and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to cleanup sites at which certain substances may have been released by bnsf railway  its current lessees  former owners or lessees of properties  or other third parties 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the business environment in which bnsf railway operates remains highly competitive 
depending on the specific market  deregulated motor carriers  other railroads and river barges may exert pressure on price and service levels 
the presence of advanced  high service truck lines with expedited delivery  subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non bulk  time sensitive freight 
the potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads 
in order to remain competitive  bnsf railway and other railroads strive to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity 
as railroads streamline  rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises  competition among rail carriers intensifies 
bnsf railway s primary rail competitor in the western region of the united states is union pacific railroad company up 
other class i railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by bnsf railway 
as a condition to approval of the merger up sp of rail carriers controlled by up and southern pacific transportation company sp  the stb in its decision required the grant to bnsf railway of trackage rights over approximately  miles of up sp track 
bnsf railway also purchased over miles of track from up sp as a result of the stb s decision 
bnsf railway and up compete head to head in gulf coast  intermountain and west coast markets served by these lines 
in  bnsf railway and up entered into an agreement to exchange half interests in the two pieces of the former sp rail line between houston and new orleans which were separately owned by the two railroads 
both railroads now have access to all customers  including chemical  steel  gas and other companies  along the entire line  including on former sp branch lines 
the stb approved the division of consolidated rail corporation conrail between csx corporation and norfolk southern corporation which was implemented in csx and norfolk southern operate the two largest rail systems in the eastern united states 
also  in  cn acquired illinois central corporation ic 
cn is canada s largest railroad and reaches the us cities of detroit and chicago  while ic had operations extending from chicago to the gulf of mexico and west through iowa 
in  cn acquired wisconsin central  a regional railroad with track and trackage rights in illinois  wisconsin  minnesota  michigan and the province of ontario 
item legal proceedings in september  bnsf railway was notified by the nebraska department of environmental quality of alleged environmental violations in connection with a november   derailment in scottsbluff  nebraska  that involved hazardous commodities 
if not resolved  this matter could result in litigation brought by the nebraska attorney general and monetary sanctions exceeding thousand 
bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters and personal injury claims 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available  it is the opinion of bnsf management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of bnsf  although  an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning certain pending administrative appeals with the internal revenue service

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of burlington northern santa fe corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries collectively  bnsf or company 
the principal subsidiary of bnsf is the burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf railway 
all earnings per share information is stated on a diluted basis 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  bnsf recorded net income for of million  or per share  after a first quarter extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  related to the early extinguishment of a debt obligation  compared with net income for of million  or per share 
the decrease in net income and earnings per share is primarily due to a million decrease in operating income and million in losses related to non rail investments 
the decrease in operating income reflects increased compensation and benefits costs  higher fuel expenses and higher materials and other costs  which included a million fourth quarter charge for workforce reduction related costs 
the favorable effect of the common stock repurchase program on earnings per share partially offset lower earnings in see liquidity and capital resources common stock repurchase program 
revenue table the following table presents bnsf s revenue information by commodity for the years ended december   and  and includes certain reclassifications of prior year information to conform to current year presentation 
average revenue revenues cars units per car unit in millions in thousands consumer products       coal         industrial products          agricultural products       total freight revenues          other revenues total operating revenues    revenues total revenues of  million for were essentially flat compared with in  the sluggish economy hampered bnsf s revenue growth  although  based on reporting to the association of american railroads aar  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic market remained essentially unchanged at approximately percent 
consumer products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  less than due to decreased loadings in the ltl sector and the loss in late of some automotive contract business as well as decreases in the automotive sector as a result of sluggish industry wide sales 
additionally  a significant automotive contract was lost at the end of the third quarter of and is expected to affect future automotive revenues 
these declines were partially offset by a ten percent growth in the intermodal truckload business  increased international revenues  increases in dry boxcar business due to strong beverage shipments  and a million favorable transportation contract settlement in automotive revenues 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million from revenues of  million 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of lower revenue per car on certain contract renewals  partially offset by a percent increase in coal tons shipped due to colder weather  tight eastern coal supplies and high natural gas prices 
industrial products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than  despite increased revenue per car as a result of selected price increases and increased length of haul 
revenues for the year fell due to continued production cutbacks affecting most sectors 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in the petroleum products sector resulting from increases in lpg and asphalt shipments 
agricultural products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  higher than revenues for primarily due to an increased demand for corn  soybean and oilseed meals  partially offset by a decline in fertilizer shipments 
additionally  average revenue per car increased due to increases in length of haul 
expenses year ended december  in millions compensation and benefits    purchased services    depreciation and amortization equipment rents fuel materials and other total operating expenses    interest expense other expense income  net total operating expenses for were  million  an increase of million  or percent  over primarily due to i increased compensation and benefits of million related to higher wages and increased health and welfare costs offset by efficiency gains as measured by gross ton miles gtm per employee and reduced headcounts  ii workforce reduction related costs of million  iii higher fuel prices  and iv flooding in the upper midwest and more severe winter weather conditions early in which increased expenses compared to compensation and benefits expenses of  million were million  or percent  higher than primarily due to wage rate increases and higher benefit rates 
in addition  scheduled wages were significantly higher in the first and second quarters as a result of more severe weather conditions requiring increased maintenance and additional crews 
these increases were partially offset by lower employment levels 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due to higher ramping expenses incurred as a result of new services added which improve efficiency and safety at the intermodal ramp facilities  decreased recoveries as compared with the prior year  increased legal expense primarily related to coal rate disputes  higher contract equipment maintenance costs due to more locomotives under maintenance contracts  increased haulage expense  and increased other expenses as a result of flooding in the upper midwest in the early part of the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than primarily due to a higher capital base 
equipment rents expenses for of million were million lower than reflecting reduced equipment levels  including cars  trailers  containers and automotive equipment 
fuel expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than primarily as a result of a cent increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel 
consumption in was  million gallons compared with  million gallons in however  gtm per gallon increased to from  or percent  compared with  attributable to newer locomotive fleet  fuel economy initiatives during the year  and commodity mix 
the cent increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel is net of a cent decrease in the average purchase price more than offset by a cent decrease in the hedge benefit per gallon as compared with a cent hedge benefit in materials and other expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than principally reflecting i workforce reduction costs of million incurred in the fourth quarter of for severance  pension  medical  benefit and other related costs for approximately positions see other matters employee merger and separation costs  ii increases in environmental and casualty expenses compared with  iii lower income from easements  and iv increased costs caused by flooding in the upper midwest and higher utilities as a result of higher rates and increased consumption due to more severe winter weather conditions early in additionally  during the company incurred million of charges due to employee related severance  medical and other benefit costs and the loss of previously earned state tax incentives 
interest expense of million for was million  or percent  higher than reflecting higher average debt levels  partially offset by lower interest rates 
other expense was million higher compared with primarily due to million in losses recognized related to non rail investments and fewer land sales in the non rail investments consisted of freightwise  inc  an internet transportation exchange  pathnet telecommunications  inc  a telecommunications venture  a portfolio of other non core real estate investments  and a decline in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies 
offsetting the above were million of expenses related to the termination of the proposed bnsf business combination with canadian national railway company cn 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income in was million  or per share  compared with  million  or per share  for the decrease in earnings per share is primarily due to the effect on net income of a million increase in fuel expenses and recognition in of a gain of million pretax in connection with prior period line sales  less costs of million pretax related to those sales  partially offset by the favorable effect of the common stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources common stock repurchase program 
revenues total revenues for were  million or million higher than revenues of  million 
the million increase primarily reflects increases in the consumer and industrial products sectors partially offset by lower coal and agricultural products revenues 
average revenue per car unit decreased in to  from  in volumes increased for the year but experienced a general slowing late in based on economic conditions which continued into during  based on reporting to the aar  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic market decreased point to percent 
consumer products revenues of  million improved million  or percent  compared with reflecting increases in the automotive  international  truckload  and perishable sectors  partially offset by decreases in the intermodal marketing companies imc and direct marketing sectors 
international revenues were up due to high levels of trans pacific trade as well as market share gains 
the growth in perishables was from the success of new service offerings and a partial recapture of the truck market 
automotive revenues increases were reflected by industry wide automobile production for most of the year and more profitable longer haul traffic despite essentially flat volumes year over year 
increases in truckload revenues were partially offset by decreases in the direct marketing sector due to decreased loadings within the ltl sector and in the imc sector due to pricing pressures and strong over the road competition 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  as a result of volume decreases due to a decrease in demand as a result of milder weather and high customer inventories that affected shipments for most of the year  while benefited from an inventory build up in preparation for possible year outages 
industrial products revenues of  million for were million higher than due to increases from the metals and minerals sectors  partially offset by decreased chemicals  forest products and machinery revenues 
the metals sector increases were a result of a strong market for steel and increases in minerals were due to higher demand for clay and sand used in domestic oil production 
these increases were partially offset by decreased shipments of industrial chemicals  softness in the forest products sector  and lower shipments of heavy machinery 
agricultural products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than primarily due to weaker corn export shipments to the pacific northwest and mexico  and decreased shipments of gulf and pacific northwest wheat  both caused by worldwide crop competition 
revenues were also lower as a result of decreased shipments of bulk foods due to an oversupply of sugar and supplier price competition in the syrup market which resulted in less traffic 
expenses total operating expenses for were  million  an increase of million  or percent  compared with operating expenses for of  million  despite a million increase in fuel expenses 
compensation and benefits expenses of  million were million  or percent  lower than primarily due to lower employment levels and reduced incentive expense partially offset by increased base wages 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  lower than primarily as a result of decreased joint facility and contract switching charges as well as recoveries related to prior periods 
this decrease was partially offset by increased contract equipment maintenance costs due to an increase in the number of locomotives under maintenance contracts and volume related increases in ramping expenses 
equipment rents expenses of million were million  or percent  lower than as a result of lower lease rates on rail cars as well as a decrease in the number of leased agricultural commodity and coal cars  partially offset by increased locomotive rental expense 
fuel expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than  as a result of a cent increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel  partially offset by a percent decrease in consumption from  million gallons to  million gallons 
the increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel includes a cent increase in the average purchase price  partially offset by the increase in hedge benefit of cents per gallon compared with additional expense from hedging of cent per gallon in materials and other expenses of million for were million  or percent  lower than principally reflecting i reorganization costs of million incurred in the second quarter of for severance  pension  medical and other benefit costs for approximately involuntarily terminated salaried employees see other matters employee merger and separation costs  ii lower current year environmental expenses and other materials costs compared with  and iii higher current year gains from easement sales 
offsetting these decreases were i million of employee related severance  medical and other benefit costs recorded in the second quarter of for approximately involuntarily terminated employees  primarily material handlers in mechanical shops and trainmen reserve boards  ii million credit for the reversal of certain liabilities associated with the consolidation of clerical functions in the second quarter see other matters employee merger and separation costs  iii the loss of previously earned state tax incentives in the second quarter  and iv higher costs in related to the maintenance of leased equipment 
interest expense for of million increased million  or percent  principally reflecting higher debt levels resulting from the company s share repurchase program and higher interest rates 
total debt increased to  million at december   from  million at december  other expense was million higher compared with primarily due to a million pretax deferred gain recognized during in connection with the sale of rail lines in southern california in and  and the recognition in of million pretax of expenses related to the termination of the proposed combination with cn 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations is bnsf s principal source of liquidity 
bnsf generally funds any additional liquidity requirements through debt issuance including commercial paper  through the leasing of assets  and through the sale of a portion of its accounts receivable 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million during compared with  million during the decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to a decrease in net income and deferred income taxes  and the receipt of a non recurring million special dividend from the company s equity investment in ttx company in the first quarter the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in cash from operations resulting from changes in working capital 
during  the company sold an additional million of its accounts receivable under the accounts receivable sales program a r sales program 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was  million during compared with  million during the decrease in cash used primarily reflects the temporary acquisition of equipment in that the company ultimately sold and leased back through operating leases in and expenditures relating to freightwise  inc these reductions are partially offset by an increase in cash capital expenditures 
a breakdown of cash capital expenditures during  and is set forth in the following table year ended december  in millions maintenance of way mechanical information services other total maintenance of business    new locomotives and freight cars expansion and other total    bnsf acquired all of the locomotives it committed to acquire in through operating leases 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities during was million primarily related to common stock repurchases of million  a net reduction in borrowings of million and dividend payments of million  partially offset by proceeds of million resulting from the exercise of million stock options 
in march  million of year remarketable bonds issued in were called by the holder of the call option 
bnsf subsequently purchased the option from the holder and retired the bonds and incurred an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  due to early retirement 
additionally  in march  bnsf issued a million  percent note due april in may  the company increased the amount of debt securities under its shelf registration  enabling it to issue debt securities in one or more series at an aggregate offering price not to exceed billion  and issued million of percent notes due july  the net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper 
subsequent to this debt issuance  the company had million of capacity under the may shelf registration statement 
in february  a put option on million of medium term notes paying a coupon of percent was exercised by the holders and the company repaid the holders primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 
in april  bnsf issued million of percent notes due april and million of percent debentures due april the net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper which increased primarily as a result of higher share repurchases 
at the time of issuing the million of percent notes and the million of percent debentures discussed above  the company closed out two treasury lock transactions  each in an amount of million  at gains of approximately million and million  respectively  which have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the lives of the notes and the debentures  respectively 
in april  bnsf railway issued million of privately placed debt collateralized by locomotives that were acquired in this debt carries an interest rate of percent and has annual maturities through in august  bnsf issued million of percent debentures due august the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper  which increased primarily as a result of higher share repurchases 
at the time of issuing these debentures  the company closed out a treasury lock transaction in the amount of million at a gain of approximately million  which has been deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the year life of the debentures 
in december  bnsf issued million of percent notes due december the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper  which increased primarily as a result of higher share repurchases 
at the time of issuing these notes  the company closed out a treasury lock transaction in the amount of million at a gain of approximately million  which has been deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the year life of the notes 
aggregate long term debt to mature in is million 
bnsf s ratio of total debt to total capital was percent at december   compared with percent at december   and percent at december  free cash flow bnsf generated free cash flow calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures  other investing activities and dividends paid of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
dividends common stock dividends declared were per share annually for  and dividends paid on common stock were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
on january   the board of directors the board declared a quarterly dividend of cents per share on outstanding shares of common stock  par value  payable april   to stockholders of record on march  common stock repurchase program in july  the board authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market 
in december  april and september  the board authorized extensions of the bnsf share repurchase program  adding million shares at each date to the total shares previously authorized bringing bnsf s share repurchase program to million shares 
during  and  the company repurchased approximately million  million  and million shares  respectively  of its common stock at average prices of per share  per share  and per share  respectively 
total repurchases through december   were million shares at a total average cost of per share  leaving million shares available for repurchase out of the million shares authorized 
long term debt and lease obligations the company s business is capital intensive 
bnsf has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operating activities which it uses to fund capital additions  service debt and pay dividends 
additionally  the company relies on access to the debt and leasing markets to finance a portion of capital additions on a long term basis 
free cash flow has also been used in recent years to repurchase common stock 
the company utilizes a commercial paper program backed by bank revolving credit agreements to manage liquidity needs 
the information below summarizes the more significant obligations of the company at december  for and the foreseeable future  the company expects that cash flow from operating activities  access to capital markets and bank revolving credit agreements will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its obligations when due 
the company believes these sources of funds will also be sufficient to fund capital additions that are necessary to maintain its competitiveness and position the company for future revenue growth 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was times for the year ended december  additionally  the company s ratio of net cash flow provided by operating activities divided by total average debt was percent for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s obligations under long term debt and lease obligations at december  payments due by period year total or less years years thereafter in millions long term debt a    capital lease obligations b operating leases b   total     a excluding capital lease obligations b gross payments due which include an interest component in addition to the obligations described above  the company acts as guarantor for certain debt and lease obligations of others 
bnsf does not expect to perform under these guarantees in the foreseeable future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into long term contractual requirements for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business 
such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material adverse affect on the company s liquidity 
credit agreements bnsf issues commercial paper from time to time which is supported by revolving credit agreements 
at december  and  there were no bank borrowings against the revolving credit agreements 
outstanding commercial paper balances are considered as reducing the amount of borrowings available under these agreements 
the bank revolving credit agreements allow borrowings of up to billion 
borrowing rates are based upon i libor plus a spread determined by bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings  ii money market rates offered at the option of the lenders  or iii an alternate base rate 
the company generally classifies commercial paper as long term to the extent of its borrowing capacity under these facilities 
the commitments of the lenders under the short term agreement allow borrowings of up to billion and are scheduled to expire in june the company has the ability to have any amounts then outstanding mature as late as june the remaining million of commitments of the lenders under the long term agreement are scheduled to expire in june annual facility fees for the short term and long term facilities are currently percent and percent  respectively  and are subject to change based upon changes in bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings 
the maturity value of commercial paper outstanding at december   was million  reducing the total capacity available under the revolving credit agreements to  million 
bnsf must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under its revolving credit agreements 
the revolving credit agreements include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility  including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test  a maximum debt capital test  and a million cross default provision 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
bnsf s tangible net worth is billion greater than the minimum consolidated tangible net worth required under the agreement  and the maximum debt capital test provides approximately billion of debt capacity above bnsf s outstanding debt as of december   before an event of default would occur under these covenants 
with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency  any event of default has either or both  a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements 
a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event 
sale of accounts receivable bnsf s a r sales program  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  includes a provision that allows the institutions participating in this program  at their option  to cancel the program if bnsf railway s senior unsecured credit rating falls below investment grade 
upon cancellation  bnsf would not be able to sell additional receivables under this program 
if such event were to occur  bnsf would expect to have sufficient liquidity remaining under its revolving credit agreements to fund the full amount of securities outstanding under the sales program 
the receivable facility expires in and the company intends to renew this facility under similar terms 
the company is not aware of any pending significant adverse changes to its credit rating that would cause it or bnsf railway to fall below investment grade 
other matters casualty and environmental personal injury claims  including work related injuries to employees  are a significant expense for the railroad industry 
employees of bnsf are compensated for work related injuries according to the provisions of the federal employers liability act fela 
fela s system of requiring the finding of fault  coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system  contributed to significant increases in expense in past years 
bnsf has implemented a number of safety programs to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense 
bnsf made payments for personal injuries of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to both asserted and unasserted personal injury claims 
the company s operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
bnsf s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
additionally  many of bnsf s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  as well as similar state laws generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
bnsf has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp for study and cleanup costs at approximately superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined the superfund sites and  in many instances  is one of several prps 
in addition  bnsf may be considered a prp under certain other laws 
accordingly  under cercla and other federal and state statutes  bnsf may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site 
if there are other prps  bnsf generally participates in the cleanup of these sites through cost sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site 
costs are typically allocated based on relative volumetric contribution of material  the amount of time the site was owned or operated  and or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each prp 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites as well as costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated 
liabilities for environmental cleanup costs are initially recorded when bnsf s liability for environmental cleanup is both probable and a reasonable estimate of associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
bnsf conducts an ongoing environmental contingency analysis  which considers a combination of factors including independent consulting reports  site visits  legal reviews  analysis of the likelihood of participation in and the ability of other prps to pay for cleanup  and historical trend analyses 
bnsf is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts at approximately sites  including the superfund sites  at which it is participating in the study or cleanup  or both  of alleged environmental contamination 
bnsf paid approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively  for mandatory and unasserted cleanup efforts  including amounts expended under federal and state voluntary cleanup programs 
bnsf has recorded liabilities for remediation and restoration of all known sites of million at december   compared with million at december  bnsf anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at december   will be paid over the next five years 
no individual site is considered to be material 
liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent bnsf s best estimates for remediation and restoration of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims 
unasserted claims are not considered to be a material component of the liability 
although recorded liabilities include bnsf s best estimates of all costs  without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties  bnsf s total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required  evolving environmental laws and regulations  advances in environmental technology  the extent of other parties participation in cleanup efforts  developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated  and developments in environmental surveys and studies of potentially contaminated sites 
as a result  future charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year as individual site studies and remediation and restoration efforts proceed or as new sites arise 
however  management believes it is unlikely any identified matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on bnsf s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
other claims and litigation bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters and personal injury claims 
while the final outcome of these items cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available  it is the opinion of management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of bnsf  although  an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year

substantially all of the planned reductions were made by september  hedging activities on january   bnsf adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and recorded a cumulative transition benefit of million  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the standard requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for documentation and measurement of hedging activities 
the company currently uses derivatives to hedge against increases in diesel fuel prices and interest rates as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
the company formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instrument 
this documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet  commitments or forecasted transactions 
the company assesses at the time a derivative contract is entered into  and at least quarterly  whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas no 
 is recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in aoci as a separate component of stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
bnsf monitors its hedging positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
fuel fuel costs represented percent of total operating expenses during and due to the significance of diesel fuel expenses to the operations of bnsf and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the company maintains a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
the intent of the program is to protect the company s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering into fuel hedge instruments based on management s evaluation of current and expected diesel fuel price trends 
however  to the extent the company hedges portions of its fuel purchases  it may not realize the impact of decreases in fuel prices 
conversely  to the extent the company does not hedge portions of its fuel purchases  it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices 
based on annualized fuel consumption during and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would result in approximately million of additional fuel expense on an annual basis 
the fuel hedging program includes the use of derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as of december   bnsf had entered into fuel swap agreements utilizing gulf coast heating oil to hedge the equivalent of approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average price of approximately cents per gallon 
additionally  as of december   bnsf had entered into costless collar agreements effective through for the equivalent of approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average call price of approximately cents per gallon and an average put price of approximately cents per gallon 
the above prices do not include taxes  transportation costs  certain other fuel handling costs  and any differences which may occur from time to time between the prices of commodities hedged and the purchase price of bnsf s diesel fuel 
at december   bnsf s fuel hedging program covered an average of percent of estimated fuel purchases for hedge positions are closely monitored to ensure that they will not exceed actual fuel requirements in any period 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 the company recorded a cumulative transition benefit of million  net of tax  to aoci related to deferred gains on transactions as of january  subsequent changes in fair value for the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the purchase of the related hedged item is recognized in earnings  at which time changes in fair value previously recorded in oci are reclassified to earnings and recognized in fuel expense 
during  the company recognized a loss of approximately thousand related to the ineffective portion of derivatives in fuel expense 
at december   aoci includes a pretax loss of million  all of which relates to derivative transactions that will expire throughout settled fuel hedging contracts are a million payable and a million receivable at december  and  respectively  and are recorded in working capital 
bnsf measures the fair value of fuel swaps from daily forward price data provided by various external counterparties 
to value a fuel swap  the company uses a month average of forward gulf coast heating oil prices for the period hedged 
the fair value of fuel costless collars is calculated and provided by the corresponding counterparty 
between december  and january   the company entered into additional fuel hedge transactions to hedge the equivalent of approximately million gallons of diesel fuel in at an average price of cents per gallon 
at january   bnsf s fuel hedging program covered approximately percent of estimated fuel purchases for in addition  between december  and january   the company entered into fuel swap agreements utilizing west texas intermediate wti crude oil to hedge the equivalent of approximately million and million gallons of diesel fuel for and  respectively  at an average price of per barrel 
interest rate from time to time  the company enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and establishing rates in anticipation of future debt issuances as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
the company uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
the cumulative transition benefit of adopting sfas no 
as of january   included million  net of tax  related to deferred gains on closed out derivatives which were used to lock the treasury rate on anticipated borrowings 
the deferred gains for cash flow hedges in aoci are being amortized to interest expense over the amount remaining in aoci 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swaps to fix the libor component of commercial paper 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
and qualify for the short cut method of recognition 
as of december   bnsf had entered into five separate interest rate swaps to fix the libor component of million of commercial paper at an average rate of percent 
the average floating rate bnsf received on the swaps  which fluctuates monthly  was percent as of december  these swaps will expire in and as of december   aoci included a pretax loss of million related to the fair value of these interest rate swaps 
fair value hedges the company also enters into interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
these swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 
these fair value hedges qualify for the short cut method of recognition and  therefore  no portion of these swaps is treated as ineffective 
as of december   bnsf had entered into five separate swaps on a notional amount of million in which it pays an average floating rate  which fluctuates quarterly  based on libor 
the average floating rate to be paid by bnsf as of december   was percent and the average fixed rate bnsf is to receive is percent 
these swaps expire in  and as of december   bnsf recorded an asset of million in other current assets for the fair value of these swaps 
bnsf s measurement of the fair value of interest rate swaps is based on estimates of the mid market values for the transactions provided by the counterparties to these agreements 
labor approximately percent of bnsf railway s employees are union represented 
bnsf railway s union employees work under collective bargaining agreements with different labor organizations 
the negotiating process for new  major collective bargaining agreements covering all of bnsf railway s union employees has been underway since the bargaining round was initiated november  wages  health and welfare benefits  work rules  and other issues have traditionally been addressed through industry wide negotiations 
these negotiations have generally taken place over a number of months and have previously not resulted in any extended work stoppages 
the existing agreements have remained in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act s procedures which include mediation  cooling off periods  and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted 
the current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached 
the national carriers conference committee nccc  bnsf s multi employer collective bargaining representative  reached a final agreement with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes bmwe resolving wage  work rule and benefit issues through which was implemented in july bmwe represents bnsf s track  bridge and building maintenance employees  about one fourth of bnsf s unionized workforce 
in june  the nccc reached a tentative agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew  which represents approximately five percent of bnsf s unionized workforce  addressing wage and work rule issues through  but leaving health and welfare benefit issues for settlement in separate talks with other railroad unions 
ibew members failed to ratify the tentative agreement 
no new talks with ibew are scheduled 
during the third quarter of  the nccc reached a tentative agreement with the united transportation union utu covering wage and work rule issues through the year for conductors  brakemen  yardmen  yardmasters and firemen  approximately one third of bnsf s unionized workforce 
this agreement is also subject to ratification by the utu s membership 
as in the tentative ibew agreement  health and welfare benefit issues were not resolved with utu and remain the subject of continuing negotiations 
railroad industry personnel are covered by the railroad retirement system instead of social security 
bnsf railway s contributions under the railroad retirement system have been approximately triple those in industries covered by social security 
the railroad retirement system  funded primarily by payroll taxes on covered employers and employees  includes a benefit roughly equivalent to social security tier i  an additional benefit similar to that allowed in some private defined benefit plans tier ii  and other benefits 
investment of tier ii railroad retirement assets has until recently been limited to special interest bearing u 
s 
treasury securities 
the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act act of creates a new national railroad retirement investment trust to hold tier ii railroad retirement assets and empowers the trustees to invest these assets in the same types of investments available to private sector retirement plans 
in addition to liberalizing certain retirement benefit requirements for rail employees  the act reduces tier ii railroad retirement tax rates on rail employers beginning in and eliminates a supplemental annuity tax 
the company expects to realize savings of approximately million in and million in future adjustments in the tier ii railroad retirement tax rates assessed on both rail employers and rail employees will depend on railroad retirement fund levels and annual savings could be as much as million by inflation due to the capital intensive nature of bnsf s business  the full effect of inflation is not reflected in operating expenses because depreciation is based on historical cost 
an assumption that all operating assets were depreciated at current price levels would result in substantially greater expense than historically reported amounts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  bnsf utilizes various financial instruments which inherently have some degree of market risk 
the qualitative and quantitative information presented in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and notes and of the consolidated financial statements describe significant aspects of bnsf s financial instrument programs  which have a material market risk 
interest rate sensitivity from time to time  bnsf enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for purposes of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and establishing rates in anticipation of future debt issuances as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt to manage its ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
bnsf s measurement of fair value of interest rate swaps is based on estimates of the mid market values for the transactions provided by the counterparties to these agreements 
as discussed in note in the consolidated financial statements  the company uses several types of interest rate swaps to minimize exposure to risk 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges under sfas no 
all swap transactions outstanding with an interest rate component are reflected in the table below 
december  maturity date there fair after total value cash flow hedges variable to fixed libor swaps in millions average fixed rate average floating rate fair value hedges fixed to variable swaps in millions average fixed rate average floating rate the tables below provide information about bnsf s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and for debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  the fair values presented in the table below do not include the fair value of the swaps 
december  maturity date there fair after total value fixed rate debt in millions    average interest rate variable rate debt in millions average interest rate december  maturity date there fair after total value fixed rate debt in millions    average interest rate variable rate debt in millions average interest rate bnsf has included million in maturities and million in maturities of commercial paper and bank borrowings in the and tables  respectively 
in addition  maturities in included in the and tables exclude million of percent notes due  which may be redeemed in at the option of the holder 
maturities in included in the table exclude million of percent notes due called by the holder of the call option in march of bnsf subsequently purchased the option from the holder and retired the bonds 
the fair value of bnsf s long term debt is primarily based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues  or on the current rates that would be offered to bnsf for debt of the same remaining maturities 
the carrying amount of commercial paper and bank debt approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
commodity price sensitivity bnsf has a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
swap transactions are typically based on the price of pipeline delivery of gulf coast heating oil 
bnsf either pays or receives the difference between the hedge price and the actual average price of gulf coast heating oil during a specified determination period for a specified number of gallons 
swap transactions are generally settled with the counterparty in cash 
based on historical information  bnsf believes there is a significant correlation between the market prices of diesel fuel and gulf coast heating oil 
bnsf measures the fair value of gulf coast heating oil swaps from daily forward price data provided by various external counterparties 
to value a swap  the company uses a month average of forward gulf coast heating oil prices for the period hedged 
the fair value of fuel costless collars is calculated and provided by the corresponding counterparty 
the tables below provide information about bnsf s diesel fuel hedging instruments that are sensitive to changes in diesel fuel prices 
the tables present notional amounts in gallons and the weighted average contract prices by contractual maturity date 
the prices included in the tables below do not include taxes  transportation costs  certain other fuel handling costs and any differences which may occur from time to time between the prices of commodities hedged and the purchase price of bnsf s diesel fuel
