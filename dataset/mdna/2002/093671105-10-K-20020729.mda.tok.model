item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information called for by this item is contained in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april   under the heading management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  and is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally in the operations of its subsidiaries and the reporting of its consolidated financial results  the company is affected by changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company and its subsidiaries are exposed  and which may be material  relate to interest rates on cash equivalents  available for sale securities  residual interests in securitizations  mortgage servicing rights msrs  mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments  investments in mortgage loans held for sale  debt and margin lending activities  retail trading volumes  commercial paper issuances and foreign exchange rates  generating translation gains and losses the company and its subsidiaries have market risk sensitive instruments entered into for non trading and trading purposes 
the company s broker dealer holds marketable fixed income securities for resale to retail clients 
non trading interest rates 
the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed centrally by the office of the chief financial officer of the company 
the finance committee of the company s board of directors approves the company s policies and procedures utilized to manage the company s interest rate risk 
the company has established investment guidelines to help minimize the market risk exposure of its non residual available for sale securities portfolio 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity  preservation of principal  and earnings  which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates 
nearly of the company s cash equivalents ce and available for sale securities  which includes residual interests  afs are classified as short term  compared to last year 
the ce assets are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality  short term investments  including qualified money market funds taxable and tax exempt 
as of april   the portfolio had a duration of less than years 
table of contents with an average credit quality of aaa 
with such a short maturity  the portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the company s residual interests in securitizations  the majority of afs  and msrs are subject to prepayment risk  because a mortgage borrower has the option to prepay a mortgage loan at any time 
prepayment risk tends to increase when interest rates fall due to the benefits of refinancing 
the expected income from these residual interests and msrs is sensitive to movements in interest rates due to this sensitivity to mortgage prepayments 
the prepayment risk is partially offset with the collection of prepayment penalties  a feature on the majority of originated loans 
residual interests are recorded based on discounted cash flow models utilizing prepayment  interest rate  credit losses and discount rate assumptions 
prepayment and loss assumptions are based on evaluation of the actual experience of the company s servicing portfolio or on market rates on new portfolios  taking into consideration the current and expected interest rate environment and its expected impact on future prepayment and default rates 
at april   the sensitivity of the current fair value of the residual interests to a adverse change in prepayment rates would lower the fair value of the residuals by million 
mortgage servicing rights are recorded based on the present value of estimated future cash flows related to servicing loans utilizing market discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds 
the prepayment speeds are estimated using the company s historical experience and third party market sources for fixed rate mortgages with similar coupons and prepayment reports for comparable adjustable rate mortgage loans 
at april   the sensitivity of the current fair value of msrs to a adverse change in prepayment rates would lower the fair value by million 
residual assets bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus the floating rate funding cost  and the on going basis risk between the indices of the floating rate assets and liabilities  offset somewhat by interest rate caps sometimes embedded within the securitization 
an adverse change in interest rates of would impact the fair value of residuals by million 
see residual interests in securitizations and mortgage servicing rights in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  for further sensitivity analysis of the other assumptions and detailed explanations of the cash flow models used 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments 
these commitments to fund mortgage loans consist of fixed and variable rate loans that will be sold in the secondary market 
the company has commitments to fund mortgage loans of billion at april   as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the contracts 
external market forces impact the probability of commitments being exercised  and therefore  total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the risk with these commitments to fund mortgage loans is that interest rates might rise between the time the customer locks in the interest rate on the loan and the time the loan is sold 
in some instances  the company will utilize forward contracts on fnma mortgage backed securities to reduce the interest rate risk related to its fixed rate origination commitments 
it is the company s policy to utilize these financial instruments only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss in earnings associated with a defined or quantified exposure 
they are purchased from certain broker dealer counterparties 
if the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to default risk 
as the risk of default depends on 
table of contents the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the company s policy requires that such transactions may be entered into only with counterparties that are rated a or better or an equivalent rating by recognized rating agencies 
as a matter of practice  the company has limited the counterparties to major banks and financial institutions meeting such standards 
all interest rate contracts conform to the standard international swaps and derivatives association  inc documentation 
commercial paper is issued throughout the year primarily to fund receivables associated with the business services segment  mortgage loans held for sale  participation in rals and seasonal working capital needs 
at april  and april   no commercial paper was outstanding 
for fiscal year  the average issuance term was days and average outstandings were million 
this compares with days and million for fiscal year as commercial paper borrowings are seasonal  interest rate risk typically increases through february and declines to zero by fiscal year end 
see financial condition under the heading management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  at april   there were no hedges outstanding related to long term debt 
the company s long term debt at april  consists primarily of fixed rate senior notes  therefore  a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings 
see long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  the company s broker dealer holds interest bearing receivables from customers  brokers  dealers and clearing organizations which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature 
the company s broker dealer funds these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers  brokers and dealers  including stock loan activity 
although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and liabilities  the company believes it is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area 
as a result  any change in interest rates would not materially impact the company s consolidated pretax earnings 
foreign exchange rates 
the operation of the company s subsidiaries in international markets provides exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the currencies involved are the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the british pound 
international tax operations constituted approximately of the company s fiscal year consolidated pretax earnings  compared to in fiscal as currency exchange rates change  translation of the financial results of international tax operations into us dollars does not presently materially affect  and has not historically materially affected  the consolidated financial results of the company  although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results of the international businesses 
the company translates revenues and expenses related to its international operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period 
the sensitivity analysis of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates compares the us dollar variance in using the actual exchange rates and using rates that have been adversely adjusted by 
the company estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact reported pretax earnings from continuing operations by approximately  such impact represents approximately of the pretax earnings of international tax operations for fiscal year and approximately 
of the company s pretax earnings for such year 
in fiscal  a change in exchange rates would have impacted fiscal pretax earnings by approximately  or of international tax operations pretax earnings and 
of the company s pretax earnings 

table of contents trading the company s trading portfolio is effected by changes in market rates prices 
the risk is the loss of earnings arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio 
the company s broker dealer holds the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and such portfolio represents 
of the company s total assets 
the market value of the company s trading portfolio at april  was approximately million 
the impact of a change in the market value of these investments would be approximately million  or about 
of consolidated pretax earnings 
with respect to its fixed income securities portfolio  the company manages its market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk  maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions
