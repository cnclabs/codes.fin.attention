on march   the company completed a settlement with cpsc and cowboy  which provided the company with the remaining interest in the us mexico pipelines  matamoros terminal facility and related land  permits or easements the acquired assets previously constructed and or owned by cpsc and leased to the company 
until the settlement was completed see below  the company had recorded the remaining portion of the us mexico pipelines and matamoros terminal facility as a capital lease 
in addition  as part of the settlement  the company conveyed to cpsc all of its rights to a certain property the sold asset 
the foregoing is more fully discussed below 
the terms of the settlement did not deviate in any material respect from the terms previously reported except that the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the settlement see below was reduced from  to  as a result of a decrease in the market value of the company s common stock 
in connection with the settlement  the company agreed to pay cpsc million the purchase price for the acquired assets  less agreed upon credits and offsets in favor of the company totaling million 
the remaining million was paid at the closing of the settlement by a cash payment of  to cpsc and the issuance to or for the benefit of cpsc of two promissory notes in the amounts of million the cpsc note payable in monthly installments of approximately  including interest at per annum and  the other note payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  including interest at per annum 
the other note is collateralized by a first priority security interest in the us portion of the pipelines comprising the acquired assets

in addition  the security interest granted under the cpsc note is shared on a pari passu basis with certain other creditors of the company see notes h and k to the consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the cpsc note  the company is entitled to certain offsets related to future costs which may be incurred by the company in connection with the acquired assets 
in addition to the payments described above  the company agreed to assume certain liabilities which were previously owed by cpsc in connection with construction of the acquired assets

cpsc s obligations under the debt are to be paid by the company to the extent that there are amounts owed by the company under the cpsc note  through direct offsets by the company against the cpsc note 
after the cpsc note is fully paid  the company will no longer have any payment obligation to cpsc in connection with the debt and therefore  cpsc will then be fully responsible to the company for any remaining obligations in connection with the debt the remaining obligations 
cpsc s obligations to the company in respect of the remaining obligations are collateralized by a deed of trust lien granted by cpsc in favor of the company against the sold asset 
cpsc also granted the company a pipeline related easement on the sold asset 
the principal of million plus accrued and unpaid interest is included in long term debt and the corresponding amount required to be paid by cpsc has been recorded as a mortgage receivable see note h to the consolidated financial statements

acquisition of mexican subsidiaries 
effective april   the company completed the purchase of of the outstanding common stock of both termatsal and pennmex the mexican subsidiaries  previous affiliates of the company which were principally owned by an officer and director 
the company paid a nominal purchase price 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has included the results of the mexican subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements at july  and since inception the operations of the mexican subsidiaries have been funded by the company and such amounts funded were included in the company s consolidated financial statements prior to the acquisition date 
therefore there were no material differences between the amounts previously reported by the company and the amounts that would have been reported by the company had the mexican subsidiaries been consolidated since inception 
mexican operations 
under current mexican law  foreign ownership of mexican entities involved in the distribution of lpg or the operation of lpg terminal facilities is prohibited 
foreign ownership is permitted in the transportation and storage of lpg 
mexican law also provides that a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage or distribution 
pennmex has a transportation permit and the mexican subsidiaries own  lease  or are in the process of obtaining the land or rights of way used in the construction of the mexican portion of the us mexico pipelines  and own the mexican portion of the assets comprising the us mexico pipelines  the matamoros terminal facility and the saltillo terminal 
the company s mexican affiliate  tergas  sa de sa tergas  has been granted the permit to operate the matamoros terminal facility and the company relies on tergas permit to continue its delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility 
tergas is owned by jorge bracamontes  an officer and director of the company  and the remaining balance is owned by another officer and a consultant of the company 
the company pays tergas its actual cost for distribution services at the matamoros terminal facility plus a small profit 
the company had previously completed construction of an additional lpg terminal facility in saltillo  mexico the saltillo terminal 
the company was unable to receive all the necessary approvals to operate the facility at that location 
the company has identified an alternate site in hipolito  mexico  a town located in the proximity of saltillo to relocate the saltillo terminal 
the cost of such relocation is expected to be between  and once completed  the company expects the newly constructed terminal facility to be capable of off loading lpg from railcars to trucks 
the newly constructed terminal facility will have three truck loading racks and storage to accommodate approximately  gallons of lpg 
once operational  the company can directly transport lpg via railcar from the brownsville terminal facility to the saltillo area 
the company believes that by having the capability to deliver lpg to the saltillo area  the company will be able to further penetrate the mexican market for the sale of lpg 
through its operations in mexico and the operations of the mexican subsidiaries and tergas  the company is subject to the tax laws of mexico which  among other things  require that the company comply with transfer pricing rules  the payment of income  asset and ad valorem taxes  and possibly taxes on distributions in excess of earnings 
in addition  distributions to foreign corporations  including dividends and interest payments may be subject to mexican withholding taxes 
deregulation of the lpg industry in mexico 
the mexican petroleum industry is governed by the ley reglarmentaria del art culo constitutional en el ramo del petr leo the regulatory law to article of the constitution of mexico concerning petroleum affairs the regulatory law  and ley org nica del petr leos mexicanos y organismos subsidiarios the organic law of petr leos mexicanos and subsidiary entities the organic law 
under mexican law and related regulations  pemex is entrusted with the central planning and the strategic management of mexico s petroleum industry  including importation  sales and transportation of lpg 
in carrying out this role  pemex controls pricing and distribution of various petrochemical products  including lpg 
beginning in  as part of a national privatization program  the regulatory law was amended to permit private entities to transport  store and distribute natural gas with the approval of the ministry of energy 
as part of this national privatization program  the mexican government is expected to deregulate the lpg market deregulation 
in june  the regulatory law for lpg was changed to permit foreign entities to participate without limitation in the defined lpg activities related to transportation and storage 
however  foreign entities are prohibited from participating in the distribution of lpg in mexico 
upon deregulation  mexican entities will be able to import lpg into mexico 
under mexican law  a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage and distribution 
the company or its affiliates expect to sell lpg directly to independent mexican distributors as well as pmi upon deregulation 
the company anticipates that the independent mexican distributors will be required to obtain authorization from the mexican government for the importation of lpg upon deregulation prior to entering into contracts with the company 
during july  the mexican government announced that it would begin to accept applications from mexican companies for permits to allow for the importation of lpg pursuant to provisions already provided for under existing mexican law 
in connection with the above  in august  tergas received a one year permit from the mexican government to import lpg 
during september  the mexican government asked tergas to defer use of the permit and as a result  the company did not sell lpg to distributors other than pmi 
in march  the mexican government again announced its intention to issue permits for free importation of lpg into mexico by distributors and others beginning august  which was again delayed until february tergas permit to import lpg expired during august tergas intends to obtain a new permit when the mexican government begins to accept applications once more 
as a result of the foregoing  it is uncertain as to when  if ever  deregulation will actually occur and the effect  if any  it will have on the company 
however  should deregulation occur  it is the company s intention to sell lpg directly to distributors in mexico as well as pmi 
tergas also received authorization from mexican customs authorities regarding the use of the us mexico pipelines for the importation of lpg 
the point of sale for lpg which flows through the us mexico pipelines for delivery to the matamoros terminal facility is the united states mexico border 
for lpg delivered into mexico  pmi is the importer of record
