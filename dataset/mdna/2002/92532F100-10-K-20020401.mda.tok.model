item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a global biotechnology company 
we seek to discover  develop  and commercialize major pharmaceutical products independently and with collaborators 
chemogenomics  our proprietary  systematic  genomics based platform  is designed to accelerate the discovery of new drugs and to expand intellectual property coverage of drug candidate compounds and classes of related compounds 
we believe this approach  which targets gene families  has formed the basis for successful drug discovery and for the advancement of drug candidates by vertex and its collaborators 
we are developing several drug candidates in commercial collaborations in which we retain rights to downstream product revenue 
we have four research facilities worldwide with over  employees 
our facilities are located in cambridge  ma  madison  wi  san diego  ca and abingdon  uk 
our first approved product is agenerase amprenavir  an hiv protease inhibitor  which we co promote with glaxosmithkline 
we earn a royalty from glaxosmithkline on sales of agenerase 
agenerase has received approval in countries worldwide  including the united states  the member states of the european union eu  and japan  where the drug is sold under the trade name prozei 
we have more than twelve drug candidates in development to treat viral diseases  cancer  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and neurological disorders 
on july   we completed a merger with aurora biosciences corporation aurora 
the merger unites aurora s industry leading cell biology capabilities with vertex s integrated drug discovery expertise creating a comprehensive  scalable platform for systematically accelerating drug candidate output in target rich gene families 
aurora specializes in assay development  screening and cell biology capabilities 
aurora generates revenue primarily from product sales and services related to assay development and specialized screening services and systems 
we acquired all of aurora s outstanding common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction  for approximately million shares of vertex common stock  aurora s outstanding options were converted into options to purchase million shares of vertex common stock 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on march   aurora completed a merger with panvera corporation panvera 
panvera is a biotechnology company engaged in the development  manufacture and supply of proteins for evaluation of targets and drug screening assays for high throughput screening 
aurora acquired all of panvera s outstanding common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all references to aurora refer to the combined company of aurora and panvera 
aurora will continue to operate as an independent commercial business  although vertex has incorporated certain of aurora s existing and emerging drug discovery technologies into its own gene family based drug discovery platform 
all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of aurora as though the merger had been in effect on the dates indicated 
we have significant collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies including aventis  eli lilly  glaxosmithkline  novartis  and serono 
with the addition of aurora  we have other collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies for assay development  screening services and the development of specialized screening platforms 
these collaborations and contracts provide us with financial support and other valuable resources for our research programs  development of our clinical drug candidates  and marketing and sales of our products 
we believe that we are positioned to commercialize multiple products in the coming years  which we expect will generate increased milestone payments  product revenues and royalty payments 
we consider our collaborations with novartis and aventis material to our business 
novartis has agreed to pay us up to approximately million in pre commercial payments  comprised of million paid upon the signing of the agreement in may  up to million in product research funding over six years and up to approximately million in further license fees  milestone payments and cost reimbursements 
these amounts are based on the development of eight drug candidates 
in addition  novartis created a million loan facility to support certain clinical studies  which we may draw down in increments of up to million for each drug candidate 
to date we have not drawn down against the loan facility 
the loan is interest free and novartis will forgive the full amount of any advances if novartis accepts the drug candidate for development under our agreement 
we will receive royalties on any products marketed as a part of the collaboration and under certain conditions will have co promotion rights in the us and europe 
we retain the rights to any intellectual property resulting from the collaboration 
aventis has paid us million for prior research costs associated with pralnacasan vx and has agreed to pay us million in milestone payments for successful development by aventis of pralnacasan in rheumatoid arthritis  the first targeted indication  as well as similar milestone payments for each additional indication 
we have granted aventis an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and market pralnacasan as well as an exclusive option for other compounds discovered as part of the research collaboration between vertex and aventis that ended in aurora has contracts in place that require the delivery of products  licenses and services throughout these contracts account for over million of potential revenue of which approximately million relates to one specific contract 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we plan to make significant investments in research and development for our other potential products 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is a policy that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial conditions and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we consider our revenue recognition policy critical and therefore we have separately outlined this policy below 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we generate revenue through collaborative research and development agreements  product sales  assay development and screening services and royalty agreements 
our collaborative and other research and development revenue is primarily generated through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners for the development of small molecule drugs that address major unmet medical needs 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable up front license fees  funding of research and development efforts  payments based upon achievement of certain at risk and substantive milestones and royalties on product sales 
under the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactively to january   we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
research funding is recognized as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
milestones that are based on designated achievement points and that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative contract  are recognized as earned  when the corresponding payment is considered reasonably assured 
we evaluate whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome and the level of investment required 
product sales include instrumentation system sales  technology licensing and biotechnology product sales as well as commercial drug substance sales 
revenue from licenses where we have continuing obligations is recognized over the period of the license 
revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized when the license is issued  provided that there are no significant continuing obligations and the payment is non refundable and non creditable 
revenue from sales of commercial drug substance  biotechnology products and certain instrumentation system sales  is recognized upon shipment  when the title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
sales under long term production contracts are recognized using percentage of completion accounting  based on actual costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs to complete 
funding for prototype instrumentation systems was recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements  which approximated costs incurred 
milestones related to delivery of the components of the prototype systems were recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement of acceptance from the customer 
service revenues include assay development  screening services and contracted product development 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the service period if we believe such method will approximate the expense being incurred 
revenue from upfront fees is deferred and recognized over the service period 
aurora has certain contracts under which it agrees to sell instrumentation systems and technology licenses in addition to providing assay development and screening services 
each of these separable elements may be individually delivered and is not considered essential to the functionality of the others 
we allocate revenue under such contracts to each of the separable elements based on the relative fair value of each element  which under most of our agreements approximates the stated price in the contract 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories  as provided by our collaborative partner  and is generally recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not been historically significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
results of operations in the third quarter of  in connection with our overall review of accounting policies concurrent with our merger with aurora  we elected to change our revenue recognition policy for collaborative and other research and development revenues from the emerging issues task force no 
eitf method to the substantive milestone method 
we believe this method is preferable because it is reflective of the company s on going business operations and is more consistent with the industry practices following the prior year implementation of sab throughout the biotechnology industry 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition for collaborative and other research and development revenues to the eitf method in conjunction with our adoption of sab under the eitf method  adopted retroactively to january   we recognized revenue from research and development arrangements  including non refundable upfront license fees  milestones and research and development funding  over the period of our continuing involvement using the lesser of the non refundable cash received or the result achieved using percentage of completion accounting 
where we had no continuing involvement  non refundable license fees were recorded as revenue upon receipt and milestones were recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone by the collaborative partner 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to revenue recognition recorded in the third quarter of  retroactive to january   resulted in a non cash charge to income of  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of  retroactive to january   resulted in a non cash charge to income of  the january  charge to income resulted in revenue of  being recognized in that was recognized in prior periods 
additionally     and  will be recognized as revenue in   and thereafter  respectively  which was included in the january charge to income 
the following discussions relating to net loss  net loss per basic and diluted common share and revenue for the years ended december  and reflect the pro forma results as if we had followed the substantive milestone method of revenue recognition from our inception 
actual results for reflect the adoption of the substantive milestone method as of january  year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share including merger related expenses of  compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share in total revenues increased to  in compared to  in in  revenue was comprised of  in royalty revenue   in product sales revenue   in service revenue and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue  as compared with  in royalty revenue   in product sales revenue   in service revenue and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue in royalties consist primarily of agenerase royalty revenue 
agenerase royalty revenue is based on estimated and actual worldwide net sales of agenerase 
product sales include instrumentation sales  technology licensing and biotechnology product sales as well as sales of commercial drug substance 
product sales increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in product sales in from is due to increased technology licensing revenue and increased biotechnology product revenue  partially offset by a decrease in instrumentation revenue 
instrumentation revenue decreased in from due to the completion and delivery of several significant products and services in late and early  that have not been replaced  due in part to aurora s strategic shift in focus toward technology licensing and discovery service activity 
the increase in biotechnology revenue is attributed to a continued increase in demand for protein drug targets  drug screening assays and other biotechnology products 
service revenue includes assay development  screening services and contracted product development 
service revenue increased to  in from  in the increase in service revenue is attributable to new strategic alliances and screening collaborations entered into in late and early collaborative and other research and development revenue consists of research support payments  development reimbursements  milestones and amortization of previously received up front or license payments 
collaborative and other research and development revenue increased in by or  as compared with due primarily to collaborative agreements signed in may and december of in we recognized  of revenue under the novartis collaboration compared with  in in an agreement signed in may  we agreed with novartis to collaborate to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs targeted at the kinase protein family 
effort related to the kinase research program increased significantly in in december we entered into a collaboration with serono to discover  develop and market caspase inhibitors 
in connection with the serono agreement we recognized  in revenue during compared with  during in may we received and recognized as revenue a  license payment from aventis under a collaborative agreement covering the development of pralnacasan vx  an orally active inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme ice 
aventis has exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and market pralnacasan as well as an exclusive option for other compounds discovered as part of the collaboration that ended in the balance of collaborative and other research and development revenue for and is made up of research support payments  development reimbursements and milestones from other collaborative partners 
royalty costs of  and  in and  respectively  consist primarily of royalty payments on the sales of agenerase 
product costs decreased  or to  in from  in the decrease in product costs is attributable to a strategic shift in focus of the aurora business towards technology licensing and discovery services activity 
instrumentation revenue  which has lower gross margins  decreased during the year  while technology license and biotechnology product revenue  which has higher gross margins  increased during the year 
cost of service revenue increased from  in to  in  primarily due to a related increase in service revenue 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in primarily due to the continued expansion of our research and development operations  an increase in the number of drug development candidates from eight candidates at december  to more than twelve candidates at december  and the continued shift of aurora s strategy towards drug discovery activity 
during there was a significant increase in research and discovery activities associated with our gene family programs  specifically our kinase research program being conducted under our novartis collaboration  and our protease research program 
development expenses increased as we continued to advance our drug candidates with substantial investment in our p map kinase specifically vx and our impdh programs 
also  related to our expansion were increases in personnel  facilities expenses and equipment depreciation 
we have more than drug candidates in development targeting a range of major diseases 
our collaborative partners have agreed to fund portions of our research and development programs and or to conduct certain research and development related to specified drug candidates 
collaborator and company sponsored research and development expenses for and were as follows research development total research development total in thousands collaborator sponsored       company sponsored       total       to date we have incurred in excess of  in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
as of december  we had full time employees dedicated to research and development across our four research facilities 
we anticipate research and development expenses will continue to increase as we add personnel and expand research and development activities to accommodate our existing collaborations and additional commitments we may undertake in the future 
we estimate that it takes to years industry average is years to discover  develop and bring to market a pharmaceutical product 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda as outlined below estimated phase objective duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years pre clinical toxicology to identify risks for humans  gather early to years pharmacokentic data phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  to years metabolizes and interacts with other drugs phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the to years drug fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under mths to years certain prescribed labelling the successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and the cost related to discovery  pre clinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase ii and phase iii clinical trials

merger related costs of  consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees associated with the acquisition of aurora completed on july  interest income increased approximately  to  in from  in the increase is due to a higher level of cash and marketable securities for the full year of compared with the increase in cash and marketable securities is primarily a result of the proceeds received from the issuance in september of  of convertible subordinated notes due september september notes 
in march we issued  of convertible subordinated notes march notes  which we called for redemption in september and which were subsequently converted to equity 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from  in the increase is due to interest expense associated with the september notes 
using the equity method of accounting we recorded  as our share of loss in altus biologics inc altus  for the year ended december   compared with  as our share of loss for the year ended december  the loss is included in other  net on the statement of operations 
effective september   coincident with a financial restructuring of altus  we changed our method of accounting for altus from the equity method to the cost method 
please see note h to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
effective july   we adopted derivative implementation group issue no 
a  contracts that provide for net share settlement dig a 
pursuant to the adoption of dig a we recorded a  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the value of warrants held in altus 
this amount is included in investments in the december  balance sheet 
as of september   the warrants no longer qualified as derivatives under dig a due to changes in the terms of the warrants coincident with a financial restructuring of altus 
in october  we re purchased  in principal amount of our september notes for cash consideration of  as a result of this transaction we recorded an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt of  net of  of deferred debt costs in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share in total revenues increased to  in from  in in revenue was comprised of  in royalty revenue   in product sales   in service revenues  and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue  compared with  in royalty revenue   in product sales   in service revenues and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue in product sales increased  or  from  in to  in the increase in product sales is due primarily to increases in licensing revenue and biotechnology product revenue 
the increase in licensing revenue is attributable to several significant license agreements executed in mid to late the increase in biotechnology product revenue can be attributed to increased demand for protein drug targets and drug screening assays 
service revenue increased significantly during the year  from  in to  in the increase in service revenue is attributable to several significant service agreements entered into in late and early in we recognized  in collaborative and other research and development revenue 
approximately  of our collaborative and other research and development revenue earned in was earned under the novartis collaboration 
additionally we received and recognized as revenue a  license payment from aventis under our collaborative agreement and a  substantive milestone payment for the approval of agenerase in the eu the balance of our collaborative and other research and development revenue in was earned under other collaborations consisting of research support payments  development reimbursements and amortization of previously received up front or license payments 
comparatively  in we recognized  in collaborative and other research and development revenue 
this included a  initial license payment and a  substantive milestone payment in connection with the signing of the aventis agreement as well as a  substantive milestone payment for the us fda approval of agenerase 
the balance of collaborative and other research and development revenue recognized during was earned under other collaborations 
product costs increased  or to  in from  in the increase in product costs resulted from increased purchases of materials and technology development expenses associated with instrumentation revenue and increased expenses associated with biotechnology product revenue 
instrumentation expenses increased at a rate significantly greater than the corresponding revenue due to unanticipated additional resources required to complete certain projects 
cost of service revenue increased from  in to  in this was consistent with the increase in service revenue for the same period 
royalty costs of  and  in and  respectively  primarily consisted of royalty payments on the sales of agenerase 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in research and development expenses was principally due to the continued expansion of our research and development operations and an increase in the number of drug development candidates over the prior year 
related to our expansion were increases in personnel  facilities expenses  equipment depreciation and increased technology license payments for access to gene database information 
the expenses associated with the expansion were partially offset by a decrease in external development activities associated with certain development candidates 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased  during the year  from  in to  in the increase was primarily a result of increased personnel and professional expenses associated with our growth 
additionally  during marketing expenses associated with agenerase increased 
interest income increased from  in to  in the increase is due to a higher level of cash and marketable securities throughout primarily as a result of the proceeds received from the issuance of  in principal amount of the march notes and the september notes 
partially offsetting the increase in interest income was a  net write down of a marketable security due to management s assessment that the decline in value was other than temporary 
interest expense increased significantly from  in to  in the increase is due to interest expense associated with the march notes and the september notes 
in the third quarter of we recognized debt conversion expense of  representing the make whole payment resulting from our call for redemption on september  of our march notes 
as a result of the call for redemption  the holders of the notes were entitled to a make whole payment of per  principal amount of the notes  which was paid in cash on october  using the equity method of accounting we recorded  as our share of loss in altus in  compared with  as our share of loss in the loss is included in other  net on the statement of operations 
please see note h to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have been funded principally through strategic collaborative agreements  strategic technology alliances  revenues from assay development and screening services  product sales  royalties  public offerings and private placements of our equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  and investment income 
with the approval and launch of agenerase in april  we began receiving product royalty revenues 
in  we completed private placements of the march notes and the september notes 
we have continued to increase and advance products in our research and development pipeline 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis as we continue to develop existing and future compounds and to conduct clinical trials of potential drugs 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization expenditures in the future and additional expenses related to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to finance these substantial cash needs with future payments under our existing and future collaborative agreements  strategic technology alliances  royalties from the sales of agenerase  revenues from assay development and screening services  product sales  royalties  existing cash and marketable securities of  at december   together with investment income earned thereon  and facilities and equipment financing 
to the extent that funds from these sources are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of securities or other methods of financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our aggregate cash and marketable securities decreased  to  including cash and cash equivalents of  at december  from  including cash and cash equivalents of  at december  net cash used in operations was  for the year ended december   which resulted from the net loss of  offset by  of net non cash charges and gains  an increase in deferred revenue of  and  of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
deferred revenue increased due to cash received for research funding and receipt of a milestone payment  the majority of which was not recognized as revenue in net cash used in investing activities for was  which included property and equipment expenditures of  and net purchases of marketable securities of  cash used in financing activities during was  including approximately  for the retirement of  of principal on our september notes as well as  used for the repayment of capital lease and loan obligations 
the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and benefit plans for the year ended december  provided commitments at december   our future minimum commitments included facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases  as well as contractual commitments related to our research and development programs 
in january we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space presently under construction 
we will begin paying rent in march the lease will expire in with the option to extend the lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each ultimately expiring in our commitments under this lease  as well as additional non cancelable operating leases and contractual  research and development program commitments  are included in the table below in thousands operating leases r d contractual year commitments commitments thereafter  total minimum commitments   forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements about our business  including our expectation that i we are positioned to commercialize multiple products in the coming years that we expect will generate increased revenues ii our losses will continue  iii our research and development expenses  our administrative and commercialization expenses and our expenses related to filing  prosecuting and defending our patents and intellectual property rights will increase  and sales  general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with current levels  and iv the chiron corporation and oregon health sciences university litigation will not have a material adverse effect on us 
while management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward looking statements  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other things  our inability to successfully integrate aurora into our existing business  our inability to further identify  develop and achieve commercial success for new products and technologies  the possibility of delays in the research and development necessary to select drug development candidates and delays in clinical trials  the risk that clinical trials may not result in marketable products  the risk that we may be unable to successfully finance and secure regulatory approval of and market our drug candidates  our dependence upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaborations  the levels and timing of payments under our collaborative agreements  uncertainties about our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations and acquire new technologies on satisfactory terms  if at all  the development of competing systems  our ability to protect our proprietary technologies  patent infringement claims  risks of new  changing and competitive technologies and regulations in the us and internationally

legal proceedings chiron corporation chiron filed suit on july  against vertex and eli lilly and company in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement by the defendants of three us patents issued to chiron 
the infringement action relates to research activities by vertex and eli lilly in the hepatitis c viral protease field and the alleged use of inventions claimed by chiron in connection with that research 
chiron has requested damages in an unspecified amount  as well as an order permanently enjoining the defendants from unlicensed use of the claimed chiron inventions 
during  chiron requested and was granted a reexamination by the us patent and trademark office of all three of the patents involved in the suit 
chiron also requested and  over the opposition of vertex and eli lilly  was granted a stay in the infringement lawsuit  pending the outcome of the patent reexamination 
that reexamination proceeding is still on going and the stay is still in effect 
however  a notice of intent to issue a reexamination certificate has been issued in two of the three chiron patents in suit 
while the length of the stay and the final outcome of the lawsuit cannot be determined  we maintain that chiron s claims are without merit and intend to defend the lawsuit  if and when it resumes  vigorously 
on december  oregon health sciences university filed suit against vertex in the district court of oregon 
the complaint in the suit seeks to name bruce gold  an employee of oregon health sciences university  as an inventor and oregon health sciences university as part of owner  of five of vertex s neurophilin patents 
the suit stems from assays run on vertex compounds by dr 
gold under a sponsored research agreement in we have investigated the inventorship on these patents and have concluded that bruce gold is not an inventor  oregon health sciences university has no ownership interest in any of these patents  and that the claims made in this complaint are without merit 
we intend to contest this claim vigorously

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its investment portfolio  vertex owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve vertex s capital until it is required to fund operations  including vertex s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
vertex does not have derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
interest rate risk vertex invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of its interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of vertex s investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of its investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  vertex does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
