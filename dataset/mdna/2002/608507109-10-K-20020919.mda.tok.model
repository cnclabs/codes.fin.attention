business overview our primary business is the development  sale and support of software applications for the design and manufacture of injection molded plastic parts 
we develop software products internally and through cooperative research relationships with a number of public and private educational and research organizations around the world 
we categorize our products into two groups 
our design optimization products allow a product designer or engineer to simulate the manufacture of a plastic part to determine the optimal part design and part mold combination 
our design optimization solutions include our moldflow plastics insight mpi series for in depth mold design and our moldflow plastics advisers mpa series for part design and high level mold design 
our manufacturing solutions products allow plant engineers and managers to maintain and optimize manufacturing conditions throughout the manufacturing process 
our manufacturing solutions include three products 
our moldflow plastics xpert mpx series for production set up and production monitoring was introduced in fiscal in fiscal  two additional products were launched under the moldflow brand  shotscope and ez track 
shotscope  the sole product of branden technologies  a company we acquired in march  is a shop floor product that monitors  analyzes and assists in the scheduling of injection molding production processes 
ez track provides real time  plant wide production monitoring and reporting 
we sell our products and services internationally through our direct sales operations in countries 
we also sell through a network of distributors and value added resellers and through distribution arrangements with developers of other design software products 
on april   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of advanced cae technology  inc  which formerly conducted business as c mold 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of branden technologies  inc branden 
these business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of c mold and branden from the dates of their respective acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  intangible assets  hedging arrangements and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding fully our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition  valuation allowances  acquisition accounting  impairment of intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets  and hedge accounting 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the licensing of computer software products and from services consisting of maintenance and support  consulting  material testing and training 
we follow aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  both of which provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses upon product shipment provided that evidence of the purchase commitment exists  the license fee is fixed or determinable  management deems that collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
our software products do not require significant modification or customization and installation of the products is generally routine and requires insignificant effort 
we recognize revenue from maintenance and support contracts ratably over the related contract period and from training and other services as they are performed 
maintenance and support contracts are often entered into at the same time as the sale of software licenses 
in accordance with sop  we consider these multiple elements of a single arrangement 
payment for this arrangement is typically received up front  and the total fee is then allocated ratably to these elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for each  which is determined based upon the prices charged to customers when these elements are sold separately  the revenue allocated to each is then recognized as described above for these elements 
when vsoe does not exist for all of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but does exist for the undelivered elements  we employ the residual method of accounting for revenue recognition  as defined by sop the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
vsoe for the undelivered elements is determined based on the prices charged to customers when these elements are sold separately  typically from the renewal of the annual maintenance and support contracts 
we also provide consulting services  training of customers employees  and material testing services 
when bundled with other elements in a single arrangement  revenue is allocated to these services as described above 
revenue allocated to these activities is then recognized as the services are performed 
valuation allowances management must estimate the amount of our accounts receivable which may be uncollectible due to the inability of our customers to make payments 
we review the composition of accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on a specific identification basis 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates after entering into a revenue arrangement resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments beyond that estimated by management  additional allowances may be required 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  management writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as of june   our inventory balance was  after write downs for obsolete  missing and excess stock of  during fiscal management records a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based upon our historical results of operations  it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management believes that the net deferred tax asset represents the best estimate  based upon the weight of available evidence  of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
if such evidence were to change  based upon near term operating results and longer term projections  the amount of the valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax asset may be decreased or increased 
as of june   the balance of our deferred tax assets was  net of a valuation allowance of significant judgments and estimates are involved in assessing each of these valuation allowances 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
acquisition accounting on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of c mold and on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of branden 
these business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of c mold and branden from the dates of their respective acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in both acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items were based upon management s estimates and  in certain cases  an independent professional valuation 
certain of the acquired assets were intangible in nature  including developed technologies  assembled workforces  acquired customer base and non compete agreements 
management employed a number of valuation methodologies in determining the fair value of these intangible assets 
the fair value of the acquired developed technologies was based upon a discounted cash flow model 
assembled workforces later reclassified to goodwill and the acquired customer base were valued using estimated replacement costs 
values assigned to non compete agreements were based upon the salaries of the individuals subject to such agreements 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
impairment of intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets management assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred 
our assessment of intangible assets  other long lived assets and  prior to july   goodwill is based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles 
potential impairment of goodwill after july  is evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
for the purposes of the impairment tests  management considers the company itself a single reporting unit  as defined by sfas no 
to conduct these tests  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we must then compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying value to determine if an impairment has occurred 
this exercise entails the allocation of the reporting units total fair value to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to that of the purchase price allocation methodology prescribed under sfas no 
any resulting impairment would be expensed immediately 
to estimate its fair value  we first employ a market value approach 
under this approach  the average closing price of the company s common stock  as reported by the nasdaq national market  is determined for a set number of days in its third fiscal quarter 
a control premium is added to this average price based upon an estimation by independent valuation professionals engaged to compile and examine a five year history of merger and acquisition history of similar sized business in our industry 
this adjusted value is deemed to be the fair value of the company s stock under the market value approach and is multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to determine the company s total fair value 
this is then compared to the recorded carrying value of the company s total net assets on that same day to identify potential impairment 
while we believe that the market value approach provides a reasonable estimate of fair value  there are macroeconomic factors that could significantly affect the results of this methodology 
if we believe that these factors have resulted in an inaccurate estimation of fair value  other valuation models will be employed including the income approach or the cost approach 
the blended results from these three methodologies would then be used to estimate the total fair value of the company 
these assessments and the related analyses involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
in may  we settled several claims outstanding against an escrow account established in our acquisition of c mold 
this settlement resulted in our receipt of  of cash and recognition of  net  of non recurring gains 
included in this net amount  among other things  was the write off of  of intangible assets related to certain non compete agreements which we considered impaired after the settlement 
as of june   our remaining goodwill and intangible assets were million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
hedge accounting we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales and a portion of our foreign currency denominated intercompany research and development payments with derivative financial instruments  including currency options  zero cost collars and other instruments 
as the hedging activities are based upon forecasts  a significant amount of judgment and estimation is required in assessing the appropriateness of hedge accounting for the instruments 
if these judgments or estimates are incorrect  or if the hedging transactions are not highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items  amounts currently recorded as unrealized gains and losses may be realized in our earnings 
at june   hedging instruments with fair values of  and  were recorded as components of other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively 
net unrealized losses on these instruments of  were included as a component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we generate revenue from two principal sources license fees for our packaged software products  and services revenue derived from maintenance and support services related to our software products  consulting  training and material testing 
software licenses revenue 
typically  our customers pay an up front  one time fee for a perpetual license of our software products 
the amount of the fee depends upon the number and type of software modules purchased and the number of the customers employees or other users who can access the software product simultaneously 
our mpa product is subject to the terms of a click wrapped software license agreement that is included as part of each customer s installation process 
revenue for our impa product is earned on a pay per use basis and  to date  has not been significant 
for sales of our mpi  mpx  shotscope and ez track products  we generally require a signed license agreement 
in addition  we receive royalty payments from developers of other software products related to the bundling of our software with their design software programs 
services revenue 
we also derive revenue from maintenance and support contracts  which require us to provide technical support services to customers and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
we also provide consulting services  training of customers employees and material testing services 
we recognize our software licenses revenue and our services revenue as described in critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition 
cost of software licenses revenue 
cost of software licenses revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with compact discs and related packaging material  duplication and shipping costs  hardware components for our manufacturing solutions products and the salaries of our distribution personnel 
in some cases  we pay royalties to third parties for usage based licenses of their products that are embedded in our software programs 
product royalties are expensed when the related obligation arises  which is generally upon the license of our products  and are included in cost of software licenses revenue 
also included in cost of software licenses revenue in fiscal is amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of salary  fringe benefit and facility related costs of our maintenance and support  consulting and training activities and of our material testing laboratories  and is expensed when incurred 
additionally  from time to time  we engage outside consultants to meet peaks in customer demand for consulting services 
research and development 
we employ a development staff to enhance our existing products and to develop new ones 
product development expenditures  which include salaries  benefits  travel and facilities costs  are generally charged to operations as incurred 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  requires the capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility up to the point of the product s release 
software development costs eligible for capitalization prior to the first quarter of fiscal were not significant 
we established technological feasibility of mpi in the first quarter of fiscal and released the product commercially in november in accordance with sfas no 
 research and development costs of  were capitalized related to mpi these development costs are being amortized to cost of software licenses revenue over the estimated economic life of the product 
selling and marketing 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions to our sales staff  employee benefits costs  sales office facilities  travel and promotional events such as trade shows  advertising  print and web based collateral materials  and public relations programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include compensation  routine legal  audit and other costs of our executive management  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative support activities 
litigation 
our litigation expenses consisted of legal costs incurred to pursue our claims against c mold regarding theft of our trade secrets and to defend against related counterclaims 
upon the closing of our acquisition of c mold in april  all related claims were dismissed 
as a result  we have not incurred and anticipate that we will not incur any further significant litigation costs related to this matter 
nonrecurring charges 
in fiscal  we incurred nonrecurring charges related to actions we took to restructure our business 
included in these charges were costs incurred to terminate leases on certain facilities in the united states and europe  severance costs related to the involuntary termination of employees and professional fees arising from legal  accounting and tax services 
in fiscal  we incurred nonrecurring charges to terminate a lease on a facility and to immediately expense costs of purchased in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of c mold 
amortization of goodwill 
these costs represent the amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards  among other things  eliminate the amortization of goodwill 
as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal amortization of other intangible assets 
these costs represent the amortization of other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
these assets include developed technology  customer base  protective covenants and  in fiscal and  assembled workforce 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net includes our cost of borrowings  including interest cost incurred on our working capital lines of credit and stockholder loans  net of interest income earned on invested cash balances 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated asset and liability balances  recognized gains and losses on our foreign currency hedging instruments  and other non operating income and expense items 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes includes federal  state and foreign taxes on our income in the countries in which we do business 
our income taxes during prior periods  in particular fiscal and  have been significantly reduced by the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
our fiscal year end is june references to  or mean the fiscal year ended june  unless otherwise indicated 
during the fiscal year  we follow a schedule in which each interim quarterly period ends on the saturday of the thirteenth full week of the reporting period 
the following table sets forth statement of income data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue fiscal year ended june  revenue software licenses services total revenue costs and expenses cost of software licenses revenue cost of services revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation nonrecurring charges amortization of goodwill amortization of other intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal years  and revenue the following table sets forth our total revenue by geographic region for each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended june  in thousands except percentage data revenue asia australia    americas    europe    total    percentage of total revenue asia australia americas europe total software licenses revenue 
in fiscal  software licenses revenue decreased by million  or  from million to million 
the following table sets forth our software licenses revenue by product group for each of  and fiscal year ended june  in thousands except percentage data software licenses revenue design optimization solutions    manufacturing solutions   total    percentage of total software licenses revenue design optimization solutions manufacturing solutions total the decrease in software licenses revenue in fiscal was a result of the continued economic slowdown experienced in the markets we address  particularly with respect to our design optimization solutions 
demand for our products is largely driven by the demand for the end products of our customers 
the industries in which many of our key customers operate  including the consumer products  telecommunications and electronics industries have been among those most severely impacted by the prolonged economic pressures experienced globally throughout fiscal as such  these companies have typically reduced their spending on capital items including spending on our products 
the overall decline in software licenses revenues was partially offset by increased sales of our manufacturing solutions products 
software licenses revenues from our manufacturing solutions products increased million  or  in fiscal  from million to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the impact of our acquisition of branden in march during fiscal  regional sales of software licenses have fluctuated with no clearly discernible pattern 
we experienced a lengthening of customer sales cycles in most geographic regions during the year and we saw notable weakness in our americas region in our fourth fiscal quarter  where many of our customers expressed intention to delay purchases until signs of an economic recovery became more apparent 
further  throughout the year  we experienced difficulty in predicting the timing of when customers would purchase our software products 
we expect that our software licenses revenue could continue to be subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter in the coming year as many of the industries we serve have not yet experienced a sustained economic recovery 
the following table sets forth our software licenses revenue by geographic region for each quarter of fiscal three months ended year ended september  december  march  june  june  in thousands asia australia      americas    europe      total      in fiscal  software licenses revenue increased by million  or  from million to million 
the main factors contributing to this growth included our april acquisition of c mold  the introduction of new products and new modules for existing product lines and the increase in our direct sales coverage  whereby we added new sales offices in all regions and increased the number of sales representatives from as of june  to at june  we added approximately new customers in fiscal  compared to approximately new customers in fiscal sales to new customers represented of total software license revenues in fiscal  compared to of total software license revenues in fiscal we sold seats of design optimization products and seats of manufacturing solutions products in fiscal  compared to  seats of design optimization products and seats of manufacturing solutions products in fiscal due to our acquisitions  comparison of these items to fiscal is not meaningful 
pricing of individual products within these product families can vary greatly  and the mix of products sold during a given period can significantly impact our average selling price per seat 
as such  we do not believe that an average selling price per seat provides a meaningful measure of our business 
services revenue 
services revenue has a lower gross profit margin than licenses revenue and accounted for approximately of our total revenue in and and in revenue from services increased by from the prior year in  from million to million  and by in  from million to million 
these increases were primarily in the sale of maintenance contracts  which was the result of historical growth in our customer base arising from software license sales 
costs and expenses cost of software licenses revenue 
our cost of software licenses revenue was million in  million in and  in the increases are due to the increased sales of our manufacturing solutions products  which have a higher cost of materials than our design solutions products  and an increase in personnel related costs 
in addition  fiscal includes amortization expense of  arising from capitalized software development costs 
cost of services revenue 
our cost of services revenue was million in and and million in the increase from to was mainly due to increased headcount in technical support and material testing activities 
there were no significant changes from to research and development 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease from to was attributable to the capitalization of  of development costs pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and  to a lesser extent  the elimination of technical positions in april as a part of the restructuring 
the increase from to was attributable to increased personnel costs and travel expenses  primarily related to the addition of research and development personnel as a result of our acquisition of c mold in april to a lesser extent  the increase in also was due to personnel added from our march acquisition of branden 
selling and marketing 
our selling and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in was due to reduced sales commission expense in light of the decline in revenue and  to a lesser extent  the elimination of positions in april as a part of the restructuring 
the increase in was principally due to headcount additions and an increase in promotional activities to support new releases of our software products  including telemarketing and international advertising programs 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in these increases were a result of escalating professional service fees  including the cost of our audit  tax planning and compliance and other accounting services 
in addition  we hired additional corporate staff in and incurred costs related to becoming a public company including a full year of expense related to director s and officers insurance premiums 
the expense for these premiums increased  in fiscal  or from in fiscal  these increases were partially offset by the elimination of administrative positions in april as part of the restructuring 
litigation 
litigation expenses were  in and consisted of legal costs to pursue our claims against c mold regarding theft of our trade secrets and to defend against counterclaims 
the litigation was suspended during the third quarter of fiscal and  upon the closing of our acquisition of c mold  all related claims were dismissed 
nonrecurring charges 
in fiscal  we incurred a million nonrecurring charge related to a corporate restructuring plan 
this plan was enacted to resize the company and reduce overhead in light of the economic climate 
the restructuring included the involuntary termination of employees in several countries and the closure or reduction of certain leased offices 
the severance portion of the charge was  and affected staff across all functions 
the largest component of the charge   was related to a reduction in the utilization of our leased space in the united kingdom 
other components of the charge included  of lease termination costs for facilities in the united states and france   of lease termination costs for equipment and automobiles and  of professional fees for tax and legal consultation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we incurred nonrecurring charges of  in connection with our acquisition of c mold  to immediately expense purchased in process research and development and for lease termination costs 
in the opinion of management  the purchased in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
consequently  our nonrecurring charges included  to write off such in process research and development costs during the fourth quarter of amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was zero in  million in and  in amortization expense in included a full year of amortization of goodwill acquired in the c mold purchase and one quarter of amortization of goodwill acquired in the branden purchase 
goodwill amortization ceased upon our adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets was  in   in and  in on july   we reclassified the carrying value of our acquired assembled workforce to goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
the amortization expense for fiscal reflects the net impact of eliminating the amortization of this assembled workforce and adding a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the branden purchase 
amortization expense in included a full year of amortization of other intangible assets acquired in the c mold purchase and one quarter of amortization of other intangible assets acquired in the branden purchase 
other income and expenses interest income expense  net 
our interest income was million in  million in and  in our interest is earned on investment of our cash balances which include the unused portion of the proceeds of our public offerings of common stock in march and december in  we earned lower income on our investments due to the declining interest rate environment  as reinvestments of maturities were at lower rates than in other income loss  net 
other income loss  net includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated asset and liability balances  recognized gains and losses on our foreign currency hedging instruments  and other non operating income and expense items 
during  we realized a net gain of  on the sale of land and other property in australia  a net gain of  gain on the sale of our remaining minority investment in an indian software company and other income of  arising from our settlement of several claims against an escrow account established at the time of our acquisition of c mold 
during  we realized a gain of million on the sale of a portion of our minority investment in a software company in connection with that company s initial public offering in india 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for the higher effective tax rate in was due to the impact of declining revenues and earnings in relation to certain fixed tax expenses 
the effective tax rates in and were lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through sales of our capital stock  stockholder loans  funds generated from operations and borrowings from lending institutions 
in march  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  raising million  net of offering costs 
in december  we completed a second offering of common stock  raising million  net of offering costs 
as of june   our primary sources of liquidity consisted of our total cash and cash equivalents balance of million  our marketable securities balance of million and our credit facilities described below 
in fiscal  we restructured our primary working capital credit facility  resulting in an available credit facility of million with a domestic bank 
the available borrowing base of the facility is subject to a calculation which is based upon eligible accounts receivable 
advances may be in the form of loans  letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts or other cash management lines 
the facility includes certain restrictive covenants  all of which we were in compliance with at june  these covenants include certain liquidity and profitability measures and restrictions that limit the ability of moldflow to merge  acquire or sell assets without prior approval from the bank 
at june   we had employed million of available borrowings through outstanding foreign exchange contracts and letters of credit 
the remaining available borrowings were million 
in addition to our primary working capital line of credit  we also utilize domestic and foreign banking institutions to provide liquidity to our subsidiaries 
we also have relationships with other banking institutions in order to facilitate foreign currency and hedging transactions 
as of june   we had no outstanding debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at june   our marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds with maturities in excess of three months but less than one year 
at june   marketable securities also included shares of a publically traded indian software company 
these shares represented a minority interest in the company and were sold in december for cash proceeds of  investments in marketable securities are made in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
the primary objective of this policy is the preservation of capital 
investments are limited to high quality corporate debt  government securities  municipal debt securities  money market funds and similar instruments 
the policy establishes maturity limits  liquidity requirements and concentration limits

cash was provided by our sale of land and certain other property in australia and our sale of our investment in the indian software company 
also  marketable securities matured or were otherwise converted into cash equivalents increasing our balance of cash and cash equivalents by million 
in  in addition to the purchase of fixed assets  million  net of cash acquired  was used to purchase branden and million was invested in marketable securities  net of proceeds from maturities and sales of similar instruments 
also in  million of proceeds were received on the sale of certain facilities 
in  cash was used for purchases of property and equipment  primarily for computers  networking and materials laboratory test equipment to support our global product development activities  and to enable worldwide data communications 
in  in addition to the purchase of fixed assets  million  net of cash acquired  was used to purchase c mold and million was invested in marketable securities 
also in  million was provided by the sale of a portion of our minority investment in the indian software company 
net cash of  was used in financing activities in net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in in  we used  to reacquire  shares of our outstanding common stock 
this was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises  purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and repayment of notes receivable from stockholders

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months following the date of this annual report 
on a long term basis or to complete acquisitions in the short term  we may require additional external financing through credit facilities  sales of additional equity or other financing vehicles 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements

impact of inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years 
risk factors and important factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties prior to making an investment in our common stock 
the following risks and uncertainties may also cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or predicted by our forward looking statements 
the existing general economic slowdown  particularly in our end markets  may continue to impact our results 
the demand for our products is largely driven by the demand for the products in our primary end markets 
many of these end markets  particularly the automotive  telecommunications  and electronics industries have experienced severe economic declines over the past twelve months which significantly and adversely affected our business in fiscal a continuation of this general economic slowdown will materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our revenue as compared to prior years  as was the case in fiscal  or by lowering our revenue growth rates when compared to those experienced prior to fiscal in addition  terrorist attacks on the united states and other increased hostilities around the world are continuing to cause widespread uncertainty and speculation in the united states and world financial markets 
this uncertainty and speculation may result in further economic contraction and a further suspension in the normal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and  as a result  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
for instance  our total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million as compared with total revenue of million in the immediately preceding quarter 
further  we have historically experienced lower  a slight decline  or no growth in revenue in our first fiscal quarter as compared with the preceding quarter as a result of seasonal factors  which decrease demand for our products in this quarter 
we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our future quarterly results of operations due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including seasonal slowdowns  in particular  in our first fiscal quarter  in many of the markets in which we sell our products  changes in the mix of products and services we provide as sales of our manufacturing solutions products and our services will result in lower gross margins and a longer selling cycle  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  including costs relating to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure  introductions of new services or enhancements by us and our competitors and changes in our and our competitors pricing policies  currency fluctuations  and timing and integration of acquisitions 
in addition  like many software companies  we usually record a larger percentage of our quarterly revenue in the third month of the fiscal quarter 
also  our manufacturing solutions products may involve a longer selling cycle with corresponding larger order sizes which may lead to an inability to close on orders or make shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of the fiscal quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results are often difficult to predict prior to the final days of the quarter 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may lose revenue 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  intense competition  technically complex products  frequent new product introductions  and evolving offerings by product manufacturers 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer on a timely basis products that meet customer demands 
for example  the introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
our growth and profitability also will depend upon our ability to expand the use and market penetration of our existing product lines as well as new products we introduce 
market acceptance of our products will depend in part on our ability to demonstrate the cost effectiveness  ease of use and technological advantages of our products over competing products 
future acquisitions and strategic relationships may result in lost revenue caused by business disruptions and missed opportunities caused by the distraction of our management 
integrating the businesses of c mold and branden technologies required time and focus by our management team 
we may engage in other acquisitions and strategic relationships in the future 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and  if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire another company  we will only receive the anticipated benefits if we successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner 
we may have to devote a significant amount of time and management and financial resources to do so 
even with this investment of management and financial resources  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that failed to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of acquired identifiable intangible assets that could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  we could incur significant expenses and we could be prevented from offering specific products or services 
our products include proprietary intellectual property 
we may become subject to claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
in the united states and elsewhere  a significant number of software and business method patents have been issued over the past decade and the holders of these patents have been actively seeking out potential infringers 
in addition  our manufacturing solutions products require interaction with an injection molding machine  the use and technology of which are subject to a wide variety of world wide patents and other intellectual property protection 
if any element of our products or services violates third party proprietary rights  we might not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue offering our products or services without substantial re engineering and any effort to undertake such re engineering might not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
any judgment against us could require us to pay substantial damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services 
we may lose sales to competitors if we are unable to protect important intellectual property 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our technology 
we may be unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
we face the following risks in protecting our intellectual property we cannot be certain that our pending united states and foreign patent applications will result in issued patents or that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology  third parties may design around our patented technologies or seek to challenge or invalidate our patented technologies  the contractual provisions that we rely on  in part  to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets and proprietary information may be disclosed to the public  our trade secrets may also become known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors  and foreign countries  including some of those in which we do business  may reduce or limit the protection of our intellectual property rights 
our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks 
the majority of our employees  including sales  support and research and development personnel  are located outside of the united states 
similarly  the majority of our revenues are derived from customers outside the united states and certain intellectual property is owned by subsidiary companies located outside the united states 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to numerous risks  including decreased liquidity resulting from longer accounts receivable collection cycles typical of foreign countries  decreased revenue on foreign sales resulting from possible foreign currency exchange and conversion issues  lower productivity resulting from difficulties managing our sales  support and research and development operations across many countries  decreased earnings based on changes in tax regulations in foreign jurisdictions  lost revenue resulting from difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  lost revenue resulting from the imposition by foreign governments of trade protection measures  and higher cost of sales resulting from import or export licensing requirements 
we have more limited financial and other resources than many of our competitors and potential competitors and may be unable to compete successfully against them 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to successfully compete 
companies in our industry and entities in similar industries could decide to focus on the development of software solutions for the design  analysis and manufacturing of injection molded plastic parts 
many of these entities have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
disruption of operations at our development facilities could interfere with our product development and production cycles 
a significant portion of our computer equipment  source code and personnel  including critical resources dedicated to research and development  are presently located at operating facilities in australia  the united states and the united kingdom 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in our operations and services 
extensive or multiple interruptions in our operations at our development facilities could severely disrupt our product development 
our manufacturing solutions products may lead to product liability claims against us 
our manufacturing solutions products are installed directly on our customers injection molding machines and  in certain cases  automatically adjust the operation of these machines 
as a result  it is possible that our customers may claim that our product interfered with the proper operation of their machines and may seek reimbursement for consequential and other damages from us 
although we expressly disclaim any liability for consequential or other damages in connection with our sale of these products  this disclaimer may not protect us from claims for damages from our customers and these claims may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or our reputation generally 
in addition  our insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us against any product liability claims that arise 
this insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
our stock price is highly volatile and our stock price could experience substantial declines and our management s attention may be diverted from more productive tasks 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  the per share price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility in the past twelve months 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  including revenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  changes in our senior management personnel  distribution or sale of shares of moldflow stock by insiders or affiliated persons  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  a decrease in the demand for our common stock  investor perception of our industry or our prospects  and general technology or economic trends 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
we may be involved in securities class action litigation in the future 
such litigation often results in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop our products in research centers in australia  the united kingdom and the united states 
we sell our products globally through our direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  political climate and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in the future  we expect to increase our international operations in our existing markets and in geographic locations where we do not have any operations now 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
we engage in hedging transactions designed to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we cannot assure you  however  that any efforts we make to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate changes will be successful 
for a more detailed description of our hedging activities  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates hedge accounting 
we invest our excess cash balances in highly liquid  interest bearing instruments 
these instruments expose us to interest rate risk and  as a result  changes in interest rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
these instruments  along with our accounts receivable  also potentially expose us to credit risk 
our investments are limited to high grade corporate debt securities  government issued debt  municipal debt securities  money market funds  and similar high quality instruments to mitigate this credit risk 
the credit risk associated with accounts receivable is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over geographic regions and industries
