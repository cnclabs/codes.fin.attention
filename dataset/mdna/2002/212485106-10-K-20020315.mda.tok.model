critical accounting policies revenue recognition for certain img contracts  the company recognizes professional and consulting and or software license revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the terms of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of the costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
goodwill at december   the company had goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions with a net carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles are evaluated periodically if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying value

market risk the company derived approximately of its consolidated revenues from outside of north america 
the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on its operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  the company exposes itself to some counterparty credit risk 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which it enters into such agreements 
the company currently uses cash flow hedges 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts expiring within one year as hedges of anticipated cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from its variable rate borrowings 
at december   the company had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and had sold in accounts receivable on a variable rate basis 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the interest rate for of variable rate borrowings 
the swap agreement exposes the company to credit risk in the event the counterparty could not perform under the agreement 
the company managed this risk by entering into the interest rate swap agreements with a highly rated financial institution 
based upon the company s exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percent point change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately fluctuations in quarterly results the company has experienced  and in the future could experience  quarterly variations in revenues as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include economic cycles  the timing of new contracts  the timing of increased expenses incurred in support of new business  the timing and frequency of client spending for system enhancement requests  the timing of contractual rate reductions triggered by subscriber growth or the passage of time and the seasonal pattern of the cmg business
