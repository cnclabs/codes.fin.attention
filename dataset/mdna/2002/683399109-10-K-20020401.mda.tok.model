we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of novel cancer therapies 
based on our proprietary technologies that target the molecular basis of cancer  we are developing our lead products  onyx and bay onyx is currently in a phase iii clinical trial for treatment of recurrent head and neck cancer 
in the first quarter of  we decided to modify our development plan for onyx in head and neck cancer prior to advancing onyx in the fda registration process 
therefore  we are not accelerating the phase iii clinical trial until these development modifications are complete 
in collaboration with bayer  we are in the process of completing four phase i clinical trials 
in addition  we are conducting a phase i clinical trial in canada in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia  or aml  and myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds 
we also initiated the first phase i clinical trial of bay in combination with chemotherapy agents 
we plan to initiate additional phase i and multiple phase ii clinical trials of bay in patients with various tumor types in further  on our own and as a result of our virus and small molecule collaborations  additional research and development is being conducted on potential future product candidates 
in august  we amended our collaboration agreement with warner lambert for the development and commercialization of onyx we regained full rights to develop and commercialize onyx for head and neck cancer and other cancers where local or regional administration of onyx would be feasible 
we will fund all costs associated with these efforts and will retain all profit derived from worldwide sales of onyx in these indications  subject to the potential re establishment of the original collaboration agreement 
warner lambert will retain development rights for onyx for cancers where the drug is administered intravenously 
the parties have discontinued the clinical trials for onyx administered intravenously  and onyx will utilize all available drug supply for clinical trials in head and neck cancer as well as other clinical trials involving local or regional administration 
once adequate drug supply for the intravenous trials is available  warner lambert will have the option to pursue the development and regulatory approval of onyx for intravenous administration at its own cost 
if warner lambert does not exercise its option to reinitiate clinical trials for intravenous administration  we may attempt to establish one or more collaborative relationships with other parties for the development of onyx if warner lambert exercises its option and if onyx receives marketing approval for intravenous administration in the united states  onyx and warner lambert will re establish the collaboration under the terms of the original collaboration agreement for all indications 
at that time  onyx and warner lambert will co promote onyx in the united states and canada and will share equally in any resulting profits 
in august  our small molecule research collaborations with warner lambert concluded 
we no longer receive funding for these programs nor conduct any independent research in the cell cycle and inflammation areas 
warner lambert continues to review possible clinical candidates arising from these research programs 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan and reduced the size of our workforce by approximately percent 
in addition  we put into effect various cost saving measures in all other areas of the company 
the reduction in staffing primarily impacted the research and administrative functions 
we will continue to build staff in development functions to ensure the continued development of onyx and bay key hires will continue to be made in clinical development and manufacturing 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to expenses associated with the development and commercialization of onyx in local regional indications and our co funding of the clinical development of bay with bayer 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of the onyx and bay clinical trials  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of proposed products in the foreseeable future 
we expect that all of our revenues in the foreseeable future will be generated from collaboration agreements 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the related costs are incurred and the following four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of the criteria regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectibility of those fees are based on management s judgments 
contract revenue from collaborations revenue from non refundable  up front license or technology access payments under license and collaboration agreements that are not dependent on future performance under the arrangements is recognized when such amounts are received 
if we have continuing obligations to perform  such up front fees are recognized over the period of continuing performance obligation 
contract revenue also involves onyx providing research services on a best efforts basis to certain collaborative partners 
we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with the number of full time equivalent employees working on each specific contract 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements as the related research and development costs are incurred  which is generally on a ratable basis over the contract 
deferred revenue may result when we do not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contract 
milestone payments under collaboration arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process  because we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to onyx  such as regulatory approvals  the commencement of clinical trials or selection of candidates for drug development 
amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until the related milestone is achieved 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments include determining the useful lives of fixed assets for depreciation and amortization calculations  assumptions for valuing stock options and estimated lives of license and collaboration agreements related to deferred revenue 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
our total revenues in each of the last three years were derived almost exclusively from collaborative research and development programs with warner lambert and bayer 
the approximate revenue from each of our programs  and other sources for each of the past three years was as follows year ended december  in millions warner lambert onyx and armed therapeutic viruses cell cycle inflammation bayer eli lilly and company total contract revenues all other sources total revenues total revenues decreased by million or percent from to this decrease is primarily due to the fact that we are no longer receiving reimbursement for onyx development costs from warner lambert as a result of the amended agreement announced in august for fiscal year  revenue also included million received from warner lambert upon the completion of a research milestone 
in addition  the cell cycle and inflammation collaborations with warner lambert concluded in august  and we will not receive further funding under these programs 
total revenues increased by million or percent from to primarily as a result of increased contract revenues 
total contract revenues increased in  because we recognized a full year of revenues under the warner lambert onyx and armed therapeutic virus collaboration agreement  as well as the million payment mentioned above 
this collaboration agreement was in effect for only four months of in january  our research collaboration with bayer concluded 
based on this research  we and bayer identified a development candidate  and we are co funding clinical trials with bayer 
as a result  we did not recognize any revenue in and from this program 
in june  the collaboration program with eli lilly and company expired pursuant to the terms of the agreement and as a result  we did not recognize any future revenues under this program 
we expect total contract revenues in to total between million and million primarily related to research funding from warner lambert for the armed therapeutic virus program 
research and development expenses 
research and development consists of costs incurred for independent and collaborative research and development 
below are a summary of products and the related stages of development for each product in clinical development 
the major components of research and development costs include salaries and employee benefits  clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  supplies and materials  equipment depreciation and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development results in increasing expenditures  and the timing for completion of these steps may be uncertain

million of the increased expenses related to the co development and clinical trial costs of bay with bayer 
phase i clinical trials were initiated in july  and effective with the commencement of clinical trials  we are currently co funding percent of bay clinical development costs 
research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent from this increase was primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses for the phase i clinical trials of bay and to contract manufacturing expenses as production increased to provide onyx for our various phase i ii clinical trials 
our research and development expenses in are expected to increase modestly over increased investment in onyx and bay development programs will be offset by the reductions to earlier stage research programs that were announced as part of our restructuring plan in october our product development programs may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate  or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled additional business risks 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent from the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in consulting expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent from the increase was primarily due to increased employee related expenses for the hiring of additional staff 
it is anticipated that general and administrative expenses in may decrease slightly from expenses as a result of headcount reductions that impacted the administrative functions at the end of restructuring and other 
in october  we formally adopted and announced a restructuring plan aimed at reducing future operating costs 
we recognized million of restructuring and other charges 
of the million  million related to the impairment of certain long lived assets  million related to employee termination costs  and million related to office closure costs 
we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately percent  primarily impacting the research and administrative functions 
employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation and advance notice pay 
office closure costs included losses on operating leases and asset impairments included leasehold improvements related to vacated facilities and equipment related to research and development programs not expected to continue 
restructuring and other expenses in fiscal years and were zero 
we expect operating expenses to be only slightly higher than in as a result of reductions to earlier stage research programs while increasing investment in onyx and bay development programs 
interest and other income  net 
we had net interest income of million in  and increase of million from the increase was principally due to the million follow on public offering of common stock in october and the million common stock issuance to warner lambert in march  resulting in increased cash and investment balances and thus more interest income for the current period 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from the increase was principally due to the increased cash and investment balances from the million private placement financing of common stock in january  the million common stock issuance to warner lambert in february  and the million follow on public offering of common stock in october this resulted in more interest income for the year ended december  in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx assets from our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays and compound libraries in exchange for preferred stock valued at million  which was recorded as other income 
the preferred stock value was based on recent sales of syrrx preferred stock for cash 
the chief executive officer of syrrx is a member of our board of directors 
other income for fiscal years and were zero 
income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
related party transactions in march  we issued  shares of common stock to warner lambert in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of million 
we record related party revenue under our collaboration agreements with warner lambert 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx assets from the our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays and compound libraries in exchange for syrrx preferred stock valued at million  which was recorded as other income 
the value of the preferred stock was determined based on recent sales of the syrrx preferred stock for cash 
we could also receive royalties on pharmaceutical products resulting from these assets 
the chief executive officer of syrrx is a member of our board of directors 
we have loans with certain current and former employees of which approximately million were outstanding at december  and these loans bear interest at rates ranging from to per annum 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and revenue from collaborative research and development agreements to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash and investments of million  compared to million at december   and million at december  the decrease of million in was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the sale of our common stock to warner lambert in march  which raised million 
the increase in cash and investments from to of million was attributable to several sources 
in january  we completed a private placement of common stock  which raised million 
in february  we sold common stock to warner lambert  which raised million 
in october  we raised million of net proceeds from our public offering of million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we received million of cash from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
these increases were partially offset by cash used in operations of million  the repayment of debt of million and capital expenditures of million 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development expenses necessary to support development expenses including manufacturing and clinical trial costs for onyx and for clinical development costs related to bay expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in  as compared to million in  and million in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements between million and million in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon  anticipated revenues from existing collaborations along with cost savings from the reduction in force announced in october will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through specifically  we anticipate that bayer will pay us under our collaboration agreement million during for the initiation of phase ii clinical trials for bay based on our continued co funding of development costs 
pursuant to our collaboration agreement  this amount is repayable to bayer from our share of profits and royalties 
changes in our research and development plans  revenues from collaborators or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in the expenditure of these resources before the end of  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in future periods 
we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases   this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known

sfas supersedes apb  business combinations  and sfas  accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  sfas includes provisions regarding the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   with certain early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
