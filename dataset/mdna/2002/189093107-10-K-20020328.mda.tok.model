the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview since our inception in  we have focused our efforts on developing  manufacturing and commercializing medical tissue adhesive products for use in wound closure in humans and animals 
during  dermabond adhesive continued to be our flagship product and our first dermabond adhesive line extension was launched by ethicon 
we also entered new markets as our first otc product  soothe n seal r adhesive  was launched by colgate 
closure s second otc product was introduced into the otc adhesive bandage market in the first quarter of when cpc began its consumer launch of band aid r brand liquid bandage 
also during  we strengthened our marketing and distribution channels by signing three new worldwide  exclusive  marketing  distribution and product development agreements with world class health care companies  including cpc  abbott and johnson johnson wound management 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
except for dermabond adhesive  revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment which is when title is transferred 
the sales price of dermabond adhesive is ultimately determined by the sales price of the product to the ultimate customer 
initially  we recognize revenue at an agreed upon amount per unit at the time the product is shipped 
ethicon provides a summary of its sales of dermabond adhesive on a quarterly basis  and at that time  we recognize additional revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the previously recognized amount and the actual sales price received by ethicon  as well as royalties 
advance payments received by us that relate to future sales of product or future royalties due on these sales are deferred and recorded as revenue as they are earned over future periods 
non refundable fees received upon the execution of marketing and distribution agreements for which closure has an ongoing commitment to provide product are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreement pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 
under these marketing and distribution agreements  we may receive additional milestone payments after the execution of the contract 
because these payments are based on events or achievements that may be outside of our control  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of revenue  if any  that we might receive in the future under our agreements 
potential payments under existing contracts could total million over the next two years assuming that all criteria are achieved 
the revenue related to these payments would be deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreement  which could extend as far out as for certain agreements 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of patents and licenses 
costs incurred to secure patents and obtain licenses are capitalized until either the related patent or license is issued or obtained  in which case they are amortized over the shorter of their remaining economic or useful lives  generally fifteen years for patents  or they are rejected or abandoned  in which case they are written off 
on an ongoing basis  closure evaluates the adequacy of its patent and license carrying values 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
closure evaluates its inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory on an ongoing basis 
income taxes 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally consider all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax law or rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded if realization of some portion or all of a deferred asset cannot be reasonably assured 
on a quarterly basis  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including our earnings history and existing contracts and partnerships  to determine whether it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future 
despite achieving profitability in fiscal  we believe a full valuation allowance is necessary at december  due to the limited earnings history coupled with uncertainties surrounding future market conditions 
related parties 
on january   we entered into an agreement with innocoll gmbh  of saal donau  germany  pursuant to which we pay innocoll  per year for five years 
during and   and  respectively  were paid to innocoll and  was included in accrued expenses at december  innocoll acts as closure s authorized representative in europe under the medical device directive and will provide alternative manufacturing space as needed 
two members of the company s board of directors own of the equity of innocoll 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  compared to  for product revenues increased by which is primarily due to increased shipments of dermabond adhesive 
also contributing to this increase was the launch of soothe n seal r adhesive  including a significant amount of samples  into the consumer market in the second quarter of by colgate 
license and product development revenues increased during to  from  in as revenue previously deferred was recognized ratably over the lives of various contracts with our marketing partners  including those entered into during cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was  compared to  for cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales remained fairly constant at approximately for and although sales volume increased  this percentage remained steady due to the mix of the products during which included the lower margin soothe n seal r adhesive and related samples 
we expect that future gross margins on product sales will fluctuate based on production volumes and the relative proportion of professional and otc products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses primarily consist of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses and  in  expenses related to a voluntary packaging recall 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  the development of a liquid occlusive dressing  other product development and basic research 
during  we were not involved in any clinical trials 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on clinical trials for band aid r brand liquid bandage  the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  other product development and basic research 
we expect these expenses will increase as we expand our product pipeline and related development efforts and clinical trials for potential new products  in particular our absorbable products 
overall  general and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent with the exception of salary expenses which increased during the period due to increased headcount 
also in  we recorded a special charge related to the voluntary packaging recall of three production lots of dermabond adhesive due to blister packaging seals that may have been compromised due to a mechanized packaging problem 
the related costs of this recall were estimated to be approximately  and consist primarily of costs to notify customers  cost of replacement product and shipping expenses 
interest income  net 
interest income for decreased to  from  for total interest income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of market interest rate changes during interest expense also declined due to the continued reduction of our term loan balance and capital lease obligations through monthly principal payments coupled with a decline in interest rates associated with those obligations 
income taxes 
during  tax expense was recorded for the first time by closure in the amount of  this amount represents alternative minimum taxes that cannot be eliminated through the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  including  of license and product development revenues  compared to  for product sales decreased by  from the period 
product revenues for the full year were comparable to levels but were not representative of actual market demand  nor of ethicon s sales  of dermabond adhesive 
during  ethicon continued to reduce its dermabond adhesive inventory levels that were built up during cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for decreased to  from  for cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales decreased to for from for this decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales was primarily the result of increased product yields and reduction of manufacturing costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses primarily consist of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs efforts were primarily focused on clinical trials for band aid r brand liquid bandage  the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions and other product development and basic research 
during  such efforts were focused primarily on the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions and band aid r brand liquid bandage  as well as clinical trials for soothe n seal r adhesive 
interest income  net 
interest income for decreased to  from  for total interest income decreased primarily due to interest earned from lower average cash and investment balances 
interest expense also decreased due to continued reduction of our term loan balance and capital lease obligations through monthly principal payments 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity securities  borrowings from lenders  license and product development revenues and product sales 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  which totaled million at december closure has a million line of credit  of which there were no borrowings against at december   that extends through may in addition  we have an equipment term loan of which the balance was  at december  in may when the term loan matures  the balance will be approximately  at that time  the lender may allow us to renew the loan under terms similar to the existing agreement 
if we are unable to renew  the entire balance of  will be immediately due and payable 
the term loan and line of credit agreements  which previously required us to maintain no less than fifty percent of the outstanding or committed loan balance in an investment account with the lender  were modified in december to eliminate such requirement 
our capital lease obligation at december  was  and is classified as a current liability 
upon expiration of the leases in  we are required to purchase primarily all of the equipment for the fair market value 
the fair market value  which we expect to be approximately  is to be equal to no less than and no more than of the original equipment cost 
future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are approximately million over the next six years 
capital expenditures there are no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of december  we estimate that capital investments for will approximate million 
we believe that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments together with funds generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
research and development during  closure spent approximately million in research  development and regulatory affairs expenses compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the fact that closure was not involved in any clinical trials during we continued to increase our research and development activities to maintain a competitive advantage and we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase for the next several years as we develop new products and line extensions for existing products 
we also expect that clinical trials related to new products and line extensions will be costly and represent a significant part of future expenses 
research  development and regulatory affairs expenses consist of items related to personnel  costs of supplies  clinical trials  facility costs and fees paid to consultants and outside contractors and providers and are expensed as incurred 
we are reimbursed for a fixed percentage of research and development expenses related to projects approved under cost sharing arrangements with marketing partners 
these reimbursements are recorded as a reduction in research  development and regulatory affairs expenses on a quarterly basis 
we cannot estimate the costs to complete our internal research and development projects due to uncertainties regarding successful completion of projects  clinical trial outcomes  regulatory approvals and cost sharing arrangements with partners 
we believe that funds for future research and development needs can be obtained from existing cash and investment balances and from cash generated from operations 
however  no assurance can be given that we may not require additional funds to support the completion of new product development  conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to  for the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the increase in net income during the period 
net cash used by investing activities was million during compared to cash provided by investment activities of  during the period 
the net cash used during primarily related to the purchase of fixed assets and the investment in intangible assets of approximately million offset by proceeds from investments of approximately  net cash used by financing activities was  during compared to  for our primary financing activities during both years were the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations  approximately  offset by the proceeds from the sale of stock under our stock option and other benefit plans 
based on our current plans  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  which totaled million as of december   will be sufficient to finance our operating and capital requirements for at least months 
we anticipate that our recurring operating expenses will increase for the next several years  as we expect research  development and regulatory and general and administrative expenses to increase in order to develop new products  manufacture in commercial quantities and fund additional clinical trials 
we also may invest in long term assets such as intangible assets and capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capabilities 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the following 
our ability to manufacture and commercialize successfully our lead product  dermabond adhesive  
the progress of our research and product development programs for future nonabsorbable and absorbable products  including clinical studies  
the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and marketing agreements for our future products  including the scale up of manufacturing capabilities for increased capacity in anticipation of product commercialization and development and progress of sales and marketing efforts  
our ability to maintain existing marketing agreements  including our agreement with ethicon for dermabond adhesive  and establish and maintain new marketing agreements  
our ability to achieve product development milestones  
the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights and complying with regulatory requirements  
the effect of competing technological and market developments  
timely receipt of regulatory clearances and approvals  
general acceptance of our products by the medical community and consumers  and 
general economic conditions 
we may be required to seek additional capital to finance our operations in the future 
if our currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy our financing and operating needs  we will be required to seek additional funding through bank borrowings  additional public or private sales of our securities  including equity securities  or through other arrangements with marketing partners 
other than our capital lease obligations  term loan and working capital line of credit  we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio which consists primarily of high quality short term money market funds  commercial paper and corporate bonds with an average maturity of less than one year 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding average and individual duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and investments  the majority of which had average maturities within one year 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk our international sales and related royalties of dermabond adhesive are based on sales in foreign currencies 
however  all of our sales to customers are payable in us dollars and we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
