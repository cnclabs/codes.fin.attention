critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission recently issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the best information available at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
the estimates and assumptions could change significantly as the conditions within and beyond management s control change 
therefore  actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
the most significant estimates made in preparing the financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuations  the valuation of goodwill and other intangibles  and estimates made relating to discontinued operations 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s net sales consist of sales of parts and components  the provision of component overhaul and repair services  and the provision of supply chain management services 
sales are recorded net of discounts  allowances and commissions  and are recorded generally when the parts  components  and overhauled and repaired items are shipped and title transfers to the customer  or when supply chain management services have been provided 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable  utilizing financial formulas based principally upon historical experience and the age of the account 
collection of trade receivables may be affected by aviation industry and market trends  overall economic trends and conditions  and customers credit issues and financial condition 
changes in any of these factors may have a significant impact upon the estimated allowance 
inventories inventories generally consist of general aircraft parts and components and are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
provisions are made in each period for the estimated effect of excess and obsolete inventories based upon financial formulas that take into account quantities and costs of inventory on hand  and historical and projected sales and inventory movements  adjusted for known or estimated factors such as new product lines  product return allowances and other resale outlets 
actual excess and obsolete inventories may differ significantly from such estimates  and such differences could have a significant negative impact on the financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill arises from the excess of the purchase price paid over the underlying fair value of assets acquired in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
goodwill and other intangibles were recognized upon first aviation s acquisition of api s business in and upon the acquisition of superior in there is a significant amount of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and allocate the purchase price to the underlying assets and liabilities  including the recognition of liabilities incurred directly as a result of the acquisition as well as the amortization period  if any  used to determine amortization expense 
most of the assumptions and estimates utilized in this process are based upon known factors and exposures  historical information and management s experience 
the value of goodwill and intangibles is subject to future potential adverse changes as a result of changes in the company s financial condition and results  industry and or overall economic conditions  and other factors outside of the company s control 
during the first quarter ended april   the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no

under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are estimated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of these assets is subject to estimates and judgments  and may change based upon a variety of factors  including future profitability of the company and tax law changes 
discontinued operations upon the sale or disposition of a subsidiary  management estimates what it believes to be costs to be incurred upon and after the sale or disposal of the subsidiary  including income taxes  that relate directly to the sale or disposal transaction  or the operations of the former entity

 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  there was no financial impact to the company upon compliance with the requirements of fas as of july  the company will adopt fas as of february   the beginning of its new fiscal year 
under the new rules  goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer will be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the pronouncement 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
application of the non amortization provisions of fas will not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
upon adoption of fas the company is required to perform impairment tests relating to its goodwill and other intangibles existing at the date of adoption 
the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
however  the impairment tests under fas are much different and more rigorous than those previously required under generally accepted accounting principles  especially when the book value of a company is in excess of its market value  which is the case for the company 
the company believes that there is no impairment of value  and that the principle reason for the lower market value of the company is due to the illiquidity of the company s stock  which depresses the value of each share 
under the more stringent requirements of fas  however  the company may be required to take a non cash charge to write off or write down its goodwill and other intangibles 
this charge would occur in the first quarter ending april  total goodwill and other intangibles at january  was  the amount of the non cash charge could be as much as the total amount of the net asset  or approximately per share after applicable income taxes 
any such charge would be accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the quarter ended april   and would not affect continuing operations or operating income
