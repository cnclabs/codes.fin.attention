item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company makes judgements regarding revenue recognition and evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  asset impairment  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we describe these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company generally recognizes revenue for machine sales upon shipment and installation for the initial machine model sold to a customer 
revenue is generally recognized for subsequent machine sales upon shipment  provided title has transferred and the model  configuration  and application is substantially similar to the original machine installed 
in addition  the company considers many factors in the evaluation of revenue recognition  including customer acceptance criteria  complexity of installation and integration into production lines 
revenue for manufacturing services  factory automation services  machine accessories  and spare parts are recognized upon shipment 
billable service labor revenue is recognized upon completion 
at the time of shipment  the company accrues for estimated non billable installation  training and warranty repair costs to be incurred 
critical accounting principles and estimates  cont d the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering the customer s financial condition  security deposits  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company is subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability  employee related matters  and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such assessments against the company  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
factors that may affect financial condition and future results the company operates in an industry that is highly competitive 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices by competitors  continually changing customer demand patterns  and rapid technological developments 
the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report 
o continued weak global economic conditions  or lack of electronics industry manufacturing capacity expansion  could adversely impact the company s revenues and growth rate 
o the competitive environment in the electronics assembly machine and contract manufacturing industry places pressure on revenue  gross margins and market share 
o erosion of the financial condition of customers could adversely affect the company s business 
o the availability of electronic components may be limited due to changes in demand or supply and could adversely affect the company s material costs or ability to fulfill customers order requirements 
o the inability to invest in or acquire a new venture that can absorb excess manufacturing capacity or contribute to the company s return to profitability  could adversely affect the company s business 
o the inability of the company to return to profitability could result in default on the terms of the union bank of california reimbursement agreement  which supports the stand by letter of credit guaranteeing the company s performance on the industrial development bonds 
in the event the company defaults  and is unable to present a viable turn around plan satisfactory to its bank  such event  could cause the bank to require the company to seek a substitute guarantor  re finance the building with alternative financing or sell the san marcos  california facility 
the inability of the company to successfully substitute a guarantor or to re finance the building could have an adverse effect on the company s business

two of the machines sold in represented initial sales of the new dataplace m model 
the company s through hole machines operating in the field generated most of the parts and service sales 
however  as the population of the company s through hole technology machines decline  demand for spare parts and out of warranty field service will continue to follow a parallel trend 
the aia customized factory automation unit generated  in engineering design and manufactured product sales in its first year of operation 
the first year sales included  in shipments to a major sporting equipment manufacturer 
gross profit gross profit decreased  or in  compared to this decrease was due to the lower gross profit earned on a higher mix of contract manufacturing services sales  lower factory utilization  decreased machine sales and services  and an increase to the allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the increase in the allowance for inventory obsolescence primarily consisted of  related to older technology machines  and  related to private label products selling expenses selling expenses decreased  in the current year due to aia machine products sales and service staff reductions  consolidation of sales and service offices  lower commission expense  and reduced division marketing expenses

the act extends the period in which a net operating loss may be carried back 
as a result  the company will be able to recognize a  carryback refund receivable in the first quarter of amistar industrial automation segment during  the company sold two initial customized dataplace m machines 
compared to the dataplace lp machine  the m is suitable for applications requiring less functionality and sells at a lower price 
in  the company was severely affected by the overall recession and especially the contraction in manufacturing capacity among the company s machine customer base 
many of the company s machine customers froze capital spending during in the event that the company s base of customers and potential customers move production offshore to take advantage of the lower cost of labor  the company s labor saving automation equipment may become less attractive 
the company took steps during to minimize costs in response to the recession driven decline in demand for its label identification automation equipment 
the company reduced its sales and field service support staff during the year 
at december   the company had  based on forecasts  an approximate to month supply of dataplace machine inventory

a protracted period of insufficient demand for the dataplace machines could require additional charges for reserves for partial or total obsolescence in the future 
results of operations compared to  cont d to more effectively utilize the company s existing engineering and machine manufacturing capacity in  the company formed the new aia business unit to pursue automation applications in new markets 
the new aia unit has allowed the company to penetrate new market segments including the sports equipment automation market 
contract manufacturing services segment during  despite difficult economic conditions  much of the ams sales growth came from the company s base of medical product customers who increased orders over in addition  a portion of the ams sales growth came from increased quick turn prototype services to a major test equipment customer 
considering the inefficiencies of maintaining two plants operating at less than full capacity  the company consolidated its anaheim operations with the san marcos facility to increase factory utilization 
during the fourth quarter of  the company experienced a fall off in ams sales from previous quarters due to customer order push outs and a reduction in orders from a major customer that was adversely affected by the recession and events of september  results of operations compared to company overall sales sales increased to  from  in  an increase of 
the manufacturing services division sales increased over and as a result contributed most of the overall sales growth 
the increase in label identification machine sales in was offset by the decline in the discontinued distributed surface mount machines compared to no portion of sales was due to inflation 
gross profit gross profit dollars and gross profit percent increased  and in  compared to this increase was due to the higher gross margins earned on the dataplace label identification machine  improved factory utilization and improved gross margins on contract manufacturing services 
the year was burdened with a  addition to the allowance for inventory obsolescence related to placemaster r machines  a  addition to the allowance for inventory related to private label products  and excess plant capacity in the machine division  which depressed margins 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased  in due to staff reductions  lower machine commission expense  and reduced machine division marketing expenses 
substantially all the dataplace machines were sold on a direct basis and therefore did not require a commission payment to an outside representative 
in  the machine sales were primarily comprised of sales of the smd machines  which required a commission payment as the machines were sold through outside representatives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense decreased  over the decreased expense was due partially to a  recovery in related to one of several bad debts totaling  that had been reserved for in engineering  research and development development efforts in were focused on the second dataplace r label identification machine and on customization orders received related to the dataplace r lp model 
other income expense interest income increased  in  compared to  due to higher average cash balances during results of operations compared to  cont d income taxes no federal income tax expense was recorded in due to the change in the valuation allowance 
uncertainties at december  concerning the company s ability to utilize the benefits of the deferred tax assets in the future precluded it from recording an asset at full value 
therefore a valuation allowance was recorded against the net deferred income tax asset

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to tangible long lived assets that have a legal obligation associated with their retirement and that result from the acquisition  construction or development or normal use of the assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied during the quarter ending march  to implement the provisions  the company must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption
