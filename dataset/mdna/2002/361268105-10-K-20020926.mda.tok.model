item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which are included herein 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest june the fiscal year ended july  was a week year with the extra week reported in the fourth quarter 
overview g k services  inc  founded in and headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota  is a market leader in providing corporate identity apparel and facility services programs to a wide variety of north american industrial  service and high technology companies 
we rent uniforms and other related products such as floor mats  dust mops  wiping towels  restroom supplies and selected linen items 
we also sell uniforms and other apparel items to customers in our direct sale programs 
the north american rental market is approximately billion  while the direct sales market  targeted by us  is approximately billion in size 
in fiscal  we achieved revenue growth and a increase in net income from fiscal return on average equity increased slightly to from in the prior year 
revenue growth has continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions that negatively impacted existing customer employment levels and customer turnover 
fiscal results also include the impact of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas under which goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
this change resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million for the year 
we made several small acquisitions in each of the past three fiscal years 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
the pro forma effect of these acquisitions  had they been acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year  were not material 
the total purchase consideration  including related acquisition costs of these transactions  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair values of assets acquired by approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the latest five year period  revenues grew at a rate of  compounded annually 
this result includes the weak economic conditions over the last two to three years that have negatively impacted the retention of our customer base and ability to attract new customers 
the impact of the economy on revenue has been partially offset by our focus on new product promotions  continued success in signing national accounts and acquisitions 
our five year growth rate for net income was  compounded annually 
net income was negatively impacted in both fiscal and fiscal by the difficult economy  higher energy costs and higher employee benefit costs 
in addition  we continue to focus on investments and process improvements that support future success 
these investments include new technologies focused on enhancing revenue growth and improving human resource management 
better merchandise control and lower processing costs have positively contributed to the bottom line  while garment manufacturing facilities have enhanced product quality and decreased merchandise costs 
critical accounting policies the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
estimates are used in determining the collectability of billed accounts 
table of contents receivable 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories our inventories consist of new goods and rental merchandise in service 
estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both obsolete and excess inventories 
new goods are stated at lower of cost or market  net of any reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
merchandise placed in service to support rental operations is amortized into cost of rental operations over the estimated useful lives of the underlying inventory items  primarily on a straight line basis 
estimated lives of rental merchandise in service range from nine months to three years 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers manufacturer expectations  historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
we adopted sfas at the beginning of fiscal and as a result will no longer amortize goodwill 
sfas also requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
there have been no impairments of goodwill in fiscal  or our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there have been no write downs of any long lived assets in fiscal  or insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health and workers compensation programs 
we purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect us from catastrophic losses 
estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
management estimates consider historical claims experience  escalating medical cost trends  expected timing of claim payments and actuarial analysis provided by a third party 
during  we changed certain assumptions utilized in evaluating our self insurance liability and began to apply a discounting factor to estimated future payments 
the impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations for any period presented 
changes in the cost of medical care  our ability to settle claims or the estimates and judgement used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period

total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal rental revenue rose million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal higher unemployment levels and overall weak economic conditions resulting in continued net reductions of customer employees in uniform have negatively impacted revenue growth rates 
these conditions were partially offset through the addition of new customers  penetrating existing customers with a broader mix of product and service offerings and acquisitions

the combination of improved operational productivity  lower merchandise expense and reduced energy costs have contributed to improved rental gross margin

cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of rental revenue  these costs increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase reflects higher gasoline and natural gas prices  increased employee benefit costs and the margin impact on lost revenue as a result of economic conditions during the last half of the fiscal year

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operations and borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facilities 
primary uses of this cash are interest payments on indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in net operating cash flow in fiscal was due largely to the timing of collections from customers and reductions of trade and accrued payables  excluding the effects of acquisitions 
working capital at june  was million  a million increase from million at june  this increase is largely due to reclassification of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities from current maturities to long term debt in connection with the new term loan and revolving credit facility agreement entered into on june  investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash was largely used for acquisitions 
the reductions in capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal reflect continued focus on ensuring appropriate financial return on capital resources 
financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  used cash of million in fiscal and provided cash of million in fiscal cash provided in fiscal was used primarily in acquisitions of businesses 
cash used in fiscal was primarily related to repayment of long term debt 
we paid dividends of million in each of the fiscal years  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a million term loan and revolving credit facility expiring july  to repay the existing facilities that were to expire june  the facility provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
as of june   borrowings outstanding under the term loan were million and under the revolving credit facility were million at rates ranging from to 
borrowings under this facility are unsecured 
the unused portion of the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes  acquisitions  working capital needs and to provide up to million in letters of credit 
as of june   letters of credit outstanding against the revolver were million 
in fiscal  we completed a million  private placement debt transaction with certain institutional investors 
the year notes have a seven year average life with a final maturity on july  we used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facilities and the fixed rate notes contain various restrictive covenants that among other matters require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum stockholders equity and a maximum leverage ratio  all as defined 
these debt arrangements also provide for certain limits related to additional indebtedness  investments  issuance of stock and dividends 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and only a material adverse change in our financial performance and condition could result in a potential event of default 
in the unlikely event that an event of default would be imminent  management believes that we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers  however  certain financial concessions might be required 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if amended covenants or waivers in acceptable terms could not be successfully negotiated 
cash obligations 
under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under the variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility  the fixed rate term loan  capital lease obligations and rent payments required under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year 

table of contents the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of june  for the fiscal years ending june in millions and thereafter total variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility fixed rate term loan other debt arrangements  including capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations also  at june   we had stand by letters of credit totaling million that have been issued and are outstanding  primarily in connection with our property and casualty insurance programs 
no amounts have been drawn upon these letters of credit 
at june   we had available cash on hand of million and approximately million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our cash commitments and capital requirements for fiscal and to significantly reduce the amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility  however  we may utilize borrowings under the revolving credit facility to supplement our cash requirements from time to time 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million to million 
the amount of cash flow generated from operations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in fiscal  we may actively seek and consider acquisitions of business assets  the consummation of any acquisition could affect our liquidity profile and level of outstanding debt 
we believe that available capacity under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance any such acquisitions 
impact of inflation in general  management believes that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation or  whichever is greater  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
litigation we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to personal injury  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these legal actions include lawsuits that challenge the practice of charging for certain environmental services on invoices  and being named  along with other defendants  as a potentially responsible party at certain waste disposal sites where ground water contamination has been detected or is suspected 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
table of contents  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also resolves several significant implementation issues related to sfas  such as eliminating the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment and establishing criteria to define whether a long lived asset is held for sale 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not believe that sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook the economic conditions in the united states are mixed 
based on current trends  we expect fiscal revenue to be in the range of million to million 
the compounding impact of revenue lost within our existing customer base over the past two years will continue to pressure near term earnings 
diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of to for the full year ending june   with higher earnings growth rates in the last half of the fiscal year driven by our customers improved employment levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
we use financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  as well as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a basis point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense for fiscal by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of interest rate swap agreements outstanding at june  on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the fair values were estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the current 
table of contents rate applicable to similar transactions 
for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates by fiscal year 
fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value for interest rate swaps  the following table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates by fiscal year 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
notional principal average interest average interest maturity date amount pay rate receive rate and thereafter total fair value foreign currency exchange risk we have a significant foreign subsidiary located in canada 
the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are denominated in the canadian dollar and as such are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations 
we may periodically hedge firm commitments with our foreign subsidiary  generally with foreign currency contracts 
these agreements are recorded at current market values and the gains and losses are included in earnings 
gains and losses on such transactions were not significant in fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at june  were million  all of which will mature during fiscal no amounts were outstanding under such contracts at june  or july  the fair values of the foreign currency contracts were not materially different as of june
