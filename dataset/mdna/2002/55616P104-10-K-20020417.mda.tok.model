table of contents in order to facilitate comparisons with major competitors  the company structured and finances its non proprietary credit card receivables using an off balance sheet arrangement which currently is set to expire in however  the company intends to extend the arrangement 
under this arrangement  fds bank  a subsidiary of the company  sells its non proprietary credit card receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn transfers the purchased receivables to a bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose entity the trust 
the special purpose entity has sold interests in the trust to two unrelated bank commercial paper conduit programs 
proceeds from this sale plus excess cash flow from the trust are used to buy the receivables from fds bank 
the two commercial paper conduit programs have agreed to buy interests in the trust of up to million in the aggregate 
these interests are variable and fluctuate with the level of receivables 
as of february   the gross amount of receivables in the trust was million  and the bank conduit programs held million of interests 
the trust has issued three classes of certificates class a  class b and class c certificates 
the bank conduit programs hold the class a and class b certificates and the company holds the class c certificates 
the company also holds a required seller s interest and the residual interest in the trust 
the company s interest is valued at million and is included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of february  the bank conduit programs held million in class a certificates and million in class b certificates as of february  the company held the class c certificate in the amount of million  which certificate is subordinate to the class a and class b certificates 
beyond the value of the receivables in the trust  the bank conduit programs have no recourse back to the company 
all income from the sale of the receivables to the trust is accounted for in sg a expenses 
the company s bank credit agreements require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at february   the company was well within these covenants 
management believes that the likelihood of the company defaulting on a debt covenant is not probable absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  if the company s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the company is not in compliance with any of its covenants and the company is unable to obtain a waiver  much of the company s debt would be in default and callable 
at february   the company had contractual obligations as follows obligations due by period within after total year years years years short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases off balance sheet financings letters of credit management believes the department store business and other retail businesses will continue to consolidate 
accordingly  the company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of  and investments in  department stores and other complementary assets and companies 
acquisition transactions  if 
table of contents any  are expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand and from operations and the possible issuance from time to time of long term debt or other securities 
management believes that  with respect to its current operations  cash on hand and funds from operations  together with its credit facilities  will be sufficient to cover its reasonably foreseeable working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements 
its funds from operations are impacted by the economic environment  however  the company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain its liquidity levels 
the company also relies on its  million unsecured commercial paper facility  a million on balance sheet asset backed commercial paper program relating to the company s proprietary credit card receivables and two off balance sheet asset backed bank commercial paper programs relating to the company s non proprietary credit card receivables discussed above in an aggregate amount of million  for short term liquidity 
access to the unsecured commercial paper program is dependent on the company s credit rating  a downgrade in its short term rating would hinder its ability to access this market 
if the company is unable to access the unsecured commercial paper market  it has the ability to access  million pursuant to its bank credit agreements 
of this amount   million is available pursuant to a five year committed agreement which matures in  and the remainder is available pursuant to a day committed agreement  which terminates june   and must be extended annually 
these bank credit agreements have no material adverse change condition for utilization 
the asset backed commercial paper programs are used to finance the company s proprietary and non proprietary credit card receivables 
these programs are extended annually and can be used to finance the receivables as long as the net portfolio yields remain positive 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  the company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities  or other possible capital markets transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its customer accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
delinquent accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
the company reserves for doubtful accounts based on a loss to collections rate 
at february   a percentage point change in the loss to collections rate would impact the reserve for doubtful accounts by million 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 

table of contents permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period 
such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that minimize shrinkage experience 
physical inventories are taken within each merchandise department at least twice annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
long lived asset impairment and restructuring charges the carrying value of long lived assets are periodically reviewed by the company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
for long lived assets held for use  a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long lived assets 
if estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future  the company may be required to record asset impairment write downs 
for long lived assets held for disposal  whether by abandonment or sale  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
such valuations include estimations of fair values  costs to dispose  and time periods over which to sell the assets 
in addition  liabilities arise such as severance  contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and public liability claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts the company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts 
pension and other employee benefit plans the company  through its actuaries  utilizes assumptions when estimating the liabilities for pension and other employee benefit plans 
these assumptions  where applicable  include the discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations  the rate of increase in future compensation levels  the long term rate of return on assets and the growth in health care costs 
the cost of these benefits is recognized in the financial statements over an employee s term of service with the company 

table of contents discontinued operations discontinued operations include management s best estimates of the amounts expected to be realized on the sale or wind down of assets and businesses of the fingerhut operations as well as estimates regarding the timing of those dispositions

fingerhut s other operations  including arizona mail order  figi s  and popular club plan  are anticipated to be sold as ongoing businesses by the end of fiscal year the amounts the company will ultimately realize could differ in the coming twelve months from the amounts assumed in arriving at the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations 
included in the loss on disposal  the company recorded losses related to fingerhut s core catalog accounts receivable portfolio through the four year wind down period 
the calculated loss includes estimates regarding customer payment rates  write off rates  finance charge income  late fee income  and operating expenses  such as collection costs  necessary to carry out the wind down of the portfolio 
these estimates were based on a third party offer to purchase the portfolio  historical experience and industry data where available 
the estimated loss from the fingerhut core catalog operations during the wind down period includes assumptions of revenues to be earned and estimated expenses to be incurred based on historical experience as well as through detailed departmental plans regarding the costs necessary to complete the liquidation in the planned timeframe 
losses on inventory were recognized based on estimated recovery values expected to be received from a third party liquidator 
write downs of property  plant and equipment were based on historical recovery rates for similar liquidations of personal property and brokerage quotes  where available  for real estate properties 
other assets  such as tradenames  customer lists  supplies  prepaid expenses  and capitalized software  were written down to estimated net realizable value  which in some cases was zero due to their lack of marketability 
the loss on sale of the fingerhut subsidiaries was estimated using market value quotes from an investment bank  projected net book values of each subsidiary at the expected sale dates  and expenses necessary to disconnect the subsidiaries support functions from fingerhut s core catalog operations 
severance and retention were estimated based on the current workforce  employment needs through the wind down period  employment agreements where applicable  years of service  and estimated payout based on the general severance and retention plan offered to employees 
remaining lease obligations or contractual cancellation penalties were estimated based on a review of the contract terms in place 
estimated interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations based upon the debt balances attributable to those operations
