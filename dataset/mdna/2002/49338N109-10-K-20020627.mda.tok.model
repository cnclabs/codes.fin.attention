the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  insurance  pensions and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debt 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december to april 
the impact of seasonality has reduced somewhat as keystone has become more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  general economic conditions that affect consumer spending  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary use of funds over the past two years has been for acquisitions  the development and implementation of an enterprise wide management information system and the paydown of bank borrowings 
at march   working capital was million compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is primarily the result of cash generated from operations 
the company financed its working capital requirements and the acquisitions completed during fiscal primarily from cash flow from operations 
during the year ended march   the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
this increase is the result of i an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by ii a decrease in cash used in investing activities of million  primarily as a result of cash used to purchase property and equipment primarily related to the implementation of the company s enterprise software package and cash paid for acquisitions  and a decrease in cash used in financing activities of million  primarily as a result of paydowns with respect to the company s borrowings reduced in part by an increase in cash provided from the exercise of stock options 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from the elimination of million of non cash expenses from the reported net loss of million and from adding in million of increased cash from changes in working capital components 
the most significant non cash expenses were the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  depreciation and amortization  a pretax charge with respect to the company s investment in an enterprise wide software package and a provision for a write down of inventories and accounts receivable 
the company has in place a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender that provides for a million secured credit facility that reduces to million on february  and the balance is due on february  advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus 
at march   million had been drawn down under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the loan agreement  which requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march   and at the date of the filing of this annual report 
at june   the company had drawn down million under the line of credit and the line was further reduced by a million line of credit issued in march  leaving an aggregate of million available to the company 
the increase in borrowings from march  is primarily the result of million used to complete an acquisition in april in august  the company completed the acquisition of after crash  inc  a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts based in baton rouge  louisiana 
in january  the company completed the acquisitions of iwc international  inc  a wheel cover distributor based in tampa  florida and p g products  inc and indiana distributors incorporated  distributors of aftermarket collision replacement parts  based in cincinnati  ohio and elkhart  indiana  respectively 
the aggregate cash required to consummate the acquisitions was approximately million  which was obtained through borrowings under the company s credit facility and cash flow from operations 
in addition to the cash required  the company assumed certain liabilities 
in september  the company initiated a stock repurchase program 
repurchased shares are retired and treated as authorized but unissued shares 
through march   the company had repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended march  during the year ended march   the company repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations  including the costs related to the installation of the new enterprise wide management information system see business management information systems and possible acquisitions for at least the next months 
however  the company s liquidity expectations are subject to numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
anticipated cash flow from operations are subject to the risks of the business  the most significant of which are discussed under business cautionary statements above 
especially important are the risks discussed under litigation impacting aftermarket collision replacement parts and federal and state action  above 
since the company s product sales are so dependent upon the acceptance of aftermarket parts by insurance companies  adverse verdicts or restrictive legislation could reduce sales and negatively impact cash flow from operations 
the availability of funds under the company s line of credit could also be restricted or eliminated in the event that the company does not maintain the financial ratios required under the credit agreement 
these ratios include such items as amount of indebtedness  earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  net worth and the current ratio 
in the event that the company s operations do not meet expectations it is possible that needed liquidity will not be available under the credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information about the company s obligations under non cancelable operating leases 
in march  the company caused its commercial lender to issue a million letter of credit to the company s primary insurer to secure the company s deductible reimbursement obligations 
the amount of this letter of credit reduces the funds available under its credit facility 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability 
intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at march   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
at march   goodwill  net of amortization  was million 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill test for impairment consists of a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step of the test is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
sfas no 
requires an entry to complete the first step of the transactional goodwill impairment test within six months of adopting the statement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the early adoption of sfas nos 
and effective march   the company tested its goodwill for impairment and recorded a charge of million  net of tax  retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal  accounted for as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the decrease in goodwill at the end of fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects this charge 
with sfas no 
 effective march   the company will not continue to amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization was  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectfully 
other intangible assets  consisting primarily of covenants not to compete obtained in acquisitions  which have finite lives  will continue to be amortized over the finite life 
as of march   other intangible assets amounted to million 
for the year ended march   amortization of other intangible assets was approximately million  as compared to 
million for the year ended march  other intangible assets will continue to be evaluated under sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under its credit facility  where interest rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current levels of debt  the exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material

while all transactions with taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and new taiwan dollars might impact the price of products purchased in taiwan 
the company might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
under its present policies  the company does not attempt to hedge its currency exchange rate exposure
