significant events on august   we completed our acquisition of viafone  inc  a leading provider of real time  mobile platform and out of the box mobile applications that connect field sales and service employees with critical business systems  information and processes of their enterprise 
viafone merged with and into a subsidiary of extended systems  and all outstanding shares of viafone common and preferred stock were exchanged for approximately  newly issued shares of extended systems common stock valued at approximately million in a tax free transaction 
this transaction will be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
accordingly  the results of operations of viafone will be included in our consolidated statement of operations after the completion date of the acquisition 

table of contents on june   we completed the sale of extended systems singapore pte ltd  our wholly owned singapore subsidiary  to brookhaven asia ltd  a holding company co owned by the existing management team of extended systems singapore pte ltd 
we received  in cash for all of the outstanding shares of extended systems singapore 
the singapore entity will act as an independent distributor providing marketing  sales  and support for extended systems products in southeast asia  and also plans to build product solutions based on intellectual property licensed from extended systems 
as a result of the sale  our singapore subsidiary is accounted for as discontinued operations  accordingly  such amounts for all periods in this annual report on form k  including the financial statements and related notes  have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations 
we originally acquired extended systems singapore ltd  formerly parallax research ltd  in november the singapore operation was instrumental in driving our infrared hardware business  and in managing our relationships with third party contract manufacturers in asia 
as we have continued to focus our efforts on our mobile and wireless enterprise software solutions  revenue from our hardware products has been a declining percentage of our net revenue 
as a result  the singapore entity was no longer strategic to our business 
during our fourth quarter ended june   we completed a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge to continuing operations of  in fiscal the restructuring charge consisted primarily of costs related to the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  administration and manufacturing 
approximately of the terminated employees were in the united states and were in europe and asia 
all of the restructuring charge was paid in april in august of  we continued our efforts to streamline operations and implemented an additional restructuring program 
as a result  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately  in our first quarter of fiscal consisting primarily of severance payments and related costs for approximately terminated employees in manufacturing  administration and research and development functions  primarily in the united states 
overview we classify our product offerings into one operating segment  our mobile information management segment  which consists of product solutions that extend enterprise applications to mobile and wireless environments 
the products in our mobile information management segment include data synchronization and management software  wireless connectivity products and client server database management systems with remote access capabilities 
until april  we also marketed and sold enterprise internet appliances 
we sell our mobile information management products primarily to enterprises  original equipment manufacturers  application developers and resellers both directly and through our e commerce storefronts on the internet 
we derive revenue from software license fees and royalties  support and maintenance fees  professional services  including non recurring development fees that we generate when we adapt products to customers specifications and consulting services  and sales of hardware products 
our future results of operations will be highly dependent upon the success of our software products  specifically our xtndconnect data synchronization and management software  onebridge products added from our viafone acquisition  and our xtndaccess and xtndconnect infrared and bluetooth 
table of contents wireless connectivity software 
we expect the license fees and royalties generated by these products to continue to constitute a significant majority of our revenue 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states  principally from our international sales subsidiaries  overseas original equipment manufacturers and from a limited number of international distributors 
based on the region in which the customer resides  net revenue from continuing operations may be analyzed as follows for the years ended june net revenue percentages by region domestic international europe asia other regions total international net revenue from continuing operations the increase in domestic revenue as a percentage of our total revenue from fiscal to is primarily due to a decrease in sales of our internet products in europe and a decrease in sales of our xtnd access hardware products to oem customers located in asia 
we also saw an increase in domestic sales of our advantage database server products in fiscal in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total advantage database server revenue 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue in the foreseeable future and will comprise between and of our net revenue throughout fiscal revenue generated from sales to original equipment manufacturers and to companies that license our software to include in their own software offering has fluctuated in the past 
we expect it will also fluctuate in future quarters  because demand in these markets is difficult to predict  as it is dependent upon the timing of customer projects and the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
we sell our products directly to end user customers and also market and sell many of our products through multiple indirect channels  primarily distributors and resellers 
no customers accounted for greater than of revenue from continuing operations in fiscal  or critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a material impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
the policies described below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain our significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements are highlighted below 

table of contents revenue recognition to recognize software revenue we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable  based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the shorter of our normal payment terms or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
if we had assessed the fixed or determinable criterion differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
at the time of the transaction we also assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer recognition of the fee as revenue  and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectibility differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for instance  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement that have not yet been delivered 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of any undelivered element is established by using historical evidence specific to extended systems 
for example  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts  and the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for certain of our products  we do not sell maintenance separately but do provide minimal support and bug fixes and  from time to time  minor enhancements to ensure that the products comply with their warranty provisions 
accordingly  we allow for warranty costs at the time the product revenue is recognized 
when we license our software to original equipment manufacturers or to companies that include our software in their software offering  royalty revenue is generally recognized when customers report to us the sale of software to their end user customer 
in cases where the arrangement with our customer provides for a prepaid nonrefundable royalty  we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for support and maintenance services ratably over the contract term and we generally recognize revenue from training and consulting services as these services are performed 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant customization or modification to the software 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of costs incurred in relation to the total estimated costs 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the 
table of contents total amount of work we expect to be required to customize or modify the software  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ materially from that previously reported 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  fixed assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a market capitalization approach when the information is readily available 
when the information is not readily available  we use a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model to measure any impairment 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates our measurement of any impairment may have differed materially from that reported 
income taxes on a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had recorded a valuation allowance against percent of our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
this valuation allowance was recorded based on our estimates of future us and foreign jurisdiction taxable income and our judgments regarding the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount or timing of the valuation allowance recorded may have differed materially from that reported 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to reduce the valuation allowance  potentially resulting in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the timing and amount of our reserve may have differed materially from that reported 

table of contents results of continuing operations the following section sets forth our results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june    and net revenue fiscal year ended june  change change revenue license fees and royalties services hardware and other total net revenue license fees and royalties 
license and royalty revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been delivered and accepted  in the limited number of instances where contracts contain acceptance criteria  the fee is fixed or determinable and we estimate collectibility is reasonably assured 
in those situations where we are actively participating with a reseller or distributor in the sale to an end user  we recognize revenue on a sell through basis  when the product has been delivered to the end user 
the decrease in license fees and royalties in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in revenue from our bluetooth and infrared software development kits due to the timing of original equipment manufacturer s development 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of xtndconnect server and advantage database server software licenses sold 
the increase in license fees and royalties in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to an increase in the number of licenses sold of our xtndconnect data synchronization and management software and our xtndaccess and xtndconnect infrared and bluetooth wireless connectivity software products 
we expect revenue from license fees and royalties to increase in fiscal this increase is expected to come primarily from increased licensing of our xtndconnect data synchronization and management products and from licensing of products we recently acquired from viafone 
we do not currently anticipate that bluetooth royalty revenue will be a material component of our net revenue in fiscal services 
service revenue consists primarily of support and maintenance contracts sold to our customers  and also consists of professional services 
we recognize revenue from support and maintenance contracts ratably over the stated support period  which is generally months 
our professional services typically consist of standard product installations  training  significant customization of our standard license product  or non recurring engineering 
for installations and training  we generally recognize revenue as we perform the services 
for customizations of our standard products and non recurring engineering projects  we use contract accounting to recognize revenue as work progresses 
our service revenue increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to an increase in support and maintenance revenue generated from contracts on new licenses sold and contract renewals 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from non recurring engineering and other consulting projects  which fluctuates as a result of the timing of customer projects 
the increase in service revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the increase of support and maintenance contracts sold on new licenses and contract renewals 
we expect service revenue to continue to increase in fiscal  although we expect it will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of professional services and non recurring engineering fees earned 
we are expecting an increase in revenue primarily as a result of our new strategic focus on 
table of contents professional services  as evidenced by the addition of a dedicated professional services group in the first quarter of fiscal this group is comprised of a team of professionals from viafone and of engineers formerly dedicated to development within our company 
we expect that service revenue will also increase in fiscal due to an increase in the number of support and maintenance contracts sold on new licenses and contract renewals 
hardware and other 
hardware and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our xtndaccess hardware products and our enterprise internet products 
revenue  net of estimated returns  is generally recognized from the sale of these products upon shipment to the customer 
the decrease in revenue from hardware products from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to an expected decrease in unit sales of our infrared products sold to original equipment manufacturers and a decrease in sales of our internet products 
the decrease in hardware revenue in fiscal from fiscal year was due primarily to a significant decrease in unit sales of xtndaccess irda printer adapters and our enterprise internet products 
we expect that revenue from our mobile information management hardware products will continue to decrease throughout fiscal we are currently evaluating alternatives for our hardware products and expect to restructure this business or adopt a plan for exiting this business in the first quarter of fiscal gross profit fiscal year ended june  change change gross profit license fees and royalties services hardware and other total gross profit gross margin our cost of net revenue consists primarily of costs associated with post sales support  component  labor and overhead costs of our hardware products  amortization of purchased technology  royalties for the use of third party software personnel providing professional services  and other production related activities 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in unit sales of our hardware products  which have lower gross margins than our software products 
the increase was also due  to a much lesser extent  to the cost reductions implemented throughout fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal  as described above 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales of mobile information management software products and decreased shipments of lower margin mobile information management hardware products 
we expect an increase in sales of our higher margin mobile information management software products in fiscal at the same time  we expect an increase in amortization of purchased technology as a result of our acquisition of viafone and an increase in revenue from lower margin professional services 
as a result  we expect our gross margin to be in the range of to through fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses throughout fiscal  we consolidated three of our offices in the united states and europe and  as a result  reduced operating expenses and reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
during our first quarter of fiscal  ended september   we also completed the restructuring plan that we announced in our fourth quarter of fiscal  which further reduced costs and improved operating efficiencies 
this restructuring included the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  administration and manufacturing 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed a restructuring plan that included the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  administration and manufacturing 
the effect of these and other cost saving measures are reflected in our cost of goods sold and our operating expenses for fiscal as compared to the same periods last year 
in august of  we continued our efforts to streamline operations and implemented an additional restructuring program that consisted primarily of the termination of approximately employees in manufacturing  administration  and research and development 
this restructuring will result in an increase in our cost of net revenue  to reflect personnel reassigned to our professional services team  and a decrease in our operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses fiscal year ended june  change change research and development as a of net revenue research and development expenses generally consist of salaries and other personnel costs of our research and development teams  consulting costs and facility expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of a reduction in personnel subsequent to our restructurings 
at june  we had full time equivalent research and development personnel and contractors  a decrease from the full time equivalent personnel at the same time last year 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in the number of personnel dedicated to mobile information management software projects by approximately engineers 
in fiscal  we expect our research and development costs to decrease 
increases in research and development costs associated with our recent acquisition of viafone are expected to be offset by several factors  including the sale of our singapore operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our decision to reduce investment in non strategic applications  the completion of development on old generation software and the recent consolidation of our product set 
marketing and sales expenses fiscal year ended june  change change marketing and sales as a of net revenue marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of our marketing and sales personnel  promotional expenses and pre sales support costs 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in 
table of contents marketing and sales personnel subsequent to our restructurings in fiscal and fiscal and a reduction in promotional expenses of approximately million 
at june   we had full time equivalent marketing  sales  and support personnel and contractors  as compared to full time equivalent personnel and contractors at the same time last year 
the increases in marketing and sales expenses for fiscal from fiscal were primarily due to an increase in domestic mobile information management personnel costs of approximately million and promotional expenses of approximately million  with the balance being an increase in these same costs at our european subsidiaries 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase moderately in fiscal as a result of increased sales staffing  including sales personnel added in our acquisition of viafone  although we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenue 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended june  change change general and administrative as a of net revenue general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel costs for our finance  management information systems  human resources and other administrative groups  as well as professional service fees and directors and officers insurance costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to the expenses associated with the terminated merger with palm  inc in fiscal  a  decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in personnel costs subsequent to our restructuring completed in fiscal  offset in part by an increase in legal fees of  in fiscal related primarily to the pumatech lawsuit 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of million in expenses associated with the terminated merger with palm  inc  a  increase in bad debt expense due to the impact of the decline in the worldwide economy on certain of our customers and an increase of  in the cost of our directors and officers insurance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of an increase in legal fees associated with the pumatech lawsuit  and an increase in directors and officers insurance 
we expect the increases will be partially offset by decreased personnel costs resulting from our recent restructuring in august at june   we had full time equivalent employees in administration  as compared to full time equivalent personnel at the same time last year 
no general and administrative personnel were added with our acquisition of viafone 
restructuring charges during our fourth quarter ended june   we completed a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge to continuing operations of  in fiscal the restructuring charge consisted primarily of costs related to the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  administration and manufacturing 
approximately of the terminated employees were in the united states and were in europe and asia 
all of the restructuring charge was paid in april during our fourth quarter ended june   we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  recorded a restructuring charge to continuing operations of million in fiscal the restructuring charge consisted primarily of costs related to 
table of contents the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  administration and manufacturing 
approximately were in the united states and were in europe and asia 
substantially all of the restructuring charge was paid in july a summary of the restructuring costs is outlined as follows workforce reduction costs restructuring charges in fiscal cash payments balance at june  restructuring charges in fiscal cash payments for fiscal and charges balance at june  in august of  we continued our efforts to streamline operations and implemented an additional restructuring program 
as a result  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately  in our first quarter of fiscal consisting primarily of severance payments and related costs for approximately terminated employees in manufacturing  administration and research and development functions  primarily in the united states 
amortization of intangibles fiscal year ended june  change change amortization of intangibles as a of net revenue amortization of intangibles in all periods presented is the result of goodwill that arose from our acquisitions of advance systems and rand software in our mobile information management segment 
because we are adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets beginning with our first quarter of fiscal  we do not expect to report any material goodwill amortization expense in future periods 
income tax provision benefit fiscal year ended june  change change income tax provision benefit as a of income loss before taxes the change in the income tax provision or benefit for fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of recording an income tax benefit of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal for the refund we received as a result of the temporary increase in the net operating loss carryback period created by the job creation and worker assistance act of and recording an income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal to set up a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
the change in the income tax provision or benefit for fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of a million valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal against our deferred tax assets  which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
in assessing our ability to realize deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on us generating taxable income during periods in which the temporary differences reverse 
table of contents and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire 
we recorded a valuation allowance equal to percent of our remaining deferred tax assets at june   as a result of several factors that arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal these factors were the sale of our profitable printing solutions segment in may  the decline in the overall economy and the impact it had on us and our customers in our fourth quarter  changes in our sales force that occurred in our fourth quarter  and the operating losses in our mobile information management segment 
based on these factors  and because our remaining operating segment has not been profitable  we determined that  under generally accepted accounting principles  sufficient evidence no longer existed to enable us to determine that it was more likely than not that we would be able to generate taxable income during periods in which our temporary differences reverse and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance equal to all of the remaining deferred tax assets at that time 
business combinations accounting for goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired from business combinations 
through our fiscal year ended june   our goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful life of five years using the straight line method 
beginning with our first quarter of fiscal  we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses  among other things  how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recorded in the financial statements 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized and we will cease amortizing goodwill beginning july  instead  at least annually  we will review the goodwill for impairment 
viafone on august   we completed the acquisition of viafone  a leading provider of real time  mobile platform and out of the box mobile applications that bridge field sales and service employees with the critical business systems  information and processes of their enterprise 
we acquired viafone in exchange for approximately  newly issued shares of extended systems common stock valued at approximately million in a tax free transaction 
pursuant to the merger agreement  approximately  shares of our common stock issued in connection with the merger were placed in an escrow fund to be used as the exclusive source of reimbursement to us for breaches and violations of the merger agreement or if certain financial targets are not met 
the acquisition will be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
we expect that the purchase price in excess of fair value of the net tangible assets acquired will be allocated among developed technology  acquired in process research and development  patents  customer base  and goodwill 
developed technology will be amortized over the expected life of the technology and acquired in process research and development will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents appreach in february  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of appreach  inc in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at  plus acquisition expenses of approximately  appreach  based in baltimore  maryland  specialized in the development of enterprise software that extends customer resource management crm applications to mobile and wireless devices 
a summary of the net assets acquired at the date of the acquisition is as follows net working capital property and equipment goodwill net assets acquired as of date of acquisition this transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the results of operations of the company have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
oval in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of oval limited for million in cash  including acquisition expenses  and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
we accounted for this transaction by the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations  and  accordingly  oval s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
oval  based in bristol  england  was the parent company of advance systems limited and zebedee software limited 
advance systems was the developer of xtndconnect server  formerly asl connect  a server based data synchronization and management software for portable computing devices and high end mobile phones that allows the update and exchange of data with enterprise applications such as microsoft exchange  lotus notes and corporate databases 
zebedee software was a software consulting company 
substantially all of the net assets owned by  and operations of  the oval consolidated group were attributable to advance systems  therefore  we will refer to advance systems herein when referring to the acquisition 
a summary of the net assets acquired at the date of the acquisition is as follows net working capital property and equipment developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles acquired in process research and development net assets acquired as of date of acquisition we estimated that  in aggregate  the fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was million 
we expensed the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development as a charge to operations in the first quarter of fiscal  because the projects were not complete and had no alternative future use 

table of contents we determined the value assigned to acquired in process research and development by projecting net cash flows related to future products expected to result from commercialization of the acquired in process research and development 
the net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates and excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
projected net revenue included the expected evolution of the technology and the reliance of future technologies on the in process technologies over time  but excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
we based the estimated cost of net revenue and estimated operating expenses on our cost structure and that of comparable companies 
the net cash flows were adjusted for the stage of completion of the projects and discounted to their present values based on risk adjusted discount rates of to 
the discount rates were based on various factors such as the stage of completion at the acquisition date  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  costs incurred as of the valuation date  difficulties of completing the remaining development in a reasonable time  technical uncertainties of the remaining tasks  and the costs remaining to complete the projects 
we used a portion of the acquired in process research and development to further enhance advance systems existing server based synchronization technology by implementing a plug in architecture 
this type of design allows users and third party software providers to develop small software components that plug into our xtndconnect server product and extend the range of applications supported by xtndconnect server 
in september  we implemented the first phase of this architecture with the release of xtndconnect server version  which supports ibm s db everywhere dbe handheld relational database and microsoft s activex data object ado interface  and provides other enhanced management tools 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at  as of the date of the acquisition 
we incurred an estimated  to complete version in november and december of  we released versions of xtndconnect server that support encryption  lotus notes domino r and symbian s epoc operating system 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at million at the date of the acquisition 
this project was approximately complete at the time of the acquisition and required an estimated  to complete 
we used the remaining acquired in process research and development to provide further enhancements to the architecture of our xtndconnect server products  which at the time of the acquisition were only approximately complete 
the acquired in process research and development assigned to this project was valued at  as of the date of the acquisition 
we incurred an estimated  from the date of the acquisition  to develop the in process technology into a commercially viable product 
results of discontinued operations on june   we completed the sale of extended systems singapore pte ltd  our wholly owned singapore subsidiary  to brookhaven asia ltd  a holding company co owned by the existing management team of extended systems singapore pte ltd 
the purchase price for all the outstanding shares of the company was  we originally acquired extended systems singapore ltd  formerly parallax research ltd  in november the singapore operation was instrumental in driving our infrared hardware business  and in managing our relationships with third party contract manufacturers in asia 
as we have 
table of contents continued to focus our efforts on our mobile and wireless enterprise software solutions  revenue from our hardware products has been a declining percentage of our net revenue 
as a result  the singapore entity was no longer strategic to our business 
on may   we sold our printing solutions segment  which included our network print server and non network printer sharing products to troy group  inc for million in cash  net of expenses 
we sold our printing solutions segment to troy because the segment was not consistent with our core business strategy  which focuses on mobile information management solutions 
as a result of the reclassification of our printing solutions segment and our singapore subsidiary as discontinued operations  operating results for our printing solutions segment and our singapore subsidiary are reported  net of tax  under income from discontinued operations on our statements of operations 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes gain loss on sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes the decrease in net revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of there being no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal and of a significant decrease in revenue in our singapore subsidiary from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was principally due to decreased unit sales of both network print server products and non network printer sharing products in our printing solutions segment and decreased unit sales of our xtndaccess hardware products in our singapore subsidiary 
income from our discontinued operations decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of there being no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal and as a result of the decrease in income generated by our singapore subsidiary due to decreased sales to hewlett packard 
the income from our discontinued operations decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of the significant decrease in income from our singapore subsidiary and a decrease in gross profit in our printing solutions segment resulting from a decrease in unit sales of our printing solutions products 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income from our printing solutions segment resulting from a decrease in operating expenses as we continued our shift in focus from our printing solutions products to our mobile information management products 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash used by operating activities fiscal year ended june  net cash used by operating activities net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss and the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  adjusted for such non cash items as depreciation and amortization 
these cash uses were partially offset by a decrease in receivables and inventories  and an increase in deferred revenue 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was 
table of contents primarily a result of our net loss  adjusted for such items as the change in deferred taxes and to our depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debts and provision for write down of inventory 
this cash use was partially offset by a decrease in receivables  an increase in payables and a decrease in inventory 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily a result of the payment of the discount upon maturity of our long term debt and an increase in receivables  principally income taxes receivable 
these cash uses were partially offset by our net loss  adjusted for such items as depreciation and amortization and acquired in process research and development  and a decrease in inventory 
accounts receivable  net of allowance  were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in dsos days sales outstanding  a decrease in total net revenue and particularly a decrease in net revenue from original equipment manufacturers 
we expect that our accounts receivable will increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in net revenues 
accounts receivable may also increase in the future if net revenue from original equipment manufacturers and international customers becomes a higher percentage of our net revenue because these customers generally have longer payment cycles 
net cash provided used by investing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided used by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our singapore subsidiary net of cash sold with the entity 
these proceeds were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
as part of our effort to control cash and expenses  we did not make a significant investment in property and equipment in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operations  which consisted of our printing solutions segment  and proceeds from the sale of our facility in bozeman  montana 
these proceeds were offset  in part  by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of cash payments for the acquisition of oval  the parent company of advance systems 
we plan to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal  primarily for software  system improvements and personal computers 
we expect our cash position will increase in the first quarter of fiscal by million as a result of the closing of the viafone acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  partially offset in fiscal by payments on our long term debt 
we had no long term debt in fiscal on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  under which we can currently access up to million of financing in the form of a demand line of credit  subject to current accounts receivable balances 
the line of credit is collateralized by certain of our 
table of contents assets 
interest on any borrowings will be paid at prime plus one percent but not less than 
the line of credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and expires on january  to date we have no draws on this line of credit 
upon completion of our acquisition of viafone on august   we assumed million of term debt with silicon valley bank 
we have restructured that debt into a term loan due in equal monthly installments bearing interest at 
the term loan is collateralized by certain of our assets  requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and is scheduled to be paid in full by march we believe that our existing working capital and borrowing capacity  the funds we expect to generate from our operations and the cash we acquired in the viafone merger will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if inventory  accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity could include borrowing against our line of credit or offering additional equity securities  which could result in dilution to our stockholders  or additional debt financing 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  companies with complementary products  technologies or distribution networks in order to broaden our mobile information management product offerings 
we currently have no commitments or agreements regarding any material transaction of this kind  however  we may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
as a result  we may require additional financing in the future and  if we were required to obtain additional financing in the future  sources of capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales  principally through our international subsidiaries and through a limited number of independent distributors and overseas original equipment manufacturers 
sales made by our international subsidiaries  excluding our former singapore subsidiary  are generally denominated in each country s respective currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates could cause our results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into united states dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates also may make our products more expensive to original equipment manufacturers and independent distributors who purchase our products in united states dollars 
in participating countries  we have completed the transition of our product prices to the european single currency  the euro  and have converted financial systems from local denominations to the euro 
we did not experience significant costs to make the transition and all such costs were expensed to operations as they were incurred 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the british pound sterling and euro  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset or liability being managed  resulting in minimal net exposure for us 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated 
table of contents or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
we had million and million in forward contracts in place  which approximated fair value  against the euro and british pound sterling at june  and  respectively  which matured within days 
we recognized net currency exchange losses of   and  for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we are required to adopt in our first quarter of fiscal ending september  this statement requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill for which we had recorded approximately  of amortization expense during fiscal and for which we would have recorded approximately  of amortization expense during fiscal in lieu of amortization we will be required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we expect to complete the initial review during the first quarter of we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review  however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes various existing standards on accounting for long lived assets 
this new standard establishes a single accounting method under which long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  this statement expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business 
we are required to adopt this statement in our first quarter of fiscal ending september  we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this new standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or 
table of contents disposal plan 
costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the amount of any liability to be recorded for the costs covered by this standard  however  the time at which the liability will be recognized may be affected 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have a recent history of losses and anticipate continued losses in fiscal since the third quarter of our fiscal  we have devoted significant financial resources to the research and development of  and marketing and sales for  our mobile information management software products and  as a result  we have generated operating losses 
we intend to continue to devote significant financial resources to product development and marketing and sales and  as a result  we expect to continue to incur operating losses and may incur negative cash flow from operations through at least the end of our first quarter of fiscal we currently believe that we will generate positive cash flow from operations for our second quarter of fiscal our ability to reach positive cash flow from operations  and our ability to maintain positive cash flow from operations in subsequent periods  will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate sufficient revenue and control expenses  our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition of viafone while minimizing the costs of integrating our business operations and products  buying patterns of our corporate information technology and original equipment manufacturer customers  changes in customer demand for our products  the market adoption rate of bluetooth or other technologies on which a number of our products are based  announcements or introductions of new products or services by our competitors  the outcome of our dispute with pumatech  inc and the impact of any litigation on our financial and management resources  delays in our development and introduction of new products and services  changes in our pricing policies as a result of increased competition  the mix of distribution channels through which we sell our products  the market acceptance of our new and enhanced products and the products of our original equipment manufacturers  the emergence of new technologies or industry standards  normal seasonality that we experience in the first quarter of our fiscal year  the timing of customer orders  which can be influenced by fiscal year end buying patterns  seasonal trends or general economic conditions  and a shift in the mix of our products sold  which may result in fluctuations in our gross margin 
we may not realize the benefits of our recent acquisition of viafone  inc whether we realize the benefits of our acquisition of viafone will depend on our ability to integrate the people  operations  technology and products of viafone in a timely  efficient and effective manner 
integrating viafone will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may result in revenue disruption  operational difficulties and diversion of management resources 
successful integration of viafone will be affected by the following we may be unable to successfully coordinate our software development operations with those of viafone in a rapid and efficient manner  resulting in a delay in our releasing products to the market  
table of contents we may be unable to combine our product offerings and product lines with those of viafone quickly and smoothly  resulting in our having to spend additional time or money on integration of products and technology  we may be unable to successfully demonstrate the benefits of the combined company s product line to our customers  resulting in delay or deferral of purchasing decisions by our customers  our management may spend too much time on integration issues  resulting in the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  including product development  marketing and operations  we may be unable to retain and motivate key employees  resulting in delays and disruptions in integrating viafone s operations  products and technology and additional costs associated with recruiting and training replacement employees  we may be unable to retain key alliances  resulting in an impairment of our ability to achieve our product development and marketing objectives  we may be unable to integrate our business culture with that of viafone  resulting in additional costs and delays in integrating viafone s operations and employees  and we may discover unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business and technology of viafone  resulting in unforeseen business expenses and delays in product development 
if we do not successfully integrate viafone in a timely  efficient and effective manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business relies on enterprises implementing mobile applications and devices and may be harmed by declines in information technology spending 
the market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader economic climate and spending on information technology  including mobile applications and devices 
downturns in the overall economy may cause enterprises to delay implementation of mobile device and application rollouts  reduce their overall information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
our original equipment manufacturer customers may also limit development of new products that incorporate our products or reduce their level of purchases of our products in the face of slower information technology spending by their customers 
we have seen a severe downturn in the worldwide economy in the past year 
we expect this downturn to continue and are uncertain as to the severity and duration of the downturn 
in particular  capital spending in the information technology sector generally has decreased in the past months and many of our customers and potential customers have experienced declines in their revenue and operations 
in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty or cease operations 
while we believe we have adequately factored these conditions into our current revenue forecasts  if these conditions worsen or continue longer than expected  demand for our products may be further reduced as a result of enterprises reducing information technology spending on our products and original equipment manufacturers reducing their use of our products in their own products 
as a result  our revenue may fail to grow or decline  which would harm our operating results 
if the current economic slowdown persists or worsens  we also may be forced to reduce our operating expenses  which could result in additional charges incurred in connection with restructuring or other cost cutting measures we may implement 
for example  on april   we announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  incurred approximately  in restructuring costs in our fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily for severance payments to terminated employees 
in addition  in august of  we continued our efforts to streamline operations and implemented an additional restructuring program 
as a result  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately  in our first quarter of fiscal consisting primarily of severance payments and related costs for terminated employees 

table of contents our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly and fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenue and operating results will vary from quarter to quarter for many reasons beyond our control  including those described in this section 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our stock may fall 
in addition  quarter to quarter variations in our revenue and operating results could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
we forecast many of our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue and gross profit  which is difficult to predict 
if we fail to accurately predict revenue and gross profit in a particular period  we may be unable to adjust our expenditures in that period and our operating results would be harmed 
our quarterly revenue and operating results currently depend in large part on the volume and timing of orders received within the quarter and on the number of software seats licensed  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue results from the sale of products to a number of resellers and distributors  which are difficult to predict 
significant portions of our expenses are related to personnel and  therefore  are fixed in advance  based in large part on our forecast of future revenue 
if revenue and gross profit are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust personnel and other expenditures to compensate for the shortfall 
if the markets for our products do not continue to grow or do not grow at expected rates  demand for our products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
the success of our products currently will rely to a large degree on the increased use by individuals and enterprises of mobile devices  including personal digital assistants  cell phones  pagers and laptop and handheld computers  and on increased use of technologies such as syncml and bluetooth 
even if markets for our products grow  our products may not be successful 
enterprises and original equipment manufacturers may not develop sufficient confidence in mobile devices to deploy our products to a significant degree 
any inability to continue to penetrate the existing markets for mobile data management and wireless connectivity product solutions  the failure of current markets to grow  new markets to develop or these markets to be receptive to our products and technologies on which our products are based  could harm our business 
the emergence of these markets will be affected by a number of factors beyond our control 
we depend on a number of key business relationships and if we fail to maintain these relationships  or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
an important element of our strategy is the development of key business relationships with other companies that are involved in product development  joint marketing and the development of mobile communication protocols 
if we fail to maintain our current relationships or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
some of these relationships impose substantial product support obligations on us  which may not be offset by significant revenue 
the benefits to us may not outweigh or justify our obligations in these relationships 
also  in order to meet our current or future obligations to original equipment manufacturers  we may be required to allocate additional internal resources to original equipment manufacturers product development projects  which may delay the completion dates of our other current product development projects 
our existing key business relationships do not  and any future key business relationships may not  provide us any exclusive rights 
many of the companies with which we have established and intend to 
table of contents establish key business relationships have multiple strategic relationships  and these companies may not regard their relationships with us as significant 
in most of these relationships  either party may terminate the relationship with little notice 
in addition  these companies may attempt to develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
they may do so on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
further  our existing business relationships may interfere with our ability to enter into other business relationships 
markets for our products are becoming increasingly competitive  which could result in lower prices for our products or a loss of market share 
we may not compete successfully against current or future competitors  some of whom have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share and a change in our business and marketing strategies  any of which could harm our business 
the competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products  pricing  licensing  services or marketing to maintain and extend the market acceptance of our products 
price concessions or the emergence of other pricing or distribution strategies by our competitors or us may diminish our revenue 
we compete with mobile data management companies  including synchrologic  aether systems  pumatech avantgo and ianywhere  a division of sybase  client server database providers  including microsoft  interbase  pervasive software and oracle  mobile connectivity companies  including widcomm  open interface and ivt corporation  and internal research and development departments of original equipment manufacturers  many of whom are our current customers 
as the markets for mobile information management products grow  we expect competition from existing competitors to intensify 
we also expect new competitors  including original equipment manufacturers to which we sell our products  to introduce products that compete with ours 
we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and short product life cycles 
any delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business 
the product development process involves a number of risks 
development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 

table of contents if specific industry wide standards and protocols  such as bluetooth  syncml and irda  upon which our products are or will be based  do not achieve widespread acceptance  our business would be harmed 
we have designed a number of our current and upcoming products to conform to industry standards and protocols  such as bluetooth  a short range radio communication protocol  syncml  a data synchronization protocol  and irda  a wireless communication protocol created by the infrared data association 
if these standards and protocols do not achieve acceptance  our business would be harmed 
even if accepted  these industry wide specifications may not be widely adopted  or competing specifications may emerge 
in addition  technologies based on these standards and specifications may not be adopted as the standard or preferred technologies for wireless connectivity  thereby discouraging manufacturers of personal computers and mobile devices from bundling or integrating these technologies in their products 
we may not be able to adequately protect our patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights from competitors  and we may be required to use a significant amount of our resources to defend ourselves from infringement claims made by others 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents  trademarks and copyrights might not provide us with any competitive advantage  which could harm our business 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we are seeking  if at all 
in addition  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around our patents 
further  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some countries outside of the united states 
companies in the software industry frequently resort to litigation over intellectual property rights 
if a court finds that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities  which could harm our business 
as a result  we might be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling specific products or using specific processes 
holders of patents and other intellectual property rights may not offer licenses to use their patents or other intellectual property rights on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all could harm our business 
for instance  on april   pumatech  inc filed a patent infringement action against us in the us district court in northern california 
an amended complaint was filed on may  the action alleges that our xtndconnect server and desktop synchronization products infringe on seven of pumatech s synchronization related patents  that our alleged use of the trademark satellite forms constitutes trademark infringement  and that other alleged actions constitute unfair competition and interference with contract 
the action seeks an injunction against further sales of our server and desktop synchronization products and use of the allegedly infringing trademark  as well as unspecified damages and attorneys fees 
we believe that pumatech s claims are without merit  and we intend to defend the suit vigorously 
on june   we filed an answer and counterclaim in response to pumatech s complaint in which we deny pumatech s charges  raise a number of affirmative defenses and request a declaration from the court that pumatech s synchronization software patents are invalid and not infringed by our product 
however  litigation is inherently uncertain  and we may not prevail in our defenses or counterclaims 
in addition  litigation is frequently expensive and time consuming  and management may be required to spend significant time defending the suit  such costs and the diversion of management time could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while 
table of contents business 
while management currently believes the amount of the potential liability  if any  with respect to this action will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity  the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain 
we cannot estimate the costs of any potential settlement 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  the impact could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
in order to protect our proprietary rights  we may decide to sue third parties 
any litigation  whether brought by or against us  could cause us to incur significant expenses and could divert a large amount of management time and effort 
a claim by us against a third party could  in turn  cause a counterclaim by the third party against us  which could impair our intellectual property rights and harm our business 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions  and any acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate with our business  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or adversely affect our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions  our business would be harmed 
we may not be able to properly evaluate the technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and difficulties  including the integration of acquired technologies with our existing products and technologies  diversion of management s attention and other resources to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  availability of equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us and our stockholders  integration of management information systems  personnel  research and development  and marketing  sales and support operations  expansion into new markets and business areas  potential adverse short term effects on our operating results  and retention of customers post acquisition 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders investments may be diluted  which could affect the market price of our stock 
international sales and operations represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
our business may be harmed due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
in fiscal year  based on the region where the customer resides  of our revenue was generated from international sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in government regulations  export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country and lead to a reduction in sales in that country  longer collection and payment cycles than those in the united states  difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  and political and economic instability  including military and terrorist actions 
we depend on non exclusive licenses for some of the technology we use with our products 
we license technology on a non exclusive basis from several companies for use with our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  we license authentication and 
table of contents encryption technology from certicom corporation  which we include in our xtndconnect server products 
our inability to continue to license this technology  or to license other technology necessary for use with our products  could result in the loss of  or delays in the inclusion of  important features of our products or result in substantial increases in royalty payments that we would have to pay pursuant to alternative third party licenses  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of licensed software in conjunction with our products 
any undetected errors in products resulting from this licensed software may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the transactions made through our subsidiaries in france  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom are primarily denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  these international operations expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into united states dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the euro and british pound sterling  to manage currency fluctuations on payments and receipts of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the complex computer software and hardware products that we produce may contain defects for which we may be liable 
the complex software and computer hardware products we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
these errors could result in dissatisfied customers  product liability claims and the loss of or delay in market acceptance of new or enhanced products  any of which could harm our business 
testing of our products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy our products 
for example  our mobile information management products are used in a wide variety of telecommunications environments 
changes in technology standards or an increase in the number of telecommunications technologies used in the marketplace may create compatibility issues with our products and our customers environments 
accordingly  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors could be found after commencement of commercial shipment 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could result in our payment of significant legal fees and damages  which would harm our business 
our stock price may be volatile and could drop significantly  resulting in the partial or total loss of a stockholder s investment 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may cause a stockholder s investment to decrease in value 
the following factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements of acquisitions by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  sales of significant numbers of shares within a short period of time  the outcome of our litigation with pumatech  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the computer and mobile device industry  general economic conditions and their impact on corporate information technology spending  price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets in general  announcements and updates of our business outlook  and changes in security analysts earnings estimates or recommendations regarding our competitors  our customers or us 
substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold causing our stock price to decline significantly when the shares of stock issued in connection with the viafone acquisition are released from their lock up agreements 
a substantially large number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the public market within short time periods at various dates following the close of the merger on august  as a result  our stock price could fall 
of the approximately  shares of extended systems common stock issued in connection with this merger  approximately  shares were immediately available for resale by the former stockholders of viafone and  shares of extended systems common stock are subject to lock up agreements that restrict the timing of the resale of these shares 
under the lock up agreements   shares will be released and available for sale in the public market on february   six months after the closing date of the merger  an additional  shares will be released and available for sale in the public market on may   nine months after the closing date of the merger and an additional  shares  of which are subject to an escrow arrangement will be available for sale in the public market on august   months after the closing date of the merger and at anytime thereafter 
up to an additional  shares may be released from the escrow fund under the merger agreement and available for sale months from the closing date of the merger 
in comparison  the average daily trading volume of our common stock for the five day period ending on august  was  shares 
while rule under the securities act may impose some limitations on the amount of shares certain viafone stockholders may sell  sales of a large number of newly released shares of extended systems common stock could occur that could result in a sharp decline in our stock price 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business will suffer 
growth in our business may place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increase demands on our systems and controls  which could harm our business 
growth may also result in an increase in the scope of responsibility for management personnel 
we anticipate that our growth and expansion will require that we recruit  hire  train and retain new engineering  executive  sales and marketing personnel 
difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel could require us to incur significant costs to recruit personnel or could limit our ability to grow 
in addition  in order to manage our growth successfully  we will need to continue to expand and improve our operational  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to do so could harm our business 
the loss of key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel  may harm our business 
our success depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and finance personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the loss of key personnel could harm our business 
in our first quarter of fiscal  we completed a restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed an additional 
table of contents restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately additional employees 
in our first quarter of fiscal  we completed a further restructuring program  which resulted in the elimination of an additional employees 
despite this reduction in workforce  we will continue to recruit personnel with the specific technical skills that are critical to our business 
for example  throughout fiscal we expect to hire additional sales personnel in order to capitalize on market opportunities 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of us  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  each serving a staggered three year term  and does not permit action by written consent of the stockholders or cumulative voting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
while we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
all of our liquid investments mature within days or less of june   therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of liquid investments is minimal 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and other currencies could materially harm our business 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the british pound sterling and euro  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset or liability being managed  resulting in minimal net exposure for us 
the success of these hedging activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
we had million and million in forward contracts in place  which approximated fair value  against the euro and british pound sterling at june  and  respectively  which matured within days
