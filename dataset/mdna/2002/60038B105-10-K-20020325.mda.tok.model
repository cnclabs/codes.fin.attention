item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
unless otherwise indicated  all information that we present in this form k for any date or period gives effect to the conversion as if it had occurred on that date or as of the beginning of that period and all references to common stock for periods before the conversion mean our issued and outstanding membership interests 
overview we have patented and developed a proprietary process called hydrogen on demand tm that safely generates pure hydrogen or electricity from environmentally friendly raw materials 
in the process  the energy potential of hydrogen is carried in the chemical bonds of sodium borohydride  which in the presence of a catalyst releases hydrogen or produces electricity 
the primary input components of the reaction are water and sodium borohydride  a derivative of borax  which is found in substantial natural reserves globally 
hydrogen from this system can be used to power fuel cells  as well as fed directly to internal combustion engines 
we also have a patented design for boron based longer life batteries 
our goal is to convert our technology from the research and development stage to commercialization 
such potential revenue for the next several years is likely to include upfront license fees  sales of prototypes  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies or through collaborations with other companies  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
we have not generated any commercial revenue to date but expect to recognize our first revenue in the first quarter of we incurred operating losses of   and  in  and  respectively  and we had a net loss applicable to common stockholders of   and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had an accumulated deficit of  and  respectively 
the following table disaggregates the company s net operating losses from incurred non cash charges and preferred dividends net loss non cash excluding charges and accumulated non cash charges preferred dividends deficit period from january  inception to june     period from july  to december  period from january  to december  cumulative amount from inception    our initial public offering was completed on august  our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to employee stock options  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  versus total revenues 
during and  we did not recognize any revenues related to the sale or license of our technology 
we expect our first revenues to be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal product development and marketing expenses 
product development and marketing expenses were  for the year ended december  these expenses include business development and marketing activities and efforts to customize our technology in accordance with agreements with partners as well as for general business development 
we did not incur product development and marketing expenses in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  this was due largely to the full year impact of our financial  administrative and investor relation organizations including salary and related benefits costs established during the latter half of occupancy costs also increased as we tripled the size of our facilities in we do not expect significant future increases in general and administrative expenses from those incurred in non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  non cash charges recorded in were related to continuing amortization of below market options granted to employees and non employee board members in of  and the fair value of warrants issued to affiliates in of  non cash charges for the year ended december  included a non cash compensation charge of  for the grant of company stock options to employees and non employee board members below market  the fair value of warrants issued to affiliates of  and  for the issuance of common stock in connection with the termination of the royalty agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  this increase in depreciation and amortization is related to the addition of certain laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements in our newly expanded facilities 
we expect depreciation and amortization to continue to increase as we invest in additional leasehold improvements and equipment to support our lab expansion plans 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase is primarily attributable to increased staffing and research projects as required to further the development of our technology 
interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in interest income is primarily the result of higher average balances in resulting from the proceeds of the initial public offering in august coupled with our long term investment strategy established in january preferred stock amortization 
preferred stock amortization of  for the year ended december  represents a non cash charge to the common stockholders in connection with the may issuance of the preferred stock at less than the initial public offering price  which was converted into common stock in august year ended december  versus total revenues 
during and  we did not recognize any revenues related to the sale or license of our technology 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in general and administrative expenses was related to the development of a corporate infrastructure and staffing to support regulatory reporting  benefit programs and investor relations activities 
non cash charges 
non cash charges for the year ended december  included a non cash compensation charge of  for the grant of company stock options to employees and board members below market  the fair value of warrants issued to affiliates of  and  for the issuance of common stock in connection with the termination of the royalty agreement 
there were no such charges in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  this increase in depreciation and amortization is related to the addition of certain laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase is primarily attributable to increased staffing required to further the development of our technology 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  in  an increase of  the change in net interest income was primarily the result of higher interest income related to a larger average cash balance resulting from the proceeds of the initial public offering in august preferred stock amortization 
preferred stock amortization of  for the year ended december  represents a non cash charge to the common stockholders in connection with the may issuance of the preferred stock at less than the initial public offering price  which was converted into common stock in august liquidity and capital resources since the inception date  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in august and private placements of equity securities 
in  we issued  of membership interests in millennium cell llc for cash  which subsequently were converted into our common stock as of april  we also received a capital contribution of  in the first quarter of  and in may  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock  which automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering totaled approximately million 
in october  we received million in cash from ballard power systems inc ballard as an advance for prospective royalties pursuant to a product development agreement between us and ballard 
under certain circumstances  a portion of this advance may be refundable to ballard 
in addition  we have granted ballard a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
upon completion of product development  these warrants will be recorded at fair value 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and held to maturity investments 
cash used in operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and related to funding our net operating losses  partially offset by the advance for prospective royalties discussed above 
in connection with the company s amended lease agreement  the company issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of cash security deposit 
the letter of credit was collateralized with a portion of the company s cash  which is classified as other assets 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
investing activities used cash of   and  in  and  respectively 
investing activities consisted primarily of held to maturity investments in high grade government bonds and bank certificates of deposit  purchases of laboratory equipment necessary for the continuation of our research and development activities  and additional patent registration costs 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in product development  marketing  research and development  and leasehold improvements to our facilities and equipment to complete our facilities expansion 
we will continue to register and pursue patents on our technology 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our fuel cell technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net income in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which begins in june  ranges from to of net income over a ten year period and shall not exceed of the original grant 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs of our operations into we may seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or  even if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company s near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation technology  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
it is anticipated that revenues will be recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
stock options the company has recorded non cash charges in and to the fair value of warrants issued to certain affiliates and third parties 
certain affiliates have the ability to earn new awards based on defined milestones and service periods 
the accounting methodology requires a re valuing of the related earned warrants at each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
due to this variable accounting methodology  it is difficult to predict the amount of additional non cash charges the company will incur related to these warrants 
the fair value of the company s options and warrants issued to affiliates was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company also records non cash charges for the difference between the grant price and market price on the date of grant related to certain stock options issued to employees and elected directors below market prices as defined by apb no 
the non cash charge is recognized ratably over the related vesting period of the respective option contracts 
the company also discloses pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options granted for the fiscal years ended december  and has been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
the company s options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
due to these highly subjective assumptions  the non cash charges incurred in and for warrants issued to affiliates and the pro forma disclosures of net loss and loss per share for fiscal  and  are not likely to be representative of non cash charges and the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share  respectively  in future years 
disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our systems ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these agreements to protect against price increases 
investment considerations the company has decided to make disclosures in accordance with item of sec regulation s k of important qualitative risk factors which should be considered along with those described in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission prior to making an investment in our common stock 
our business  the results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be harmed by any of the following factors we are a development stage company  which has only been in business for a short time 
in addition  many aspects of our business plan rest on beliefs formed by our management and have not necessarily been supported by independent sources 
as a result  your basis for evaluating us is limited 
we have incurred substantial losses and expect losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve profitability  and even if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we expect our future operating results to vary significantly quarter to quarter  and increase the likelihood that we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time 
future issuances of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we may be subject to litigation if our common stock price is volatile  which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resource and could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to raise additional capital to complete our product development and commercialization plans 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may be on unacceptable terms to us  may dilute your ownership or may restrict our ability to run our business 
we may be unable to complete development of commercially viable hydrogen generation systems 
our hydrogen generation systems may only be commercially viable as a component of other companies products  and these companies may choose not to include our systems in their products 
the cost of our hydrogen generation systems needs to be lowered and we need to demonstrate their reliability or our commercialization plans may be hindered 
any perceived problem while conducting demonstrations of our technology could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products  which would impede the development of our business 
some of the raw materials that the hydrogen generation systems use are expensive and are not manufactured in large quantities 
therefore  the energy produced by our systems may cost more than energy provided through conventional and alternative systems 
accordingly  our systems may be less attractive to potential users 
if we cannot develop and demonstrate lower cost processes for the manufacture of sodium borohydride  our commercialization plans may be hindered 
a mass market for sodium borohydride fuel cells  hydrogen generation systems or batteries may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate 
we are heavily dependent on companies or governmental agencies that would include our hydrogen generation systems in their products and to develop the infrastructure required to use of our technologies in certain applications or markets 
failure to meet cost or performance goals with potential customers could delay or impede commercialization of our technology 
changes in environmental policies could result in automobile manufacturers abandoning their interest in fuel cell powered vehicles 
this may substantially lessen the market for our products and harm the development of our business 
since zero emission vehicle requirements can be met without using our sodium borohydride fuel cells  automobile manufacturers may use other technologies to meet regulatory requirements 
any accidents involving our products or the raw materials used in our products could impair their market acceptance 
we have no experience manufacturing batteries on a commercial basis 
therefore  we may be unable to complete a commercially acceptable battery 
we will continue to face intense competition from alternative power technologies and may be unable to compete successfully 
we depend on our intellectual property and may not be able to protect the rights to that intellectual property 
our failure to protect this intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 
our future plans could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel 
we do not intend to pay any dividends
