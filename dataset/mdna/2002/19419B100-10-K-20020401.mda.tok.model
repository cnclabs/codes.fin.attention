item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview collagenex pharmaceuticals  inc and subsidiaries is a specialty pharmaceutical company currently focused on providing innovative medical therapies to the dental and dermatology markets 
our first product  periostat  is an orally administered  prescription pharmaceutical product that was approved by the united states food and drug administration in september and is the first and only pharmaceutical to treat adult periodontitis by inhibiting the enzymes that destroy periodontal support tissues 
we are marketing periostat to the dental community through our own professional dental pharmaceutical sales force of approximately sales representatives and managers 
pursuant to an exclusive license and marketing agreement with atrix laboratories  inc  we began  in october  to actively market atrix s proprietary dental products  atridox  atrisorb freeflow and atrisorb d  to the united states dental market 
we distribute periostat through drug wholesalers and large retail chains in the united states and the united kingdom 
the atrix dental products are distributed through a specialty distributor who sells these products directly to dental practitioners in the united states 
our sales force also co promotes vioxx  a prescription non steroidal  anti inflammatory drug developed by merck co  inc  in the united states 
we began operations in january and functioned primarily as a research and development company until during this period  we operated with a minimal number of employees  and substantially all of our pharmaceutical development activities were contracted to independent contract research and other organizations 
following fda approval of periostat in september  we significantly increased our number of employees  primarily in the areas of sales and marketing 
we continue to contract our research and development activities as well as manufacturing  warehousing and distribution functions 
we have incurred losses each year since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not based on historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of those terms 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our business of selling  marketing and developing pharmaceutical products is subject to a number of significant risks  including risks relating to the implementation of our sales and marketing plans for periostat and other products that we market  risks inherent in research and development activities  risks associated with conducting business in a highly regulated environment and uncertainty relating to clinical trials of products under development 
our success depends to a large degree upon the market acceptance of periostat by periodontists  dental practitioners  other health care providers  patients and insurance companies 
periostat has been approved by the fda for marketing in the united states and approved by the medicines control agency for marketing in the united kingdom 
there can be no assurance that any of our other product candidates will be approved by any regulatory authority for marketing in any jurisdiction or  if approved  that any such products will be successfully commercialized by us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will successfully commercialize vioxx  atridox  atrisorb freeflow and atrisorb d 
as a result of these risks  and others expressed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
results of operations from our founding through the quarter ended september   we had no revenues from sales of our own products

in addition  during the year ended december   we generated million in contract revenues and  in licensing revenue  which included  in previously recognized up front license fees that were deferred upon the adoption of sab critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition 
we recognize sales revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales revenue from our customers is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel  and other related factors 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  unsold products in these distribution channels may be exposed to expiration 
accordingly  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could impact our results of operations  financial condition and our business 
since our inception  a portion of our revenue has been generated from license and distribution agreements for our products 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
any amounts deferred are amortized to revenue over the expected performance period of each underlying agreement 
deferred revenue represents the portion of up front license payments received that has not been earned 
milestone revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized upon completion of the milestone event or requirement if it represents the achievement of a significant step in the research  development or regulatory process
