overview tlc vision corporation tlc vision or the company provides eye surgery services in four core areas 
first  the company owns and manages premium branded refractive eye care centers throughout north america and  together with its relationships with affiliated eye care doctors  specializes in laser vision correction services to treat common refractive vision disorders such as myopia nearsightedness  hyperopia farsightedness and astigmatism 
laser vision correction surgery is an out patient procedure that is designed to change the curvature of the cornea to reduce or eliminate a patient s reliance on eyeglasses or contact lenses 
second  through the company s subsidiary  laser vision centers  inc laservision  the company provides refractive equipment access and services to independent surgeons through either fixed or mobile delivery systems 
third  the company furnishes independent surgeons with mobile access to cataract surgery equipment and services through midwest surgical services  inc finally  the company  through or partners  inc 
owns and operates ambulatory surgery centers where independent surgeons perform a variety of surgical procedures 
in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger with laservision  the company completed a business combination with laservision on may  laservision is a leading access service provider of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and other equipment and value and support services to eye surgeons 
the company believes that the combined companies can provide a broader array of services to eye care professionals to ensure these individuals may provide superior quality of care and achieve outstanding clinical results 
the company believes this will be the long term determinant of success in the eye surgery services industry 
the company serves surgeons who performed over  procedures at the company s centers or using the company s laser access during the fiscal year ended may  the company is assessing patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and developing strategies to improve laser vision correction procedure and revenue volumes 
cost reduction initiatives continue to target the effective use of funds and our growth initiative is focusing on future development opportunities for the company in the laser vision correction industry 
the company recognizes revenues at the time services are rendered 
revenues include only those revenues pertaining to owned laser centers  laser access and service fees and management fees from managing refractive and secondary care practices 
under the terms of practice management agreements  the company provides non clinical services  which include management services  staffing  equipment lease and maintenance  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
the management fees represent fair market value for the services that are furnished by the company and are typically addressed as a per procedure fee  where applicable 
for third party payor programs and corporations with arrangements with tlc vision  the company s management fee and the fee charged by the surgeon are both discounted in proportion to the discount afforded to these organizations 
while the company does not direct the manner in which the surgeons practice medicine  the company does direct the day to day non clinical operations of the centers 
the practice management agreements typically are for an extended period of time  ranging from to years 
management fees are equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
revenues of the physician s practice represent amounts charged to patients for laser vision correction services net of the impact of applicable patient discounts and related contractual adjustments 
amounts retained by physician groups may include costs for uncollectible amounts from patients  professional contractual costs and miscellaneous administrative charges 
uncollectible amounts from patients are reviewed and provided for on a regular monthly basis for those amounts due from physicians or patients for which there is a reduced likelihood of collection in whole or in part 
procedure volumes represent the number of laser vision correction procedures completed for which the amount that the patient has been invoiced for the procedure exceeds a pre defined company wide per procedure revenue threshold 
procedures may be invoiced under the threshold amounts primarily for promotional or marketing purposes and are not included in the procedure volume numbers reported 
by not counting these promotional procedures the net revenue after doctor s compensation per procedure ratio is higher than if these procedures had been included in the procedure volumes 
doctors compensation as presented in the financial statements represents the cost to the company of engaging ophthalmic professionals to perform laser vision correction services at the company s owned laser centers and fees paid to optometrists for pre and post operative care 
where the company manages laser centers the professional corporations or physicians performing the professional services at such centers engage ophthalmic professionals 
as such  the costs associated with arranging for these professionals to furnish professional services are reported as a cost of the professional corporation and not of the company 
included in costs of revenue are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties  use and maintenance of the lasers  variable expenses for consumables  financing costs and facility fees as well as center costs associated with personnel  facilities and depreciation of center assets 
in company owned centers  the company engages doctors to provide laser vision correction services and the amounts paid to the doctors are reported as a cost of revenue as well 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses which are not directly related to the provision of laser correction services 
in the fiscal year ended may   the company s procedure volume decreased by from the fiscal year in the quarter ended may   the company s procedure volume decreased sequentially from the previous quarter ended february  and decreased by quarter over quarter from the previous fiscal year s fourth quarter ended may  the company believes that the reduction in procedure volume from prior fiscal years and quarters are indicative of overall conditions in the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a number of issues  including but not limited to  a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the recent bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with the company 
in addition  being an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes may have been further depressed by economic conditions currently being experienced in north america 
despite the pricing pressures in the industry  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation defined by the company as net revenue less doctors compensation per procedure has increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was largely a result of deep discount surgery providers filing for bankruptcy thus relieving some of the price pressures that have occurred in prior fiscal years 
the company has decided to early adopt the accounting standards of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective on june   amortization of goodwill is no longer required 
however  the new standard introduces guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
upon adoption  tlc vision was required to perform a transitional impairment test on goodwill that existed as at june  the company  with the assistance of third party valuators  quantified the overall impairment in goodwill 
tlc vision had identified certain reporting units for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value at june   indicating a potential impairment of goodwill in those reporting units 
step two of the transitional impairment test  used to determine the magnitude of a goodwill impairment  was completed by may   the end of the company s fiscal year  and the resulting impairment of million was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
under the new standards  tlc vision is also required to perform additional tests of goodwill impairment at least annually  but more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
an impairment analysis was conducted by tlc vision on may  upon completion of the merger of laservision  tlc vision identified certain reporting units for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
as a result  the company recorded a charge to operating expenses of million  including million related to the impairment of goodwill resulting from the laservision acquisition and million relating to impairment of goodwill from prior acquisitions 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets included within the scope of the statement be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable 
given the significant decrease in the trading price of the company s common stock  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with its history of operating or cash flow losses  the result of an initial review was that on an undiscounted basis all the refractive practice management agreements pmas were impaired and a further fair value analysis based on the present value of future cash flows were completed to determine the extent of the impairment 
as a result of this further review  an impairment charge of million was reported and included in the operating loss for the year ended may  tlc vision made its first investment in lasersight incorporated lasersight prior to the beginning of fiscal lasersight is a company involved in the research and development of new laser technology 
from the time of purchase through the third quarter of fiscal  the market value of the investment exceeded the carrying value at each quarter end 
however  at november   the company believed that the impairment should be considered other than temporary for a number of reasons including the impairment is very substantial relative to the original purchase price  the impairment has persisted for more than nine months  sufficient time has passed to determine that the marketplace has not reacted well to fda approval of lasersight s new technology 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million 
prior to the completion of the merger  tlc vision had written down its investment in laservision  considered a portfolio investment  by million due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
the company also recorded impairment charges of million on its investment in britton vision associates and of million on other investments 
during fiscal  the company reported a reduction in the carrying value of capital assets of million reflecting a reduction of the company s lasersight lasers and two visx lasers 
these lasers do not represent the most current technology available and the company has made the decision to write the lasers down to current market value and will evaluate the best option for utilization or upgrade of these lasers 
developments in laser vision centers  inc on may   the company merged with laservision  and the results of laservision operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since that date 
laservision provides access to excimer lasers  microkeratomes  other equipment and value added support services to eye surgeons for laser vision correction and the treatment of cataracts 
the merger was effected as an all stock combination at a fixed exchange rate of of a common share of the company for each issued and outstanding share of laservision common stock  which resulted in the issuance of million common shares of the company 
in addition  the company converted existing outstanding options or warrants to acquire stock of laservision based on the exchange rate and issued options or warrants to acquire approximately million common shares of the company 
the company used the purchase method of accounting to give effect to the acquisition and combination of tlc vision and laservision 
the total purchase price of the acquisition was million consisting of o million of tlc vision shares issued to laservision shareholders  which includes tlc s ownership of laservision s common stock adjusted for the fixed exchange rate of valued at million  o million of costs incurred related to the merger which includes million in severance costs to a former laservision employee and million in costs incurred by tlc vision  o million of tlc s cash investment of laservision prior to the closing of the acquisition  and o million representing the fair value of tlc vision options to purchase common shares in exchange for all the outstanding laservision options and warrants as of the effective date of the acquisition and options issued in relation to severance 
if the merger agreement with laservision had been completed on june   the unaudited pro forma effects on the consolidated statements of loss for the fiscal years ended may  and would have been to increase revenues by million and million respectively  and to increase the net loss for the year  before and after the cumulative effect of an accounting change  by million and a decrease in the net loss of million respectfully 
as a result  the impact of the above changes to net loss  combined with the dilutive effect by the increased number of shares  the loss per share for the fiscal years ended may  and would have been reduced by and per share respectfully 
impacting the proforma results for the year ended may  are the following items a 
gain of million see note  subsequent events has been included representing amounts accrued for the settlement of a class action anti trust case involving two laser manufacturers 
b 
expenses of million relating to the pending merger with the company c 
impairment charges of i million relating to goodwill  ii million relating to deferred contract rights  and iii million relating to asset impairments 
the above unaudited pro forma information is presented for information purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations as they would have been if the merger had occurred on june   nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations which may occur in the future 
anticipated efficiencies from the combination have been excluded from the amounts included in the pro forma information 
the million relating to the activities of laservision represents a contingent asset received related to the pillar point settlement acquired by tlc vision that has been included in the purchase price allocation as at may  as an other asset 
the company is currently investigating its legal obligations with regards to the amount of this settlement that may need to be paid to the minority interests in the former laservision subsidiaries and is awaiting further information and analysis in this regard 
however  based on its current review of its obligations  management has included an accrual of 
million for its best estimate of the liability that existed at the date of the acquisition 
if the additional information with regards to the legal obligations indicates that a different amount should be paid  any adjustment will be recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation 
the merger of laservision was accounted for in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
restructuring activities during fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce employee costs consistent with current revenue levels  close certain under performing centers and eliminate duplicate functions caused by the merger with laservision 
by the end of the year  this program resulted in total cost for severance  lease commitments and office closures of million of which million has been paid out in cash and options 
the company estimates that these restructuring programs will save the company approximately million on an annual basis in future periods 
divestiture vision source in july  tlc vision acquired interest in vision source  inc vision source for share consideration 
vision source is a franchiser of private eye care practitioners 
in fiscal  the company signed a restricted stock incentive plan and related agreements which will allow the current management of vision source to be awarded up to of the common shares of vision source provided certain performance requirements are achieved by may  as of may   of the performance requirement was achieved  resulting in a charge to income of million  which was reported as cost of revenues in the other healthcare services segment 
when and if vision source management achieves the remaining performance objectives to earn the remaining of vision source common stock  additional charges to income will be recorded based upon the estimated fair value of vision source stock as earned 
pure laser hair removal and treatment clinics  inc on july   tlc vision sold its holdings of pure laser hair removal and treatment clinics  inc pure for a promissory note of 
million and of the pure s net income for operating years to as at may   the company had an agreement in principle for the sale of pure 
under fas  when management having the authority to approve an action has committed to a plan to dispose of long lived assets  the assets are to be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company has guaranteed the facilities leases for the buyer totalling million 
as management does not believe the buyer will be able to fulfill this commitment the company has reserved and charged income for million 
further  as tlc vision does not expect to recover the note receivable  management has quantified the expected loss on disposal to be approximately million and recorded an impairment in the assets for the entire amount in fiscal visx settlement in july  two excimer laser manufacturers reported settling a class action anti trust case 
in august  laservision received approximately million from its portion of the settlement  and tlc vision received million 
the million relating to the activities of laservision represents a contingent asset acquired by tlc vision that has been included in the purchase price allocation as at may  as an other asset 
the company is currently investigating its legal obligations with regards to the amount of this settlement that may need to be paid to the minority interests in the former laservision subsidiaries and is awaiting further information and analysis in this regard 
however  based on its current review of its obligations  management has included an accrual of  for its best estimate of the liability that existed at the date of the acquisition 
if the additional information with regards to the legal obligations indicates that a different amount should be paid  any adjustment will be recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation 
the million relating to the activities of tlc vision prior to the acquisition represents a contingent gain 
management is also investigating its legal obligations with regards to the amount of this settlement than may need to be paid to the minority interests or the various physicians affiliated or associated with tlc vision and is awaiting further information and analysis in this regard 
accordingly  if it is not currently able to estimate the amount  if any  to which the holders of minority interests may be entitled  the difference between the million amount and the amount to be paid to the minority interests and physicians  if any  will be recorded as a gain in fiscal critical accounting policies goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with sfas which requires the company to make significant judgements about the determination of the fair value of its reporting units in order to assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of the goodwill 
these judgements are dependent on a number of factors such as projected future cash flows  general economic and competitive conditions and appropriate discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
during the current year  the company determined that a significant impairment in the value of the goodwill had occurred and recorded both a transitional charge to earnings on adoption of sfas and a further charge to earnings during the year 
long lived assets the company accounts for its long lived assets in accordance with sfas which requires the company to periodically assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether projected undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of such assets 
this requires the company to make significant judgements about the expected future cash flows that are dependent on the general and economic conditions and are subject to change 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
during the current year  the company determined that a significant impairment in the value of its intangible assets and certain of its fixed assets had occurred and recorded a charge to earnings 
investments the company accounts for its available for sale securities in accordance with sfas which requires the company to record these investments at market value at each reporting period 
changes in market value are recorded as other comprehensive income except when declines in market value below cost are considered to be other than temporary 
the determination of whether a decline in market value is considered other than temporary involves making significant judgements considering factors such as the length of duration of the decline and factors specific to each investment 
during the year  the company determined that factors indicated that an other than temporary decline had occurred and recorded a significant charge to income

approximately of total revenues were derived from refractive services as compared to in fiscal revenues from refractive activities for fiscal were million  which is lower than the prior fiscal year s million 
approximately  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to approximately  procedures in fiscal management believes that the decrease in procedure volume and the associated reduction of revenue was indicative of the overall condition of the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the recent bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with tlc vision centers 
in addition  as an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes have been further depressed by economic conditions currently being experienced in north america 
the company maintains its stated objective of being a premium provider of laser vision correction services in an industry that has faced significant pricing pressures 
despite pricing pressures in the industry  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation per procedure  for fiscal increased by in comparison to fiscal the increase was largely a result of deep discount surgery providers filing for bankruptcy thus relieving some of the price pressures that have occurred in prior fiscal years 
revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of over in comparison to million in fiscal the increase in revenues reflected revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries  while revenues in the secondary care management  and asset management subsidiaries reflected little or moderate growth 
cost of revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of over in comparison to million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenue reflected the increase in revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries 
the cost of revenues for other healthcare services centers in fiscal included the cost of tlc visions eyevantange 
com subsidiary 
eyevantage 
com incurred a significant amount of cost without offsetting revenue  thereby resulting in cost of revenues increasing at a lesser rate than the increase in the associated revenues in fiscal net loss from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  in comparison to a net loss of for the loss for fiscal included for the impairment of goodwill and for the writedown of investments in other healthcare services 
the loss for fiscal included the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc  which generated losses of million 
net loss for fiscal does not reflect the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc due to the decision by the company in fiscal to cease material funding of this subsidiary and the resulting decision by eyevantage 
com  inc to abandon its e commerce enterprise 
the profit from other healthcare services for fiscal of million excluding the impairment and investment writedowns  reflected an increase from the loss of million for fiscal excluding eyevantage 
com  inc and restructuring costs 
the improved profitability for was due primarily to increased revenues while managing the cost structure thus increasing gross margins 
in the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal  the company entered into practice management agreements with a number of surgeons resulting in an increase in intangible assets to reflect the value assigned to these agreements 
these intangible assets are amortized over the term of the applicable agreements 
these agreements have resulted  either directly or indirectly  in lower per procedure fees being paid to the applicable surgeons and a corresponding reduction in doctors compensation to offset the increased amortization costs 
the result was an increase to the net revenue after doctors compensation per procedure ratio 
the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pre tax charge of million to record the impairment in the carrying value of certain practice management agreements on which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may  the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for fiscal was million  less than cost of refractive revenues of million in fiscal these reductions were in line with reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  reductions in royalty fees on laser usage and reduced personnel costs 
these reductions were offset by a reduction in the carrying value of capital assets of million reflecting a reduction of the company s lasersight lasers to and two visx lasers to  each 
these lasers do not represent the most current technology available and the company has made the decision to write the lasers down to current market value and will evaluate the best option for utilization or upgrade of these lasers 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include a fixed cost component for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which has resulted in cost of revenues decreasing at a lesser rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal than the decrease in the associated revenues 
cost of revenues of owned centers include the cost of doctor compensation 
cost of doctor compensation varies in relation to revenues 
accordingly  when combined with the conversion of a number of owned centers to managed centers  the cost of revenues of owned centers reflect a much larger variance in the decrease in the costs of revenues in comparison to managed centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased marketing costs  decreased infrastructure costs and reductions associated with corporate advantage and third party payer programs  each identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
interest income expense reflects interest revenue from the company s net cash and cash equivalent position 
interest revenue has been consistently decreasing throughout the year as a result of the company s declining cash position and a decrease on the interest yields throughout the year 
this decrease also includes an increase in interest expense resulting from additional long term debt and as a result of the sale leaseback transaction of the corporate international headquarters in canada in the second quarter depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  primarily as the result of the company s early adoption of sfas no 
 thus eliminating the requirement for the goodwill amortization 
the adoption of this statement resulted in decreased amortization expense of approximately million for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense has also decreased due to fewer capital additions resulting from limited development of new centers and the closure of certain existing centers 
the company s adoption of sfas resulted in a transitional impairment loss of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter 
in addition  the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may   including million related to the impairment of goodwill from the acquisition of laservision and million for the impairment of goodwill from prior acquisitions 
intangible assets whose useful lives are not indefinite are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement to a maximum of years 
current amortization periods range from to years 
in establishing these long term contractual relationships with the company  key surgeons in many cases have agreed to receive reduced fees for laser vision correction procedures performed 
the reduction in doctors compensation offsets in part the increased amortization of the intangible practice management agreements 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets included within the scope of the statement be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable that is  information indicates that an impairment might exist 
given the significant decrease in the trading price of the company s common stock  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with its history of operating or cash flow losses  the company identified certain practice management agreements where the recoverability was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in tlc vision made its first investment in lasersight incorporated lasersight prior to the beginning of fiscal lasersight is a company involved in the research and development of new laser technology 
from the time of purchase through the third quarter of fiscal  the market value of the investment exceeded the carrying value at each quarter end 
however  by november   the company believed that the impairment should be considered other than temporary for a number of reasons including the impairment is very substantial relative to the original purchase price  the impairment has persisted for more than nine months  sufficient time has passed to determine that the market place has not reacted well to fda approval of lasersight s new technology 
as a result  the company recorded a total impairment charge of million during fiscal with respect to its investment in laservision tlc vision wrote down its investment in laservision by million in the period prior to the merger  due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
finally  the company has recorded impairment charges of million on its investment in britton vision associates and of million on other investments 
during fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce employee costs in line with current revenue levels  close certain under performing centers and eliminating duplicate functions caused by the merger with laservision 
by the end of the year  this program resulted in total cost for severance and office closures of million of which million has been paid out in cash and options 
all restructuring costs will be financed through the company s cash and cash equivalents 
these restructuring programs will save the company approximately million on an annual basis in future periods 
a the company continued its objective of reducing employee costs in line with revenues 
this activity occurred in two stages with total charges of million 
the first stage of reductions were identified in the second and third quarters of fiscal and resulted in restructuring charges of million all of which had been paid out in cash or options by the end of the fiscal year 
this reduction impacted employees of whom were working in laser centers with the remaining working within various corporate functions 
the second stage of the cost reduction required the company to identify the impact of its acquisition of laservision on may  and eliminate surplus positions resulting from the acquisition 
these costs will be paid out by the end of the second quarter of fiscal b as part of the company restructuring subsequent to its acquisition of laservision in may  six centers were identified for closure such centers were identified based on managements earning criteria  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these closures resulted in restructuring charges of million reflecting a write down of fixed assets of million and cash costs of million which include net lease commitments net of costs to sublet and sub lease income of million  ongoing laser commitments of million  termination costs of a doctor s contract of million and severance costs impacting center employees of million 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
c the company also identified four centers where management determined that given the current and future expected procedures  the centers had excess leased capacity or the lease arrangements were not economical 
the company assessed these four centers to determine whether the excess space should be subleased or whether the centres should be relocated 
the company provided million related to the costs associated with sub leasing the excess or unoccupied facilities 
a total of million of this provision related to non cash costs of writing down fixed assets and million represented net future cash costs for lease commitments and costs to sublet available space offset by sub lease income that is projected to be generated 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease

closure of centers and relocation downsize of centers occurred effectively at the end of the year and numbers represent the impact that these activities would have on fiscal results had they occurred at the beginning of the year 
in august of the company continued its objective of reducing employee costs in line with revenues with total charges of million  which will be reflected in the first quarter earnings 
this reduction impacted employees of the corporate management and staff 
these restructuring programs are expected to save the company approximately million on an annual basis going forward 
the company is currently reviewing its space requirements with regards to its international headquarters 
no restructuring charge has been made relating to this facility as no decision has been made with regards to the use or disposal of this facility and the company continues to use this facility for certain functions 
any costs associated with exiting or renegotiating the lease on this facility  which could be material  will be reflected in income in future periods 
income tax expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease reflects the company s losses incurred in fiscal offset by the impact of the tax liabilities associated with the company s investments in profitable subsidiaries that are less than owned and the requirement to reflect minimum tax liabilities relevant in canada  united states and certain other jurisdictions 
as of may   the company has non capital losses available for carryforward for income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to reduce taxable income of future years 
the canadian losses can only be utilized by the source company whereas the united states losses are utilized on a united states consolidated basis 
the canadian losses of million expire as follows year ended may  the united states losses of million expire between and the canadian and united states losses include amounts of million and million respectively relating to the acquisitions of and beaconeye  the availability and timing of utilization of which may be restricted 
the loss for fiscal was  million or per share  compared to a loss of million or per share for fiscal this increased loss primarily reflected the impact of reduced refractive revenues  the reduction in carrying values of capital and intangible assets  the reduction in the carrying value of goodwill and the write down of investments offset partially by reduced costs and decreased depreciation and amortization 
the company has undertaken initiatives intended to address patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and expectations to improve laser vision correction procedure and revenue volumes 
cost initiatives are targeting effective use of funds and a growth initiative is focusing on the future development opportunities for the company in the laser vision eye care service industry 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  revenues for fiscal were million  which was a decrease over fiscal of million 
approximately of total revenues were derived from refractive services as compared to in fiscal revenues from eye care centers for fiscal were million  which was lower than fiscal of million 
approximately  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to  procedures in fiscal the decrease in procedure volume and the associated reduction of revenue reflects the condition of the laser vision correction industry  which had experienced uncertainty due to a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies and the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavourable outcomes from procedures performed at competing centers 
due to the pricing pressures in the industry and the lower procedure prices offered pursuant to discounts associated with the company s corporate advantage program  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation  per procedure  for fiscal declined by in comparison to fiscal in the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal  the company completed practice management agreements with a number of surgeons resulting in an increase in intangible assets to reflect the value assigned to these agreements 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the term of the applicable agreements 
these agreements have resulted  either directly or indirectly  in lower per procedure fees being paid to the applicable surgeons and a corresponding reduction in doctors compensation to offset the increased amortization costs 
the result was an increase to the net revenue after doctors compensation per procedure ratio 
the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for fiscal was million  which was lower than fiscal of million 
this reduction was primarily due to reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  lower royalty fees on laser usage and lower personnel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this reflected increased marketing costs aimed at raising consumer awareness of tlc vision s brand 
in addition  the increased expense was due to increased consulting costs  legal costs and infrastructure costs incurred to support our growth strategy 
these costs were partially offset by reductions associated with corporate advantage and third party payer programs identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives
