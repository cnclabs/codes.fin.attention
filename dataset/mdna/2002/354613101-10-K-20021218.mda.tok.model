item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
we also make some statements relating to the future which are called forward looking statements 
although we do our best to make clear and accurate forward looking statements  the actual results and outcomes could differ significantly from those that we discuss in this document 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on these forward looking statements and should review the risk factors section  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general we derive the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional  high net worth and private accounts  and other investment products 
this is our main business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public globally via five distinct names franklin templeton mutual series fiduciary trust bissett our sponsored investment products include a broad range of domestic and global international equity  hybrid  fixed income and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals  foundations and institutions and consumer lending 
at september   we employed approximately  people in countries serving customers on six different continents 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years 
in millions except per share amounts vs vs net income earnings per common share basic diluted operating margin ebitda margin ebitda margin is earnings before interest  taxes on income  depreciation and the amortization of intangibles divided by total revenues 
the effect of the september million other than temporary decline in investments value is excluded from ebitda 
our september ebitda margin  including other than temporary decline in investments value  is 
net income decreased by and diluted earnings per share decreased by in fiscal mainly due to lower investment and other income related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments and increased operating expenses  partially offset by higher revenues 
net income decreased by and diluted earnings per share decreased by in fiscal  mainly due to increased operating expenses offset by slightly higher revenue and investment income 
assets under management in billions as of september  vs vs equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid fixed income tax free taxable domestic us global international total fixed income money total simple monthly average for the year investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  are calculated using daily average assets under management 
our assets under management at september  were billion  higher than a year ago 
the simple monthly average value of these assets during fiscal was billion as compared to billion in fiscal  an increase 
the year over year change in simple monthly average assets under management generally is more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in year end assets 
the mix of assets under management is shown below  followed by industry data showing average effective investment management fees using data from lipper r inc our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates 
as of september  percentage of total assets under management equity fixed income hybrid money total equity hybrid fixed income money taxable taxable global domestic tax domestic global international us free us international industry effective investment management fee rates as of september  calculated by franklin templeton investments based on asset weighted averages of management fee rates provided by lipper r inc industry effective investment management fee rates are calculated using all us based  open ended funds that reported expense data to lipper r inc as of the funds most recent annual report date  and for which management fee rates were greater or equal to zero 
industry effective fee rates reflect the investment management expenses of retail and institutional funds drawn from all distribution channels  without exception 
the averages reflect combined retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes  and all distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuities are not included 
the change in the mix of assets under management was largely due to the inclusion of the assets under management of fiduciary trust company international fiduciary beginning in fiscal and the market depreciation in equity assets in and approximately of fiduciary s assets under management were classified as hybrid assets at the time of acquisition in april this change in mix lowered our overall effective fee rate on assets managed  as a greater percentage of assets under management are in the fixed income and hybrid categories which generally carry a lower management fee than equity assets 
the effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management declined to for the fiscal year compared to in fiscal and in fiscal at september  assets under management by shareholder location were as follows united asia pacific in billions states canada europe and other total assets under management investors in the united states own approximately of our assets under management and approximately of our revenues originate in the united states 
investment advisory and administrative services related to these assets may be provided in jurisdictions outside the united states in accordance with contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products 
the components of the change in our assets under management were as follows in billions year ended september  vs vs beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions acquisitions  depreciation appreciation n a ending assets under management during fiscal and  our sponsored investment products experienced overall net cash inflows  including reinvested dividends  in contrast to the net cash outflows experienced in fiscal gross product sales increased while redemptions decreased in our acquisition of pioneer iti amc limited pioneer  an indian investment management company  in july increased our assets under management by billion as of the date of this acquisition 
in  the acquisition of bissett in october increased our assets under management by billion  and the fiduciary acquisition in april increased our assets under management by billion  as of the dates of those acquisitions 
despite an overall decline in domestic and global equity markets in the latter half of  our assets under management increased from fiscal primarily as a result of strong net sales during the year and less depreciation than in in fiscal  assets under management increased mainly due to the fiduciary and bissett acquisitions and net inflows  partially offset by depreciation 
operating revenues the table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues summary in fiscal  total operating revenues increased over the prior year 
investment management and underwriting and distribution fees increased due to both higher net sales and higher average assets under management 
we also benefited from the inclusion of fiduciary revenues for a full fiscal year in  as well as higher net gains related to auto loan securitizations included in other  net revenue 
in fiscal  total operating revenues increased 
the acquisition of fiduciary in april provided higher investment management fees from higher average assets under management 
we also experienced higher banking revenues included in other  net offset by reduced shareholder servicing fees 
investment management fees investment management fees  accounting for of our operating revenues in fiscal  include both investment advisory and administration fees 
these fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 
in return for these fees  we provide a combination of investment advisory  administrative and other management services 
investment management fees increased in fiscal mainly due to increased net sales  which increased assets under management  and the impact of including fiduciary for a full fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a shift in our asset mix toward fixed income investment products  which led to a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate 
investment management fees increased in fiscal from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the fiduciary acquisition  which increased the simple monthly average assets under management in the latter half of the year  partially offset by a shift in our asset mix toward fixed income and hybrid investment products  which carry lower effective fee rates 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales at reduced or zero commissions are offered on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes 
our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
while other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions  in the united states  distribution fees include b fees 
these fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisors and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal underwriting fees increased consistent with a increase in gross product sales and distribution fees increased consistent with an increase in simple monthly average assets under management 
underwriting and distribution fees remained constant in fiscal as an overall increase in product sales was offset by a greater percentage of overall sales being made at no or lower commission levels 
distribution fees also remained constant as the increase in average assets under management was related to the fiduciary acquisition 
the fiduciary assets under management are not subject to distribution fees  therefore  these assets did not affect distribution fee income as would be expected with a year over year increase in average assets under management 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management 
we receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the previous calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
shareholder servicing fees decreased in fiscal and in fiscal consistent with a decrease in the quarterly average number of billable accounts 
our acquisition of pioneer added approximately million shareholder accounts 
other  net other  net consists mainly of revenues from the banking finance operating segment and fiduciary s custody services 
revenues from the banking finance operating segment include interest income on loans  servicing income  and investment income on banking finance investment securities  which are offset by interest expense and the provision for anticipated loan losses 
other  net increased in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the inclusion of fiduciary s banking and custody activities for a full fiscal year in and increased gains recognized on auto loan portfolio sales 
other  net increased in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of the fiduciary banking and custody activities from the date of acquisition of fiduciary to those of franklin bank and trust  fsb  and franklin capital corporation 
operating expenses as a percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets other september  expense  net n a total operating expenses summary operating expenses increased during fiscal this increase was mainly due to increased underwriting and distribution fees consistent with higher underwriting and distribution revenue  and higher compensation and benefits and technology and occupancy costs primarily due to the inclusion of fiduciary s activity for a full fiscal year in the increase in these expense categories was offset in part by a decline in amortization of intangible assets on discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in fiscal  operating expenses increased mainly caused by increased compensation and benefits  information systems  technology and occupancy costs  the addition of the operating costs of fiduciary  increased underwriting and distribution expenses and increased amortization of intangible assets 
underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling  distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased during fiscal due mainly to the inclusion of fiduciary s activity for a full fiscal year  including retention bonuses committed to the fiduciary staff 
this increase was partially offset by an overall decline in employees as well as the decision made by management during the quarter ended december to reduce employee salaries by or  depending on specific salary categories 
in may  we reinstated salaries for employees whose salaries were reduced by and  in july  we reinstated employee salaries in the reduction category 
we employed approximately  people at september  compared to approximately  at the same time last year 
our acquisition of pioneer added approximately employees 
in order to hire and retain our key employees  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues 
compensation and benefits increased during fiscal this increase was mainly due to the addition of approximately fiduciary employees from the date of acquisition  retention bonuses for fiduciary employees  annual salary increases  and an increase in employee benefit and recruiting costs 
information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the inclusion of costs related to the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations and added technology and occupancy costs of the fiduciary acquisition for a full fiscal year in information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase was primarily due to continued expenditure on new technology initiatives  an investment in the technology infrastructure of the company  the charges and costs in connection with the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations  and the added technology and occupancy costs of the fiduciary acquisition 
we also experienced an increase in occupancy costs related to our expansion in asia  canada  and europe as well as costs related to the relocation to our new worldwide headquarters in san mateo  california 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs were as follows in thousands net carrying amount at beginning of period    additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments    net assets purchased through acquisitions  amortization during period    net carrying amount at end of period    information systems and technology costs capitalized in fiscal were less than amounts capitalized in fiscal as we slowed down a number of initiatives  realized synergies from previous investments in technology and delayed the start of other technology projects given the current economic slowdown and our focus on cost control and management 
advertising and promotion advertising and promotion increased during fiscal and in fiscal increases in both years resulted mainly from increased promotion and advertising activity to educate the sales channels and the investing public about the strong relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes  including class b  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  while at the same time  our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
in the united states  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met while our us distribution subsidiary pays a commission on such sales 
class c shares are sold with a front end sales charge that is lower than the commission paid by the us distributor 
we defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries 
we have arranged to finance certain of these deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lightning finance company limited lfl  a company in which we have an ownership interest 
in the united states  lfl has entered into a financing agreement with our us distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by lfl 
as a result  we retain dca sold to lfl under the us agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an year period until resold by lfl in a securitization  which generally occurs at least once annually 
lfl sold approximately million us dca in fiscal and approximately million us dca in fiscal in securitization transactions 
in contrast to the us arrangement  lfl has entered into direct agreements with the canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources in our financial statements 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal and in fiscal these changes were mainly a result of changes in sales mix and our current financing arrangements 
as the balance of dca on our balance sheet changes  so does the amortization expense 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal this decrease was due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on october  under the new accounting standard  we ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
this resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
we completed our impairment testing as specified in sfas in march and we determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded in our financial statements as of october  amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal  due to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the purchase of bissett and fiduciary 
other income expense other income expense includes investment and other income and interest expense 
investment and other income is comprised primarily of the following dividends from investments interest income from investments in bonds and government securities realized gains and losses on investments foreign currency exchange gains and losses miscellaneous income  including gain or loss on disposal of property 
other income expense was a net expense in fiscal mainly due to a million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in contrast  in fiscal  we recognized net realized gains of approximately million on the sale of certain sponsored investment products held for investment purposes and other realized gains of million related to the sale of our former headquarters building in san mateo 
other income expense increased in fiscal from the prior year  primarily due to net realized gains related to our sponsored investment products and the sale of our former headquarters building in san mateo 
taxes on income our effective income tax rate for fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal and as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of income primarily investment management fees subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing us federal and state tax rates 
the effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  cash and cash equivalents include cash  us treasury bills and other debt instruments with original maturities of three month or less and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash  including money market funds 
the mix of short term instruments and  in particular  the maturity schedules of some debt instruments  affect the level reported in cash and cash equivalents and in investments  available for sale in any given year 
liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables increased to  million at september  from  million at september  at september   approximately million was available to us under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs 
in addition  in fiscal we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission permitting the issuance of debt and equity securities of up to million 
our committed revolving credit facilities at september  totaled million  of which  million was under a day facility 
the remaining million facility is under a five year facility and will expire in june in addition  our fiduciary subsidiary has million available in uncommitted bank lines under the federal reserve funds system 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the equity market valuation levels 
in extreme circumstances  we might not be able to access this liquidity readily 
outstanding debt increased to million at september  compared to million at september  as of september  outstanding debt consists of million in principal and accrued interest related to outstanding convertible notes that we issued in may and million of other long term debt 
as of september   outstanding debt included million related to the convertible notes and million of other long term debt 
each of the  principal amount at maturity convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock 
we may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after may  at their accreted value 
we may have to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value  at the option of the holders  on may of      and in this event  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock 
the amount of convertible notes that will be redeemed depends on  among other factors  the performance of our common stock 
other long term debt consists primarily of deferred commission liability recognized in relation to the us dca financed by lfl that has not yet been sold by lfl in a securitization transaction 
the increase in outstanding debt in fiscal is due to additional financing activity of our mutual fund class b shares sales and the accretion of the convertible notes to maturity  partially offset by an increase in dca sold by lfl 
we have arranged with lfl for non recourse financing of sales commissions advanced on sales of our b and c shares globally 
the sales commissions that we have financed through lfl during fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal since september  our banking finance operating segment has entered into a number of auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
the outstanding loan balances held by these special purpose entities were million as of september  and million as of september  our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future 
we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business make strategic acquisitions acquire shares of our common stock fund property and equipment purchases pay operating expenses of the business enhance our technology infrastructure improve our business processes pay shareholder dividends repay and service debt 
we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through the following our existing liquid assets the continuing cash flow from operations our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities our ability to issue debt or equity securities our mutual fund sales commission financing arrangement 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  or through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described in note to the financial statements  our largest commitment at september  relates to our convertible debt outstanding 
in addition  at september   the banking finance operating segment had commitments to extend credit aggregating million  mainly under its credit card lines 
standby letters of credit issued to fiduciary clients totaled million and expire through december the standby letters of credit are secured by marketable securities

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  please refer to note to the financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material impact on our financial statements 
intangible assets at september  our assets included intangible assets as follows in thousands net carrying amount goodwill  intangible assets definite lived  intangible assets indefinite lived  total  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment at least once a year 
as of march   we completed the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded in our books and records as of october  while we believe that our testing was appropriate  it involved the use of estimates and assumptions 
using different assumptions may have resulted in recognizing some impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in our financial statements 
we are also required to consider if any impairment has occurred to definite lived intangible assets 
based on our review and evaluation  we do not believe any impairment has occurred 
income taxes as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states 
we have made no provision for us taxes on  million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
during fiscal  we recognized million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for any losses that may arise from these matters 
special purpose entities special purpose entities spes consist of corporations  trusts  partnerships and other entities that are established for a limited purpose 
in the united states  the financial accounting standards board fasb has currently undertaken a project to address accounting for spes 
we will continue to monitor the fasb s project to determine the effect  if any  it will have on our treatment of any of the spes described below 
lightning finance company limited 
we finance certain dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lfl  a company in which we have an ownership interest 
in the united states  lfl has entered into a financing agreement with our us distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by lfl 
as a result  we retain dca sold under the us agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an year period  until resold by lfl in a securitization 
in contrast to the us arrangement  lfl has entered into direct agreements with the canadian and european sponsored investment products  and we do not record dca from these sources in our financial statements 
auto loan securitization trusts 
we have entered into auto loan securitization transactions with a number of qualified spes and have recorded these transactions as sales 
in addition  we retained interest only strips receivable  representing our contractual right to receive interest and other cash flows from the pool of securitized loans after payment of required amounts to the holders of the securities and certain costs associated with the securitization 
interest only strips are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
lessor trust 
we lease our corporate headquarters in san mateo  california from a lessor trust under an operating lease that expires in fiscal  with additional renewal options for a further period of up to years 
in connection with this lease  we are contingently liable for approximately million in residual guarantees  representing approximately of the total construction costs of million 
the lease agreement is not expected to impact our cash flows or financial condition materially during the initial five year lease period 
the lease is treated as an operating lease  as none of the capitalization criteria under statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for leases  were met at the inception of the lease 
collateralized debt obligations 
we provide investment management services to  and have made investments in  a number of collateralized debt obligation cdo spes 
these cdos were established as a vehicle for our clients and invest mainly in debt instruments 
our ownership interest in the cdos is not sufficient to meet consolidation requirements and they are reported at fair value as further described in note to the financial statements

risk factors forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  words or phrases about the future such as expected to  will continue  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of statements about our future cash needs  our anticipated uses of cash  the expected sources of future cash inflows  and the anticipated costs related to the september  tragedy  are also forward looking statements 
these types of statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  such as the factors described in the risk factors outlined below 
these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  and you should not rely on them 
rather  you should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk disclosures in this annual report 
if a circumstance occurs that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate  we have no obligation to announce publicly the change in our expectations  or to revise the forward looking statements 
we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with numerous investment management companies  stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
additionally  competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products  which could limit the distribution of our investment products 
to the extent that existing or potential customers  including securities dealers  decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors  the sales of our products as well as our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisors 
increasing competition for these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one of the major financial advisors who distribute our products were to cease their operations  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products  which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global equity markets 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism and the recent reports of accounting irregularities at certain public companies 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our revenue and income 
the levels of our assets under management  which in turn impact revenues  are subject to significant fluctuations 
global economic conditions  changes in the equity market place  interest rates  inflation rates  the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values and levels of our assets under management 
changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income  since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage 
similarly  our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation 
we face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets 
our ability to successfully integrate the widely varied segments of our business can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations 
our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business globally depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting  financial and operational systems of our international business with that of our domestic business 
our inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for class b and c shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans 
we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified employees  our overall business condition and revenues could suffer 
our emerging market portfolios and related revenues are vulnerable to market specific political and economic risks 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business 
economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase 
the september  world trade center tragedy may adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition of fiduciary 
the september  tragedy at the world trade center resulted in the destruction of our fiduciary headquarters  loss of of our employees  additional operating expenses to re establish and relocate our operations  and asset write offs  all of which could adversely affect or delay our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition 
our insurance coverage may not cover all losses on claims for property  damage  extra expenses and business interruptions arising out of the destruction of the world trade center 
for the next several years  insurance costs are likely to increase materially and we may not be able to obtain the same types or amounts of coverage 
the fiduciary acquisition could adversely affect our combined financial results or the market price of our common stock 
if the benefits of the acquisition over time do not exceed the costs associated with the acquisition  including any dilution to our shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
revenue and cost synergies from the acquisition of fiduciary may not be fully realized and may take longer to realize than originally anticipated 
we are subject to federal reserve board regulation 
upon completion of our acquisition of fiduciary  we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board 
we are subject to the restrictions  limitations  or prohibitions of the bank holding company act of and the gramm leach bliley act 
the federal reserve board may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities  including if the federal reserve board believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition 
the federal reserve board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law 
technology and operating risk could constrain our operations 
we are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology  operating systems and premises 
although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war  and third party failures  which could negatively impact our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign exchange and or equity prices 
management is responsible for managing this risk 
our risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates mainly through our debt transactions and portfolio debt holdings available for sale  which are carried at fair value in our financial statements 
as of september   a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates 
in our banking finance operating segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources 
in addition  we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance operating segment  our outstanding debt and portfolio debt holdings  individually and collectively  of a basis point movement in market interest rates 
we do not expect this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario 
we are also exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio 
we operate mainly in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses  however  are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states
