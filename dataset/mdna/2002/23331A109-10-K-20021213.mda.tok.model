item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies general a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton  inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september  and  and for the years ended september   and each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles gaap for public companies operating in the united states of america 
in instances where alternative methods of accounting for a given economic phenomenon are permissible under gaap  we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business  the results of our operations and our financial condition  and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements 
the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton  inc and all of its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
except for insignificant amounts remaining from our venture capital investments of fiscal and  and a few inconsequential joint ventures we inherited with the schuler acquisition  we owned no minority interests in unconsolidated entities at september  based upon currently available information  we believe that none of them will qualify for consolidation in our financial statements under the financial accounting standards board s fasb proposed new accounting rules on consolidations 
segment information our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services 
our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in states and markets throughout the united states 
the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets 
we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 
revenue recognition we recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer 
virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash 
when we execute a sales contract with our home buyers  or when we require advance payment from home buyers for custom changes  upgrades  or options related to their homes  we record the cash deposits as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled 
we either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts  depending upon the provisions of the contracts 
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we earn mortgage loan origination fees when we close and fund the loans associated with the homes financed 
we defer the earned origination fees  net of direct origination costs  and recognize them as revenues  along with the associated gains or losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors 
all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction 
we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and home construction  inventory costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction 
applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete are charged to selling  general and administrative sg a expense as incurred 
all indirect overhead costs  such as construction superintendents compensation  advertising and builder s risk insurance are either charged to sg a expense as incurred or  in the case of builder s risk insurance  amortized to sg a expense over the applicable policy periods 
we amortize to cost of sales for homes closed all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project 
any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project 
when a home is closed  we usually have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we will ultimately pay related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs needed to complete each closed home 
we monitor the accuracy of each month s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
each quarter  we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable 
if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 
guidelines  we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter 
to date  such impairment losses have occurred primarily in markets that we have chosen to abandon  and have been insignificant in the aggregate 
fair value estimation under sfas no 
involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and  due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates 
warranty costs warranty reserves have been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods 
the one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor  the ten year period is for major construction defects 
we have  and require all of our subcontractors to have  general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction product defects  but accrue the warranty costs liability to cover our self insured retentions and deductible amounts under those policies 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
interest rate swaps we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london inter bank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages on a total notional amount of million 
we entered into both of the ten year swap contracts in because we were unwilling to buy out the bank s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds  we chose not to designate the swaps as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 which we adopted on october  as a result  even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility  we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter 
at the end of each quarter  the swaps market value will have changed depending upon the market s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity in the swaps market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates 
the declines in short term interest rates in the past two years have resulted in a decline in the swaps market value to a liability of approximately million at september  we cannot predict the changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps 
any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal under its provisions  we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings 
such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption excess of cost over net assets acquired and  in our homebuilding segment  totaled million at september  sfas no 
requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded 
we performed such assessments as of october  and september   and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 
require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs and due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates 
stock based compensation with the approval of the board of directors  we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock 
our board of directors approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders 
we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant 
the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period 
we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for the grants at the time of issuance 
sfas no 
requires us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense for the estimated value of the options when granted and the changes in their values over their terms 
the sfas no 
requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date 
if we had used the black scholes formula for valuing option grants made after our adoption of sfas no 
 our net income would have been million  million and million less than reported amounts for fiscal  and  respectively  and diluted net income per share would have been less than the reported amounts for each of those years 
for the present  we have chosen to continue our current method of accounting for stock options until the fasb and or the securities and exchange commission sec have formalized and revised requirements for accounting for them in the future 
when they do  we will promptly adopt whatever new accounting methods are required 
results of operations consolidated we provide homebuilding services in states and markets through our homebuilding divisions 
through our financial services operations  we also provide mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  consolidated revenues increased  to  million in from  million in  primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues 
the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to  million in revenues generated by fortress florida  acquired in may  emerald builders  acquired in july  and schuler homes  inc  acquired in february  during the periods in that were less than one year after each was acquired 
income before income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  income before income taxes increased percentage points  to  from in factors contributing to that improvement were reductions in homebuilding other expense  a percentage point improvement in homebuilding sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues  a significantly improved operating margin in our financial services segment  all offset in part by a percentage point decline in our homebuilding gross margins 
the decline in the homebuilding gross margin was due primarily to sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition 
if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler s historical cost  rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies  reported homebuilding gross profit would have been greater by approximately million of homebuilding revenues 
the consolidated provision for income taxes increased to million in  from million in  due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate of remained the same in both periods 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  consolidated revenues increased  to  million in from  million in  primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues 
the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to million in revenues generated by fortress florida  acquired in may  and emerald builders  acquired in july income before income taxes increased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  income before income taxes increased percentage points  to  from in  primarily due to the increase in gross profit percentage achieved by the homebuilding segment  which was offset in part by write downs to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies and the decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements during the year 
the consolidated provision for income taxes increased  to million in  from million in  due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate decreased percentage points  to in  from in  primarily due to changes in the overall effective state income tax rate

in the past  our backlog has been a reliable indicator of future closings 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from home sales increased  to  million  homes closed in from  million  homes closed in revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions  with percentage increases ranging from in the mid atlantic region to in the west region 
the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets  an increase in the average selling price of homes closed  and the increases attributable to the acquisition of fortress florida in may  emerald builders in july  and schuler homes  inc in february in markets where we operated throughout both twelve month periods  home sales revenues increased by  to  million  homes closed in from  million  homes closed in the average selling price of homes we closed during was  up from  in the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price  of the  homes closed by the former schuler divisions  which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices 
excluding schuler closings  the average selling price of homes we closed was  up from the value of new net sales contracts increased  to  million  homes in from  million  homes in the value of new net sales contracts increased in four of our five market regions  with percentage increases ranging from in the southeast to in the west 
the value of new net sales contracts declined in the midwest 
although our two primary markets in the midwest chicago and minneapolis st 
paul remain strong  we ceased operations in cincinnati  louisville and st 
louis in  which contributed to the slight decline in new net sales contracts in that region 
the overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets  as well as sales achieved by fortress florida  emerald builders and schuler homes 
in markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years  the value of new net sales contracts increased  to  million  and the number of new net sales contracts increased  to  homes 
the average price of a new net sales contract in was  up over the  average in the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price  of the  homes sold by the former schuler divisions  which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices 
excluding the schuler sales  our average selling price of homes sold in was  up from at september   our backlog of sales contracts was  million  homes  up from  million  homes at september  in markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years  our backlog of sales contracts increased  to   homes 
the average sales price of homes in backlog was  at september   up from the  average at september  as with the average selling prices of homes closed and sold  the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to the effect of homes in the backlogs of the former schuler divisions  which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices 
excluding the schuler amounts  the average price of homes in our backlog was  up from cost of sales increased by  to  million in from  million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues 
cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased percentage points  to in  from in the benefits we achieved in from our continuing ability to raise prices in selected markets and reduce costs through our national purchasing program were offset by sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition 
if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler s historical cost  rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies  reported gross profit from home sales would have been greater by approximately million of home sales revenues 
all of the significant purchase accounting adjustments associated with the schuler acquisition were recorded in for essentially the same reasons as mentioned  total homebuilding cost of sales was of total homebuilding revenue  up percentage points from in we do not expect future cost of sales to be materially affected by charges associated with the schuler merger 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses from homebuilding activities increased by  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to in from in the percentage point decline in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased leverage of fixed sg a expenses achieved by the increases in homebuilding revenues 
interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of homebuilding revenues  homebuilding interest expense decreased to in from in due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in  our total interest costs as a percentage of average interest bearing debt declined 
also  throughout  inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interest bearing debt 
therefore  a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in we follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development 
during both years  we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory 
capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time homes are closed 
other expense associated with homebuilding activities was million in  as compared to million in the expense in is primarily due to a million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and a million write down to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies

inventories including finished homes  construction in progress  and developed residential lots and other land at september   had increased by  million from september   due to a general increase in business activity  the acquisition of schuler homes  inc and the expansion of operations in our market areas 
the inventory increase was financed largely by issuing senior notes and by retaining earnings 
our revolving credit facility had no amounts outstanding at september  and our ratio of homebuilding notes payable net of cash to total capital at september  improved percentage points  to from at september  the stockholders equity to total assets ratio increased percentage points  to at september   from at september  we refinanced our existing unsecured revolving credit facility in fiscal with a new  replacement facility 
the new million facility includes million which may be used for letters of credit 
the new facility matures in january  and is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment 
at september   we had outstanding homebuilding debt of  million 
under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit facility  our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under it is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility  million at september   or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement 
under the borrowing base limitation  the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our inventory 
at september   the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to  million 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants  limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility 
we have entered into multi year interest rate swap agreements  aggregating a notional amount of million  that have the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate revolving credit facility at 
on february   schuler homes  inc merged with and into dr horton  inc  with dr horton the surviving corporation 
at the time of the merger  schuler s assets amounted to  million  mostly inventory 
the total merger consideration consisted of the issuance of  shares of dr horton  inc common stock  valued at per share the average closing price of dr horton common stock for a period of ten trading days from december  to december   the payment of million in cash  the assumption of million of schuler s debt  million of which was paid at closing  the assumption of trade payables and other liabilities amounting to million  and the assumption of million of obligations to the schuler entities minority interest holders 
also  dr horton issued options to purchase approximately  shares of dr horton common stock to schuler employees to replace outstanding schuler stock options 
the fair value of the options issued was million and was recorded as additional capital 
the fair value of the unvested options issued was million and was recorded as unearned compensation 
the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the stock options 
the fair value of the options was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the schuler merger was accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  schuler s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangibles  were initially recorded at their fair values as of the date of the merger 
the excess of the total consideration paid over the net assets fair value approximately million was recorded as an addition to goodwill 
on april   we issued million of senior notes due the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility 
these notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment 
on february   we assumed the outstanding debt of schuler homes  inc as part of schuler s merger with us 
the debt assumed included senior notes due  senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due  all of which we recorded at their respective market values as of february  as required by their indentures in the event of a change of control  we offered to redeem all of the schuler notes at of their par amount  plus accrued interest 
in connection with that offer  we redeemed million in principal amount of the schuler senior and senior subordinated notes 
we examine the carrying value of our excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill annually to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
our consolidated goodwill amounted to million homebuilding and million financial services at september  we performed the required tests at october  and september  and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments existed 
at september   the financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of million and loan commitments for million at fixed rates 
we hedge the interest rate market risk on these mortgage loans held for sale and loan commitments through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  forward sales of mortgage backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments 
we record gains or losses related to such hedging instruments in other income as their market value changes 
such gains and losses have not significantly affected our financial services results of operations 
as of september   the financial services segment had a million  one year mortgage warehouse bank facility that matures on august   and is secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale 
the mortgage warehouse facility is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt 
at september   million had been drawn under the mortgage warehouse facility 
our wholly owned mortgage company completed a new million mortgage backed commercial paper conduit facility cp conduit facility in july the facility was increased to million in august although the agreement governing the cp conduit facility expires on july   maintenance of the facility beyond the first and subsequent anniversary date s must be annually approved by the sponsoring bank 
the cp conduit facility is also secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt 
as of september   million had been drawn under the new facility 
the mortgage loans pledged to secure the new facility are used as collateral for mortgage backed securities sold by the sponsoring bank in the secondary commercial paper markets at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to the mortgage warehouse facility 
all mortgage company activities are financed under the mortgage warehouse and cp conduit facilities 
both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance 
subsequent to september   the mortgage warehouse facility was reduced to million and the cp conduit facility was increased to million 
our historical strategy of internal growth and growth by acquisitions has required significant amounts of cash 
if we are to achieve our future growth targets  we expect that those cash requirements will continue 
we anticipate that future home construction  lot and land purchases and any acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds  existing and future credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities 
at september   under currently effective shelf registration statements  we had approximately million shares of common stock issuable to effect  in whole or in part  possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to billion 
on december   we used the billion shelf registration statement to issue million senior notes due  leaving the unused shelf registration statement amount at million 
the million net proceeds of the december senior note offering were used to pay down amounts borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility 
on may   the holders of our zero coupon convertible senior notes due will have an opportunity to require us to purchase their notes for cash at their accreted value of per note on that date 
if all of the note holders elect to require us to purchase all of their notes  we will be required to purchase notes having a total accreted value of million on that date 
in the future  we intend to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets 
we believe that our current cash position  our cash generation capabilities  the amounts available under our revolving line of credit agreements and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner with our existing shelf registration statement are adequate to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of per common share  the last of which was paid on august  to stockholders of record on august  at september   we had million remaining on a board of directors authorization for repurchases of our common stock 
on november   our board of directors increased the amount authorized for repurchases of our debt from million to million 
in and  we entered into three separate limited partnership agreements with the purpose of investing in start up and emerging growth companies whose technology and business plans had the potential of permitting us to leverage our size  expertise and customer base in the homebuilding industry 
we originally authorized investment of up to million in such companies over a four year period 
in january  the original million authorization was reduced to the million that had been invested in such companies as of that date 
the investments are concentrated in e commerce businesses that serve the homebuilding  real estate and financial service industries  as well as in businesses whose strategic focus allowed for the diversification of our operations 
as of september   the carrying value of our investments in such companies  all accounted for under the cost method and reported in homebuilding other assets  amounted to million 
except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes  the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes  at september   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation also increases our financing  labor and material costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
safe harbor statement certain statements contained in this report  as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission  statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts  stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us  may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate  believe  expect  estimate  project and future 
any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements 
the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us 
other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us 
general economic  real estate and other conditions the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
any oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding  the availability and cost of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns 
increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing 
any future increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less affordable 
governmental regulations and environmental matters we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and homebuilding process  including zoning  density and building standards 
such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays  increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas 
substantial debt we have a significant amount of debt 
the amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other requirements 
it could also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 
competitive conditions the homebuilding industry is very competitive 
in each of the markets we serve  we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers  desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  the need for increased selling incentives  lower sales or delays in construction 
availability of capital our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to obtain capital from the sale of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings 
increases in interest rates  changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies  concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy  changing lending objectives of financial institutions  or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future 
growth strategies since  we have acquired many homebuilding companies 
although we are currently focusing on internal growth  we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future 
successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available 
although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past  we can give no assurance that  when we resume our acquisition activity  we will be able to successfully identify  acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future 
moreover  we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt 
we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings 
we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance  repurchase or repay such debt 
our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
when it was adopted on october  we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 
our financial services segment is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
most mortgage loans are funded at fixed interest rates before they are committed to third party investors 
interest rate lock commitments irlc s are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  irlc s will have a duration of less than six months 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities are designated as fair value hedges against the risk of changes to the overall fair value of funded loans 
accordingly  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings  as are the changes in the value of the funded loans 
the effectiveness of the fair value hedge is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness  which for the years ended september  and  was not significant  is recognized in current earnings 
interest rate risk associated with irlc s is managed through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  forward sales of mortgage backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments 
both the irlc s and these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
at september   forward sales of mortgage backed securities related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and irlc s totaled approximately million 
at september   the fair value of the net forward sales and irlc s was million 
the following table sets forth  as of september   for our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
in addition  the table sets forth the notional amounts  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps
