likewise  the company s current ratio decreased to at august  from at august   due to the higher proportional increase in current liabilities 
the company sells substantially all of its trade receivables to a factor cit on a pre approved  non recourse basis 
the company attempts to make any recourse shipments on a cod basis or ensure that the customers payments are backed by a commercial or standby letter of credit issued by the customers bank 
the amount of the company s receivables which were recourse and were not made on a cod basis or supported by commercial or standby letters of credit at august  was approximately  of which approximately  has been collected through october  payment for non recourse factored receivables is made at the time customers make payment to cit or  if a customer is financially unable to make payment  within approximately days of the invoice due date

other information inventory in its ordinary course of operations  the company generally makes some sales below its normal selling prices or below cost 
based on experience  management believes this will be true for some inventory held on or acquired after august  the amount of such sales depends on several factors  including general economic conditions  market conditions within the apparel industry  the desirability of the styles held in inventory and competitive pressures from other garment suppliers 
the company s inventory decreased from million at august  to million at august  the company has established an inventory markdown reserve as of august   which management believes will be sufficient for current inventory that is expected to be sold below cost in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize its expected selling prices or that the inventory markdown reserve will be adequate for items in inventory as of august  for which customer sales orders have not yet been received 
the inventory markdown reserve is calculated based on specific identification of aged goods and styles that are slow moving or selling off price 
impact of exchange rates while the company purchased over of its products from foreign manufacturers in fiscal  all of its purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
because the company s products are sold primarily in the united states  in dollar denominated transactions  the company does not engage in currency hedging to reduce currency risk 
a prolonged increase in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies could enhance the company s purchasing power for new purchase orders and reduce its cost of goods sold 
conversely  a prolonged decrease in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies could result in an increase in the company s cost of manufacturing for new purchase orders and costs of goods sold 
impact of inflation and deflation management does not believe that inflation has had any material impact upon the company s revenues or income from operations to date 
management believes that the apparel sector in which the company operates has been in a period of deflation  contrary to the modest inflation experienced in the economy in general 
the persistence of the consumer to buy on sale merchandise has put pressure on retail gross margins  which in turn has led to downward pressure from retailers on wholesale gross margins 
without a corresponding decrease in fabric and labor prices  this has led to a decline in wholesale gross margins 
management believes these modest deflationary pressures will continue into the foreseeable future
